abstract = {As a result of the work carried out for the Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the book Impact of Climate Change and Adaptation Measures in Cuba was published under the AMA Editorial stamp, which integrates the scientific results of rigor provided by 127 researchers, professors and professionals from 27 institutions and organizations in the country. The work, in its nine chapters of technical content, updates and brings knowledge about the changes observed in the climate of Cuba; it presents the most probable climatic scenarios for 2050 and 2100, and on this basis evaluates and characterizes the current status of a group of socioeconomic sectors and natural resources prioritized for the country; It develops the hydrological and oceanographic scenarios that, together with the climatic ones, allowed to determine the impacts of climate change on the sectors and natural resources addressed, and propose adaptation measures. The chapters of the book are: 1. Introduction; 2. Cuba: geography, economy and society; 3. Variations and changes in the climate; 4. Climate scenarios; 5. Water resources; 6. Coastal areas and marine resources; 7). Biological Diversity; 8). Forests; 9. Farming; 10. Human settlements and land use; and 11. Human health. The work offers a perspective of the future and certain policy options to solve the problems that result from the impact of climate change. Likewise, the work identifies information and knowledge gaps; suggests possible ways of acting of the actors in relation to the integration and interconnection of socio-economic sectors with a view to developing and implementing policies and for the creation of new and improved capacities. The relevant aspects of the book's content are summarized below. Variations and changes in the weather; impact on potential water availability At present, the climate of Cuba has a similar status to that projected by the IPCC for an intensified greenhouse effect in the Earth's atmosphere. With respect to the baseline 1961-1990, there is an increase of 0.9 {\textordmasculine}C for the average surface temperature of the air; an increase of 1.9 ° C in the average minimum temperature; a significant reduction of the diurnal temperature range; a higher frequency of prolonged and severe droughts, especially in the summer; an increase in heavy rainfall in winter; and a 10{\%} reduction in annual rainfall. Likewise, there has been an increase in the temperatures of the sea surface and the lower layer of the troposphere. The variation in the rainfall regime has implied a progressive reduction of the available potential water resources. The reduction in the potential availability of water is strongly reflected in the decrease in the volume of usable water, as a consequence not only of the reduction of precipitation, but also because of the increase in competition for water between ecosystems and human demand Future climatic, hydrological and coastal marine scenarios Using the PRECIS Regional Model, with a resolution between 50 km2 and 25 km2, the climate of the future is represented with a high concordance index in the projections for temperature and precipitation. The climatic scenarios considered most probable for Cuba express that the average air temperature can increase between 2.6 {\textordmasculine}C and 4.5 {\textordmasculine}C, and the annual rainfall could decrease between 15{\%} and 60{\%} with respect to the current values. In one of the most favorable climatic scenarios in relation to water, its potential availability in 2100 could be reduced to 24 km3, that is, 37{\%} less if compared to the baseline 1961-1990. In any of the most likely climatic scenarios, the water balance demonstrates a significant reduction in potential water. The Cuban insular platform, and the way in which the seas adjacent to Cuba are related to the ocean, will undergo significant changes; among these: the gradual modification of the physico-geographical, hydrographic and hydroclimatic characteristics of the insular platform and the coastline; the considerable reduction of the low areas of the archipelago and the disappearance of keys; the increase in tidal fluctuations and non-periodic variations in sea level, which will increase during severe atmospheric events; the retreat of the coast to a maximum of 7 km and the alteration in the spatial distribution of the sediments. This coastal marine scenario, combined with the reduction of precipitation, will reinforce the potential freshwater availability deficit because of the impact it will have on marine intrusion into coastal aquifers. A probable scenario in these aquifers by 2100, maintaining the current exploitation regime, reflects that with an increase in the average sea level up to 85 cm and a 25{\%} reduction in rainfall during the wet period, saline intrusion in the direction horizontally it would advance between 4 km and 5 km, while in the vertical sense an ascent would be expected between 19 m and 21 m. This situation would imply a significant reduction in the delivery of groundwater and, in low-powered coastal aquifers, it could represent their disappearance due to the definitive salinization of their reserves. Impacts of climate change and adaptation As evidenced in future water scenarios, the water resources sector will be one of the most severely affected, which will have a very large implication in other resources and sectors. Given the manifest changes in the climate, this sector is already under great stress. The current tension in water management will increase in the future and will be more difficult, even solving the main problems facing this sector in the present. The basis for a better adaptation in this sector is required: the detailed reassessment of the volume of usable water; the reassessment of the hydrology of existing hydraulic works; the revitalization of a hydraulic system with many years of exploitation; adequate deposition of contaminating residuals; the increase in water reuse; the eradication of the numerous losses in the supply network from sources and intra-home networks; execute the technological changes necessary to increase the efficiency of the operation of the hydraulic system at the sources and their final destinations. In the future the competition between water availability and growing human demand will be expanded. The adaptation of the water sector to climate change has been mainly preventive; There is a package of actions of political and management scope, aimed at introducing or expanding solutions for this challenge. Biological diversity, as well as the functioning and balance of ecosystems, in addition to the pressure they are subjected to by human intervention, will suffer the combined blow of coastal climatic, hydrological and marine scenarios. The increase in air temperature, the decrease in precipitation, the increase in sea salinity due to the decrease in freshwater runoff towards the platform and the retreat of the coastline, will negatively gravitate over all species of the ﬂ ora and wildlife Many terrestrial and marine species are very vulnerable to climate change, and could be in danger of extinction due to significant transformations in their habitat and biology. They would manage to arrive at invasive animal and plant species in search of more appropriate habitats. Pests and vectors will have favorable conditions for their spread, thereby increasing the danger of diseases in humans, animals and plants. Adaptation measures for biological diversity should have as a starting point the identification of the impacts of climate change on all biological groups and ecosystems, and the incorporation of this knowledge in the management of the National System of Protected Areas. In this sense, there are important measures, such as the conservation and (or) recovery of coastal wetlands, especially mangroves; the conservation and use of genetic resources, especially endemics related to agricultural crops, to contribute to food security; the deepening of knowledge about the goods and services of biological diversity; reforestation will continue to be an appropriate adaptive practice; In the case of pests and vectors, adaptation measures should be directed to counteract them with prevention policies that promote the use of organic techniques and mainly sanitary and sanitary measures Agriculture will develop in an environment affected by the increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts, the aridization of the climate, the decrease in real evapotranspiration of ecosystems and a pronounced water deficit. Net primary productivity and potential biomass density will decline; the duration in days of the phenological phases of important crops and the total duration of the crop cycles will be progressively shortened; and the potential returns will decrease. The combined scenarios of rising temperatures, falling rainfall, decreasing water potential and water quality, accompanied by the reduction of agricultural areas given the retreat of the coast and the migration of coastal ecosystems, will lead to higher impacts on total agricultural production and animal husbandry than those estimated by the direct impact of rising temperatures and reduced rainfall. In the agricultural sector, adaptation will require the use of technologies for the protection of crops and livestock; obtaining and introducing crop varieties with higher potential yields, as well as cattle breeds resistant to high temperatures and water deficit; and changes in the range of crops, which should be implemented as the climate evolves. The population will suffer the total impact of climate change, which will decrease their quality of life and increase the risk of certain extreme hydrometeorological diseases and events. This could manifest itself in different ways: the appearance of changes in the food culture of Cubans; also, for a significant number of people linked to agricultural and fishery production, there would be a transformation in e},

abstract = {The fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) was used to dynamically downscale two Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM) simulations of the transient climate change for the period 1950–2100, over North America, following the CORDEX protocol. The CRCM5 was driven by data from the CanESM2 and MPI-ESM-LR CGCM simulations, based on the historical (1850–2005) and future (2006–2100) RCP4.5 radiative forcing scenario. The results show that the CRCM5 simulations reproduce relatively well the current-climate North American regional climatic features, such as the temperature and precipitation multiannual means, annual cycles and temporal variability at daily scale. A cold bias was noted during the winter season over western and southern portions of the continent. CRCM5-simulated precipitation accumulations at daily temporal scale are much more realistic when compared with its driving CGCM simulations, especially in summer when small-scale driven convective precipitation has a large contribution over land. The CRCM5 climate projections imply a general warming over the continent in the 21st century, especially over the northern regions in winter. The winter warming is mostly contributed by the lower percentiles of daily temperatures, implying a reduction in the frequency and intensity of cold waves. A precipitation decrease is projected over Central America and an increase over the rest of the continent. For the average precipitation change in summer however there is little consensus between the simulations. Some of these differences can be attributed to the uncertainties in CGCM-projected changes in the position and strength of the Pacific Ocean subtropical high pressure.},

abstract = {High-resolution climate information provided by e.g. regional climate models (RCMs) is valuable for exploring the changing weather under global warming, and assessing the local impact of climate change. While there is generally more confidence in the representativeness of simulated processes at higher resolutions, internal variability of the climate system—‘noise', intrinsic to the chaotic nature of atmospheric and oceanic processes—is larger at smaller spatial scales as well, limiting the predictability of the climate signal. To quantify the internal variability and robustly estimate the climate signal, large initial-condition ensembles of climate simulations conducted with a single model provide essential information. We analyze a regional downscaling of a 16-member initial-condition ensemble over western Europe and the Alps at 0.11° resolution, similar to the highest resolution EURO-CORDEX simulations. We examine the strength of the forced climate response (signal) in mean and extreme daily precipitation with respect to noise due to internal variability, and find robust small-scale geographical features in the forced response, indicating regional differences in changes in the probability of events. However, individual ensemble members provide only limited information on the forced climate response, even for high levels of global warming. Although the results are based on a single RCM–GCM chain, we believe that they have general value in providing insight in the fraction of the uncertainty in high-resolution climate information that is irreducible, and can assist in the correct interpretation of fine-scale information in multi-model ensembles in terms of a forced response and noise due to internal variability.},

abstract = {The El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is considered to be responsible for rainfall predictability in many regions. Some of its regional teleconnections, such as over the Arabian Peninsula in boreal summer (June–August) season, are not well studied. Therefore, in this paper, the relationship between the summer seasonal mean rainfall and ENSO is analyzed with the aid of a 15-member ensemble of simulations using the Saudi-King Abdulaziz University (KAU) Atmospheric Global Climate Model (AGCM) for the period 1981–2015. The southwestern peninsula rainfall is linked to the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the central-eastern pacific region. This relationship is established through an atmospheric teleconnection which shows upper-level convergence anomalies over the southern Arabian Peninsula compensating the central-eastern Pacific upper-level divergence anomalies for the warm ENSO phase, and vice-versa for the cold Phase. The upper-level convergence over the southern Arabian Peninsula leads to sinking motion, low-level divergence and consequently to reduced rainfall in the warm phase, while reverse happens in the cold phase. The correlation coefficient between the observed area-averged Ni{\~{n}}o3.4 index and a Southwestern Arabian Peninsula Rainfall Index (SARI) is −0.43 (statistically significant at 95{\%}). Overall, model shows a potential predictability (PP) of 0.53 for the SARI region. Predictability during El Ni{\~{n}}o is higher than during La Ni{\~{n}}a events. This is not only because of a stronger signal, but also noise reduction contributes to the increase of PP in El Ni{\~{n}}o compared to that of La Ni{\~{n}}a years.},

However, NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) laser altimetry mission now allows us to accurately measure changes in ice-sheet height at subannual time scales. Here, we use ICESat-2 data to estimate height changes over Antarctica between April 2019 and June 2020. These data show widespread increases in surface height over West Antarctica during the 2019 austral winter. Using climate reanalysis data, we show that 41{\%} of increases in height during winter were from snow accumulation via extreme precipitation events—63{\%} of these events were associated with landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) which occurred only 5.1{\%} of the time.},

abstract = {Sixteen historical simulations (1950–2014) from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) are compared to Northeast U.S. observed precipitation and extreme precipitation–related synoptic circulation. A set of metrics based on the regional climate is used to assess how realistically the models simulate the observed distribution and seasonality of extreme precipitation, as well as the synoptic patterns associated with extreme precipitation. These patterns are determined by k -means typing of 500-hPa geopotential heights on extreme precipitation days (top 1{\%} of days with precipitation). The metrics are formulated to evaluate the models' extreme precipitation spatial variations, seasonal frequency, and intensity; and for circulation, the fit to observed patterns, pattern seasonality, and pattern location of extreme precipitation. Based on the metrics, the models vary considerably in their ability to simulate different aspects of regional precipitation, and a realistic simulation of the seasonality and distribution of precipitation does not necessarily correspond to a realistic simulation of the circulation patterns (reflecting the underlying dynamics of the precipitation), and vice versa. This highlights the importance of assessing both precipitation and its associated circulation. While the models vary in their ability to reproduce observed results, in general the higher-resolution models score higher in terms of the metrics. Most models produce more frequent precipitation than that for observations, but capture the seasonality of precipitation intensity well, and capture at least several of the key characteristics of extreme precipitation–related circulation. These results do not appear to reflect a substantial improvement over a similar analysis of selected CMIP5 models.},

Separately modelling ice dynamics and SMB is the only way to project future trends. In addition, mass balance studies frequently use regional climate models (RCMs) outputs as an alternative to observed fields because SMB observations are particularly scarce on the ice sheet. Here we evaluate new simulations of the polar RCM MAR forced by three reanalyses, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and MERRA-2, for the period 1979–2015, and we compare MAR results to the last outputs of the RCM RACMO2 forced by ERA-Interim. We show that MAR and RACMO2 perform similarly well in simulating coast-to-plateau SMB gradients, and we find no significant differences in their simulated SMB when integrated over the ice sheet or its major basins. More importantly, we outline and quantify missing or underestimated processes in both RCMs. Along stake transects, we show that both models accumulate too much snow on crests, and not enough snow in valleys, as a result of drifting snow transport fluxes not included in MAR and probably underestimated in RACMO2 by a factor of 3. Our results tend to confirm that drifting snow transport and sublimation fluxes are much larger than previous model-based estimates and need to be better resolved and constrained in climate models. Sublimation of precipitating particles in low-level atmospheric layers is responsible for the significantly lower snowfall rates in MAR than in RACMO2 in katabatic channels at the ice sheet margins.

abstract = {The GLACIOCLIM-SAMBA (GS) Antarctic accumulation monitoring network, which extends from the coast of Adelie Land to the Antarctic plateau, has been surveyed annually since 2004. The network includes a 156-km stake-line from the coast inland, along which accumulation shows high spatial and interannual variability with a mean value of 362 mm water equivalent a−1. In this paper, this accumulation is compared with older accumulation reports from between 1971 and 1991. The mean and annual standard deviation and the km-scale spatial pattern of accumulation were seen to be very similar in the older and more recent data. The data did not reveal any significant accumulation trend over the last 40 years. The ECMWF analysis-based forecasts (ERA-40 and ERA-Interim), a stretched-grid global general circulation model (LMDZ4) and three regional circulation models (PMM5, MAR and RACMO2), all with high resolution over Antarctica (27–125 km), were tested against the GS reports. They qualitatively reproduced the meso-scale spatial pattern of the annual-mean accumulation except MAR. MAR significantly underestimated mean accumulation, while LMDZ4 and RACMO2 overestimated it. ERA-40 and the regional models that use ERA-40 as lateral boundary condition qualitatively reproduced the chronology of interannual variability but underestimated the magnitude of interannual variations. Two widely used climatologies for Antarctic accumulation agreed well with the mean GS data. The model-based climatology was also able to reproduce the observed spatial pattern. These data thus provide new stringent constraints on models and other large-scale evaluations of the Antarctic accumulation.},

abstract = {Abstract. The surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic Ice Sheet cannot be reliably deduced from global climate models (GCMs), both because their spatial resolution is insufficient and because their physics are not adapted for cold and snow-covered regions. By contrast, regional climate models (RCMs) adapted for polar regions can physically and dynamically downscale SMB components over the ice sheet using large-scale forcing at their boundaries. Polar-oriented RCMs require appropriate GCM fields for forcing because the response of the cryosphere to a warming climate is dependent on its initial state and is not linear with respect to temperature increase. In this context, we evaluate the current climate in 41 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) data set over Antarctica by focusing on forcing fields which may have the greatest impact on SMB components simulated by RCMs. Our inter-comparison includes six reanalyses, among which ERA-Interim reanalysis is chosen as a reference over 1979–2014. Model efficiency is assessed taking into account the multi-decadal variability of the fields over the 1850–1980 period. We show that fewer than 10 CMIP5 models show reasonable biases compared to ERA-Interim, among which ACCESS1-3 is the most pertinent choice for forcing RCMs over Antarctica, followed by ACCESS1-0, CESM1-BGC, CESM1-CAM5, NorESM1-M, CCSM4 and EC-EARTH. Finally, climate change over the Southern Ocean in CMIP5 is less sensitive to the global warming signal than it is to the present-day simulated sea-ice extent and to the feedback between sea-ice decrease and air temperature increase around Antarctica.},

abstract = {Understanding how extremes are changing globally, regionally, and locally is an important first step for planning appropriate adaptation measures, as changes in extremes have major impacts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's synthesis of global extremes was not able to say anything about western central Africa, as no analysis of the region was available nor was there an adequate internationally exchanged long-term daily data set available to use for analysis of extremes. This paper presents the first analysis of extremes in this climatically important region along with analysis of Guinea Conakry and Zimbabwe. As per many other parts of the world, the analysis shows a decrease in cold extremes and an increase in warm extremes. However, while the majority of the analyzed world has shown an increase in heavy precipitation over the last half century, central Africa showed a decrease. Furthermore, the companion analysis of Guinea Conakry and Zimbabwe showed no significant increases. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The problem of climate change in Turkmenistan is one of the most pressing environmental problems due to the geographical location of the country. Turkmenistan is one of the countries of Central Asia, the second largest by area, located in the southwestern part of the region in the desert zone, north of the Kopetdag ridge of the Turkmen-Khorasan mountain system , between the Caspian Sea in the west and the Amu Darya River in the east. Turkmenistan is characterized by a sharply continental and exceptionally dry climate. The average annual amplitude of air temperature varies between 21-34{\textordmasculine}С. The absolute minimum of air temperature is -36.0{\textordmasculine}С, the absolute maximum + 50.1{\textordmasculine}С. As for many other countries, climate change is a problem in Turkmenistan too. The main indicators of climate change are temperature and precipitation. The relationship between changes in key climate indicators (air temperature and precipitation) with phenomena such as regional drought is studied sporadically and it is difficult to draw certain conclusions. We analyzed the trends in temperature and precipitation (monthly, seasonal, average annual) for 25 hydrometeorological stations as of 2020, 2040, 2060, 2080, 2100 using the MAGICC / SCENGEN software package. The Second National Communications of Turkmenistan will present greenhouse gas inventories, information on climate change policies and measures, forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions, assessments of vulnerability to climate change and adaptability, as well as an assessment of mitigation measures and a number of other topics.},

abstract = {This study examines the relative contribution of extreme daily precipitation events (RR {\textgreater} 99th percentile) to accumulated rainfall over the Arabian Peninsula in current and future climates. Both gridded observations and model simulation data are analyzed. Observations reveal that the extreme daily precipitation events contribute nearly 40{\%} (70{\%}) to the accumulated amount of rainfall in the wet (dry) regions of the Peninsula for the period 1970–1999. The regional climate model simulations show a large overestimation of the annual mean rainfall in the present climate. However, the model data also depicts almost an enhanced contribution of extreme daily precipitation events to the accumulated rainfall over the Peninsula. In agreement with observations, the simulated extreme precipitation events show a small (large) contribution to total rainfall in the wet (dry) regions. The relative contribution of extreme daily precipitation events to total rainfall increases over the southern and central parts of the Peninsula in case of the future climate. We also found an increase in the accumulated amount of simulated precipitation associated with extreme events in the future climate when compared to the reference period. This indicates that extreme events are likely to become more intense over the Peninsula in the future. The results indicate an increase in daily precipitation intensities over the Arabian Peninsula in the future. The results presented in this study highlight that a better understanding of extreme precipitation events and their regional distribution over the Arabian Peninsula currently and in the future is essential for judicious socio-economic planning for the region.},

For Saudi Arabia, the area of which represents almost 80{\%} of the Peninsula, the climatic datasets from its 27 ground observations are analysed for the period 1978-2009, with additional gridded datasets used to describe the observed state and change of the present climate. The gridded datasets represent well the very dry (40-80 mm) area over the world's largest sand desert (Rub Al-Khali), the dry (80-150 mm) area over middle-to-north of Saudi Arabia, and the wettest ({\textgreater}150 mm) region in the southwest of the Peninsula. The annual temperature is relatively high (24-27 °C) in the middle-to-south of the Peninsula and low ({\textless}21 °C) in the northwest and southwest. The highest temperature ({\textgreater}27 °C) is obtained over the Rub Al-Khali. Over Saudi Arabia, the observed annual rainfall showed a significant decreasing trend (47.8 mm per decade) in the last half of the analysis period, with a relatively large interannual variability, while the maximum, mean and minimum temperatures have increased significantly at a rate of 0.71, 0.60, and 0.48 °C per decade, respectively.

abstract = {Background Projections of temperature and precipitation with low uncertainties are key parameters to climate change-related studies. Purpose The projected temperature and precipitation and their uncertainties over the Arabian Peninsula for the 21st century for three CMIP5 multimodel ensembles under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are examined in this paper. Methods Analyzing the performance of 30 CMIP5 model individually, they are categorized into three groups for the present climate (1976–2005). By applying simple model averaging ensemble method, three multimodel ensemble means, namely: (i) all CMIP5 models ensemble (AME), (ii) selected CMIP5 models ensemble (SME), and (iii) best-performing CMIP5 models ensemble (BME) are developed. Results Over the Arabian Peninsula, a continuous rise in temperature is obtained in all three ensembles (i.e., AME, SME, and BME) in the 21st century. The BME shows enhanced changes in temperature at the end of 21st century as compared to AME and SME. Moreover, the BME shows a remarkable reduction in uncertainties for the projected temperature. The AME, SME, and BME show strong inter-annual variability for the projected precipitation over the peninsula. Compared to AME and SME, the BME revealed enhanced positive change in the annual mean precipitation by the end of 21st century. Conclusions Regionally, southern/northwestern areas of the peninsula receive enhanced/reduced future precipitation as compared to the present climate. The differences in the projected precipitation and temperature signals increase largely between the three ensembles towards the end of 21st century. Therefore, it is concluded that selecting the best-performing models may lead a better planning by the policy makers and stakeholder for the region.},

abstract = {This paper presents the changes in projected temperature and precipitation over the Arabian Peninsula for the twenty-first century using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) dataset. The changes are obtained by analyzing the multimodel ensemble from 31 CMIP6 models for the near (2030–2059) and far (2070–2099) future periods, with reference to the base period 1981–2010, under three future Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Observations show that the annual temperature is rising at the rate of 0.63 ˚C decade –1 (significant at the 99{\%} confidence level), while annual precipitation is decreasing at the rate of 6.3 mm decade –1 (significant at the 90{\%} confidence level), averaged over Saudi Arabia. For the near (far) future period, the 66{\%} likely ranges of annual-averaged temperature is projected to increase by 1.2–1.9 (1.2–2.1) ˚C, 1.4–2.1 (2.3–3.4) ˚C, and 1.8–2.7 (4.1–5.8) ˚C under SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, and SSP5–8.5, respectively. Higher warming is projected in the summer than in the winter, while the Northern Arabian Peninsula (NAP) is projected to warm more than Southern Arabian Peninsula (SAP), by the end of the twenty-first century. For precipitation, a dipole-like pattern is found, with a robust increase in annual mean precipitation over the SAP, and a decrease over the NAP. The 66{\%} likely ranges of annual-averaged precipitation over the whole Arabian Peninsula is projected to change by 5 to 28 (–3 to 29) {\%}, 5 to 31 (4 to 49) {\%}, and 1 to 38 (12 to 107) {\%} under SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, and SSP5–8.5, respectively, in the near (far) future. Overall, the full ranges in CMIP6 remain higher than the CMIP5 models, which points towards a higher climate sensitivity of some of the CMIP6 climate models to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as compared to the CMIP5. The CMIP6 dataset confirmed previous findings of changes in future climate over the Arabian Peninsula based on CMIP3 and CMIP5 datasets. The results presented in this study will be useful for impact studies, and ultimately in devising future policies for adaptation in the region.},

abstract = {The observed records of recent decades show increased economic damage associated with flash flooding in different regions of Saudi Arabia. An increase in extreme rainfall events may cause severe repercussions for the socio-economic sectors of the country. The present study investigated the observed rainfall trends and associated extremes over Saudi Arabia for the 42-year period of 1978–2019. It measured the contribution of extreme events to the total rainfall and calculated the changes to mean and extreme rainfall events over five different climate regions of Saudi Arabia. Rainfall indices were constructed by estimating the extreme characteristics associated with daily rainfall frequency and intensity. The analysis reveals that the annual rainfall is decreasing (5.89 mm decade−1, significant at the 90{\%} level) over Saudi Arabia for the entire analysis period, while it increased in the most recent decade. On a monthly scale, the most significant increase (5.44 mm decade−1) is observed in November and the largest decrease (1.20 mm decade−1) in January. The frequency of intense rainfall events is increasing for the majority of stations over Saudi Arabia, while the frequency of weak events is decreasing. More extreme rainfall events are occurring in the northwest, east, and southwest regions of Saudi Arabia. A daily rainfall of ≥ 26 mm is identified as the threshold for an extreme event. It is found that the contribution of extreme events to the total rainfall amount varies from region to region and season to season. The most considerable contribution (up to 56{\%}) is found in the southern region in June. Regionally, significant contribution comes from the coastal region, where extreme events contribute, on average, 47{\%} of the total rainfall each month from October to February, with the largest (53{\%}) in November. For the entire country, extreme rainfall contributes most (52{\%}) in November and least (20{\%}) in July, while contributions from different stations are in the 8–50{\%} range of the total rainfall.},

abstract = {We analyze data of 27 global climate models from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), and examine projected changes in temperature and precipitation over the African continent during the twenty-first century. The temperature and precipitation changes are computed for two future time slices, 2030–2059 (near term) and 2070–2099 (long term), relative to the present climate (1981–2010), for the entire African continent and its eight subregions. The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble projected a continuous and significant increase in the mean annual temperature over all of Africa and its eight subregions during the twenty-first century. The mean annual temperature over Africa for the near (long)-term period is projected to increase by 1.2 °C (1.4 °C), 1.5 °C (2.3 °C), and 1.8 °C (4.4 °C) under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for weak, moderate, and strong forcing, referenced as SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The future warming is not uniform over Africa and varies regionally. By the end of the twenty-first century, the largest rise in mean annual temperature (5.6 °C) is projected over the Sahara, while the smallest rise (3.5 °C) is over Central East Africa, under the strong forcing SSP5-8.5 scenario. The projected boreal winter and summer temperature patterns for the twenty-first century show spatial distributions similar to the annual patterns. Uncertainty associated with projected temperature over Africa and its eight subregions increases with time and reaches a maximum by the end of the twenty-first century. On the other hand, the precipitation projections over Africa during the twenty-first century show large spatial variability and seasonal dependency. The northern and southern parts of Africa show a reduction in precipitation, while the central parts of Africa show an increase, in future climates under the three reference scenarios. For the near (long)-term periods, the area-averaged precipitation over Africa is projected to increase by 6.2 (4.8){\%}, 6.8 (8.5){\%}, and 9.5 (15.2){\%} under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The median warming simulated by the CMIP6 model ensemble remains higher than the CMIP5 ensemble over most of Africa, reaching as high as 2.5 °C over some regions, while precipitation shows a mixed spatial pattern.},

abstract = {Climate change is posing severe threats to human health through its impacts on food, water supply, and weather. Saudi Arabia has frequently experienced record-breaking climate extremes over the last decade, which have had adverse socioeconomic effects on many sectors of the country. The present study explores the changes in average temperature and temperature extremes over Saudi Arabia using an updated daily temperature dataset for the period 1978–2019. Also, changes in frequency and percentile trends of extreme events, as well as in absolute threshold-based temperature extremes, are analyzed at seasonal and annual time scales. The results are robust in showing an increase in both temperature trends and temperature extremes averaged over the second period (2000–2019) when compared to the first period (1980–1999). Over the period 1978–2019, the minimum temperature for the country increased (0.64°C per decade) at a higher rate than the maximum temperature (0.60°C per decade). The rate of increase in the minimum and maximum temperatures was reported as 0.48 and 0.71°C per decade, respectively, for the period 1978–2009. The minimum temperature increased by 0.81°C per decade for the second period compared to an increase of 0.47°C per decade for the first period. The significant increase in minimum temperature has resulted in a decreasing linear trend in the diurnal temperature range over recent decades. The maximum (minimum) temperature increased at a higher rate for Jan-Mar (Jun-Nov) with the highest increase of 0.82 (0.89)°C per decade occurring in March (August). The analysis shows a substantial increase (decrease) in the number of warm (cold) days/nights over the second period compared to the first period. The number of warm days (nights) significantly increased by about 13 (21) days per decade, and there is a significant decrease of about 11 (13) days per decade of cold days (nights). The seasonal analysis shows that this increase in warm days/nights is enhanced in boreal summer, with a reduction in the number of cold days/nights in winter. These results indicate that the warming climate of Saudi Arabia is accelerating in recent decades, which may have severe socioeconomic repercussions in many sectors of the country.},

abstract = {The latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) dataset was analyzed to examine the projected changes in temperature and precipitation over six South Asian countries during the twenty-first century. The CMIP6 model simulations reveal biases in annual mean temperature and precipitation over South Asia in the present climate. In the historical period, the median of the CMIP6 model ensemble systematically underestimates the annual mean temperature for all the South Asian countries, while a mixed behavior is shown in the case of precipitation. In the future climate, the CMIP6 models display higher sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions over South Asia compared with the CMIP5 models. The multimodel ensemble from 27 CMIP6 models projects a continuous increase in the annual mean temperature over South Asia during the twenty-first century under three future scenarios. The projected temperature shows a large increase (over 6 °C under SSP5-8.5 scenario) over the northwestern parts of South Asia, comprising the complex Karakorum and Himalayan mountain ranges. Any large increase in the mean temperature over this region will most likely result in a faster rate of glacier melting. By the end of the twenty-first century, the annual mean temperature (uncertainty range) over South Asia is projected to increase by 1.2 (0.7–2.1) °C, 2.1 (1.5–3.3) °C, and 4.3 (3.2–6.6) °C under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, relative to the present (1995–2014) climate. The warming over South Asia is also continuous on the seasonal time scale. The CMIP6 models projected higher warming in the winter season than in the summer over South Asia, which if verified will have repercussions for snow/ice accumulations as well as winter cropping patterns. The annual mean precipitation is also projected to increase over South Asia during the twenty-first century under all scenarios. The rate of change in the projected annual mean precipitation varies considerably between the South Asian countries. By the end of the twenty-first century, the country-averaged annual mean precipitation (uncertainty range) is projected to increase by 17.1 (2.2–49.1){\%} in Bangladesh, 18.9 (−4.9 to 72){\%} in Bhutan, 27.3 (5.3–160.5){\%} in India, 19.5 (−5.9 to 95.6){\%} in Nepal, 26.4 (6.4–159.7){\%} in Pakistan, and 25.1 (−8.5 to 61.0){\%} in Sri Lanka under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The seasonal precipitation projections also shows large variability. The projected winter precipitation reveals a robust increase over the western Himalayas, with a corresponding decrease over the eastern Himalayas. On the other hand, the summer precipitation shows a robust increase over most of the South Asia region, with the largest increase over the arid region of southern Pakistan and adjacent areas of India, under the high-emission scenario. The results presented in this study give detailed insights into CMIP6 model performance over the South Asia region, which could be extended further to develop adaptation strategies, and may act as a guideline document for climate change related policymaking in the region.},

abstract = {The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) dataset is used to examine projected changes in temperature and precipitation over the United States (U.S.), Central America and the Caribbean. The changes are computed using an ensemble of 31 models for three future time slices (2021–2040, 2041–2060, and 2080–2099) relative to the reference period (1995–2014) under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs; SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5). The CMIP6 ensemble reproduces the observed annual cycle and distribution of mean annual temperature and precipitation with biases between − 0.93 and 1.27 °C and − 37.90 to 58.45{\%}, respectively, for most of the region. However, modeled precipitation is too large over the western and Midwestern U.S. during winter and spring and over the North American monsoon region in summer, while too small over southern Central America. Temperature is projected to increase over the entire domain under all three SSPs, by as much as 6 °C under SSP5-8.5, and with more pronounced increases in the northern latitudes over the regions that receive snow in the present climate. Annual precipitation projections for the end of the twenty-first century have more uncertainty, as expected, and exhibit a meridional dipole-like pattern, with precipitation increasing by 10–30{\%} over much of the U.S. and decreasing by 10–40{\%} over Central America and the Caribbean, especially over the monsoon region. Seasonally, precipitation over the eastern and central subregions is projected to increase during winter and spring and decrease during summer and autumn. Over the monsoon region and Central America, precipitation is projected to decrease in all seasons except autumn. The analysis was repeated on a subset of 9 models with the best performance in the reference period; however, no significant difference was found, suggesting that model bias is not strongly influencing the projections.},

The data set has been carefully quality controlled and checked for homogeneity. Although of low density (21 stations) and relatively short time period, a clear picture of climate change in the region has emerged. The general pattern of the AP mean annual temperature trend is one of warming, with 14 of 21 stations show statistically significant warming at 0.05 level and most at 0.001 level and only one (Seeb) showing statistically significant cooling. The highest statistically significant mean annual warming trends are found in Oman (Sur = 1.03°C decade-1) and Emirates (Dubai = 0.81°C decade-1). The season of maximum warming in mean temperature is March to April. The highest monthly mean temperature trend in the AP occurs in Sur in May (1.47°C decade-1). There is a broad statistically significant increase in mean annual maximum temperature in AP in 12 out of 21 stations, with the highest trends in central and eastern/southeastern AP. Only SW AP and the Gulf of Oman do not show warming. The highest monthly maximum temperature trend in the AP occurs in Bahrain in March (2.27°C decade-1). The second highest significant warming trends are reported in Doha in February (1.54°C decade-1). For minimum temperature, 16 out of 21 stations show statistically significant warming trends, with the highest annual trends observed in the Emirates (Dubai = 1.24°C decade-1), northwest Oman (Sohar = 1.17°C decade-1) and Qatar (Doha = 1.13°C decade-1). The highest monthly minimum temperature warming rate occurred in October. Both Dubai and Kuwait reported the highest significant rate of 2.00°C decade-1. The general mean annual diurnal temperature range trend is negative in the AP, with six out of 21 stations show statistically significant negative trends while three stations show statistically significant positive trends. Trends in mean annual precipitation are significant at only two stations which show a decrease in precipitation. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The large number of cores was used to calculate stacked records of SMB and $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O, which considerably increased the signal-to-noise ratio compared to earlier studies and facilitated the detection of climatic signals. Considerable differences between cores from the interior plateau and the coastal cores were found. The $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O of both the plateau and the ice shelf cores exhibit a slight positive trend over the second half of the 20th century. In the corresponding period, the SMB has a negative trend in the ice shelf cores, but increases on the plateau. Comparison with meteorological data from Neumayer Station revealed that for the ice shelf regions, atmospheric dynamic effects are more important than thermodynamics while on the plateau; the temporal variations of SMB and $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O occur mostly in parallel, and thus can be explained by thermodynamic effects. The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) has exhibited a positive trend since the mid-1960s, which is assumed to lead to a cooling of East Antarctica. This is not confirmed by the firn core data in our data set. Changes in the atmospheric circulation that result in a changed seasonal distribution of precipitation/accumulation could partly explain the observed features in the ice shelf cores.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Rainfall variability change under global warming is a crucial issue that may have a substantial impact on society and the environment, as it can directly impact biodiversity, agriculture, and water resources. Observed precipitation trends and climate change projections over Brazil indicate that many sectors of society are potentially highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The purpose of this study is to assess model projections of the change in rainfall variability at various temporal scales over sub-regions of Brazil. For this, daily data from 30 CMIP5 models for historical (1900- 2005) and future (2050-2100) experiments under a high-emission scenario are used. We assess the change in precipitation variability, applying a band-passfilter to isolate variability on daily, weekly, monthly, intra-seasonal, and ENSO time scales. For historical climate, simulated precipitation is evaluated against observations to establish model reliability. The results show that models largely agree on increases in variability on all timescales in all sub-regions, except on ENSO timescales where models do not agree on the sign of future change. Brazil will experience more rainfall variability in the future i.e., drier or more frequent dry periods and wetter wet periods on daily, weekly, monthly and intra-seasonal timescales, even in sub-regions where future changes in mean rainfall are currently uncertain. This may provide useful information for climate change adaptation across, for example, the agriculture and water resource sectors in Brazil},

abstract = {One of the major impacts in the Amazon region of climate change would be possible changes in the rainy and dry seasons in terms of duration (onset and demise), intensity and spatial and temporal rainfall variability. These changes may have impacts on forest composition, structure, and function as well as the water resources in Amazon basin. Therefore, the aim of this study is: to assess the possible changes in the present-day climate and long-term trends in seasonal rainfall; to identify possible future climate changes across Amaz{\^{o}}nia using regional climate dynamic downscaling; and to evaluate the impact of land surface changes on the climate of Amazon basin, particularly on the seasonal rainfall variability. To achieve these goals, we analyzed the observed rainfall data in the period 1979-2014, climate projections generated by regional climate model HadRM3P, nested in a subset of four HadCM3 global model simulations which are obtained by Perturbed Physics Ensembles method (PPEs) in A1B emission scenario. The regional model simulations were carried out in the period 1961-2010, with the implementation of deforestation scenarios in the HadRM3P. Our results highlights: (a) the signs of observed changes in the variability of precipitation in recent decades, in particular systematic reductions in rainfall accumulation, decrease the length of wet season rainfall (-0.23 pentad/year) and increase the duration of the dry season (0.21 pentad/year) over southern Amazon (SAMZ); (b) the potential impacts of climate change are reducing rainfall over great part of the northeast Amazon for all seasons and also annual mean, while in the southern Amazon it is projected to rainfall increase during the summer and reduction in winter and spring season. Furthermore, there is a tendency to increase the extreme rainfall events, such as extreme flood and drought; and (c) the model simulations showed deforestation impacts on regional climate through the mesoscale circulation (known as vegetation-breeze) induced by juxtaposition of deforested and forested lands. In a broader context, the regional impacts of deforestation are air temperature, Bowen ratio (reduction of sensible heat flux and increasing latent heat), the vertical integrated moisture transport and precipitation increase mainly over deforestation areas which indicating that deforestation has an important contribution on the generation of microclimate and regional climate variability, although the impacts can vary across spatial and temporal scales. Besides, a reduction of extreme wet events and an increase in frequency of extremes and very extremes dry events. Finally, the study has an impact on biodiversity, agriculture, water resources and therefore with significant environmental and socioeconomic implications.},

abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that the timing and intensity of the Central American Midsummer Drought (MSD) may be changing, while observations from limited meteorological station data and paleoclimate reconstructions show neither significant nor consistent trends in seasonal rainfall. Climate model simulations project robust future drying across the region, but internal variability is expected to dominate until the end of the century. Here we use a high-resolution gridded precipitation dataset to investigate these apparent discrepancies and to quantify the spatiotemporal complexities of the MSD. We detect spatially variable trends in MSD timing, the amount of rainy season precipitation, the number of consecutive and total dry days, and extreme wet events at the local scale. At the regional scale, we find a positive trend in the duration, but not the magnitude of the MSD, which is dominated by spatially heterogeneous trends and interannual variability linked to large-scale modes of ocean-atmosphere circulation. Although the current climate still reflects predominantly internal variability, some Central American communities are already experiencing significant changes in local characteristics of the MSD. A detailed spatiotemporal understanding of MSD trends and variability can contribute to evidence-based adaptation planning and help reduce the vulnerability of Central American communities to both natural rainfall variability and anthropogenic change.},

abstract = {Characteristic patterns and changes in precipitation and temperature over the Greater Horn of Africa during the 20th and 21st century are analysed based on a sample of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 3 (CMIP3) models output. Analysis of the 11 CMIP3 models indicates that the equatorial eastern Africa region (including the entire Greater Horn of Africa (GHA)) have been experiencing a significant increase in temperature beginning in the early 1980s, in both A1B and A2 scenarios. All the Atmosphere Ocean Global Circulation Models (AOGCMs) analysed represent the correct mean annual cycle of precipitation, but there is a fairly large spread among the models in capturing the dominant bimodal peaks. In particular, all the models tend to overestimate the peak of the October-November-December (OND) season, while at the same time the peak of the March-April-May (MAM) season tends to be centered on May in the models instead of April as observed. The projected changes and probability distribution of minimum (T min) and maximum (T max) temperatures over the GHA sub-region based on PDFs constructed from daily values showed very diverse distributions for the present (1981-2000) and future (2046-2065; 2081-2100) periods. Whereas in the reference (1981-2000) the probability distribution functions (PDFs) constructed for both T min and T max, and during all the seasons had a near normal (but narrow) distribution, those of the future periods were quite diverse but generally very elongated, with significant shifts toward the positive tail. This generally implies that there is consensus among models and the ensemble mean about high likelihood of increase in extreme warmer T min and T max (more so T min) in the future over the GHA region. Our results also show significant increase in the number of days with T min and T max greater the 2 °C (above 1981-2000 average) by the middle as well as the end of 21st century in both the A1B and A1 scenarios. This is especially so during the June, July, and August (JJA) season where all the 92 days of the season indicate projected minimum temperature to increase by more than 2 °C above the 1981-2000 average by the end of 21st century in both scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Abstract We present high-resolution near-term ensemble projections of hydroclimatic changes over the contiguous U.S. using a regional climate model (RegCM4) that dynamically downscales 11 global climate models from the fifth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project at 18 km horizontal grid spacing. All model integrations span 41 years in the historical period (1965–2005) and 41 years in the near-term future period (2010–2050) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 and cover a domain that includes the contiguous U.S. and parts of Canada and Mexico. Should emissions continue to rise, surface temperatures in every region within the U.S. will reach a new climate norm well before mid 21st century regardless of the magnitudes of regional warming. Significant warming will likely intensify the regional hydrological cycle through the acceleration of the historical trends in cold, warm, and wet extremes. The future temperature response will be partly regulated by changes in snow hydrology over the regions that historically receive a major portion of cold season precipitation in the form of snow. Our results indicate the existence of the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling at regional scales where per degree centigrade rise in surface temperature will lead to a 7.4{\%} increase in precipitation from extremes. More importantly, both winter (snow) and summer (liquid) extremes are projected to increase across the U.S. These changes in precipitation characteristics will be driven by a shift toward shorter and wetter seasons. Overall, projected changes in the regional hydroclimate can have substantial impacts on the natural and human systems across the U.S.},

abstract = {We use an unprecedented ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) projections over seven regional CORDEX domains to provide, for the first time, an RCM-based global view of monsoon changes at various levels of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. All regional simulations are conducted using RegCM4 at a 25 km horizontal grid spacing using lateral and lower boundary forcing from three General Circulation Models (GCMs), which are part of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5). Each simulation covers the period from 1970 through 2100 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Regional climate simulations exhibit high fidelity in capturing key characteristics of precipitation and atmospheric dynamics across monsoon regions in the historical period. In the future period, regional monsoons exhibit a spatially robust delay in the monsoon onset, an increase in seasonality, and a reduction in the rainy season length at higher levels of radiative forcing. All regions with substantial delays in the monsoon onset exhibit a decrease in pre-monsoon precipitation, indicating a strong connection between pre-monsoon drying and a shift in the monsoon onset. The weakening of latent heat driven atmospheric warming during the pre-monsoon period delays the overturning of atmospheric subsidence in the monsoon regions, which defers their transitioning into deep convective states. Monsoon changes under the RCP2.6 scenario are mostly within the baseline variability.},

abstract = {We use an unprecedented ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) projections over seven regional CORDEX domains to provide, for the first time, an RCM-based global view of monsoon changes at various levels of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. All regional simulations are conducted using RegCM4 at a 25 km horizontal grid spacing using lateral and lower boundary forcing from three General Circulation Models (GCMs), which are part of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5). Each simulation covers the period from 1970 through 2100 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Regional climate simulations exhibit high fidelity in capturing key characteristics of precipitation and atmospheric dynamics across monsoon regions in the historical period. In the future period, regional monsoons exhibit a spatially robust delay in the monsoon onset, an increase in seasonality, and a reduction in the rainy season length at higher levels of radiative forcing. All regions with substantial delays in the monsoon onset exhibit a decrease in pre-monsoon precipitation, indicating a strong connection between pre-monsoon drying and a shift in the monsoon onset. The weakening of latent heat driven atmospheric warming during the pre-monsoon period delays the overturning of atmospheric subsidence in the monsoon regions, which defers their transitioning into deep convective states. Monsoon changes under the RCP2.6 scenario are mostly within the baseline variability.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 An assessment of the Extreme Precipitation Events (EPEs) is important because of their potential impacts on the local livelihood, ecosystem, and water resource management. In the present study, the EPEs are defined by applying a non-parametric (95th percentile) approach over different climatic regions of Saudi Arabia using observed daily precipitation data for the period 1984–2016 obtained from 27 meteorological stations. The frequency, composite and correlation analyses are performed to evaluate the statistics of EPEs and their teleconnections. During the wet season (Nov-Apr), the frequency of the EPEs (≥25 mm/day) are higher over northeastern, central and southwestern coastal parts of Saudi Arabia. The composites and correlation analyses show that the EPEs over Saudi Arabia are associated with mid-latitude circumglobal wave train (CGT), which evolves a few days before the onset of EPEs and decays afterwards. The CGT modulates the upper-level trough over the Arabian Peninsula (AP) along with the surface anomalous low-pressure system that enhances moisture convergence, favoring the occurrence of EPEs over the region. The EPEs over Saudi Arabia are also associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which shows that during the positive (negative) ENSO phase the frequency of EPEs increases (decreases) over the country. Moreover, the El Ni{\~{n}}o (with positive CGT) enhances the EPEs frequency over Saudi Arabia while vice-versa happens for La Ni{\~{n}}a (with negative CGT) phase.},

abstract = {This study investigates the long-term variability of surface air temperature (SAT) over the Arabian Peninsula (AP), using data from the Climate Research Unit (TS 3.22) for the 1960–2010 period. The long-term climatology suggests that the warmest AP mean temperatures occur during summer, with the highest temperatures over the northern AP (NAP), due to the monsoon–desert mechanism. During winter, the NAP exhibits low SATs under the influence of western disturbances originating from the Mediterranean. The southwestern AP exhibits the lowest temperatures because of its proximity to the Arabian Sea cold waters, and also because of the orographic effects. The inter-annual variability of the SAT is stronger during winters. A linear trend analysis reveals a significant increase in the SAT anomaly (0.10 °C/decade) across the AP, consistently with the global temperature anomalies. Besides the local convective heating, summer SAT variability is associated with the weakening of the Asian jet stream and a Rossby wave train from the Indian Ocean. This variability is also influenced by the anomalous low pressure over the North Atlantic and the Sahara, a high-pressure system over Siberia and the northwest Pacific. Both in spring and autumn, sea surface temperature (SST) variations over the Indo-western Pacific are highly influenced the AP SATs, whereas winter SATs are modulated by the subtropical jet stream and the Middle East jet stream. In all seasons, the AP SAT is strongly influenced by the SST variations over the tropical oceans. The temperature variability is closely associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO). The warm phase of ENSO (i.e., El Ni{\~{n}}o) is one possible reason behind the inter-annual increase in SAT over the southern AP. The negative phases of NAO and AO also play a role in increasing AP SAT.},

abstract = {A new development in the field of reanalyses is the incorporation of uncertainty estimation capabilities. We have developed a probabilistic regional reanalysis system for the CORDEX-EUR11 domain that is based on the numerical weather prediction model COSMO at a 12-km grid spacing. The lateral boundary conditions of all ensemble members are provided by the global reanalysis ERA-Interim. In the basic implementation of the system, uncertainties due to observation errors are estimated. Atmospheric assimilation of conventional observations perturbed by means of random samples of observation error yields estimates of the reanalysis uncertainty conditioned to observation errors. The data assimilation employed is a new scheme based on observation nudging that we denote ensemble nudging. The lower boundary of the atmosphere is regularly updated by external snow depth, sea surface temperature and soil moisture analyses. One of the most important purposes of reanalyses is the estimation of so-called essential climate variables. For regional reanalyses, precipitation has been identified as one of the essential climate variables that are potentially better represented than in other climate data sets. For that reason, we assess the representation of precipitation in our system in a pilot study. Based on two experiments, each of which extends over one month, we conduct a preliminary comparison to the global reanalysis ERAInterim, a dynamical downscaling of the latter and the high-resolution regional reanalysis COSMO-REA6. In a next step, we assess our reanalysis system's probabilistic capabilities versus the ECMWF-EPS in terms of sixhourly precipitation sums. The added value of our probabilistic regional reanalysis system motivates the current production of a 5-year-long test reanalysis COSMO-EN-REA12 in the framework of the FP7-funded project Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Re-Analyses (UERRA).},

abstract = {The Aral Sea located in Central Asia has undergone drastic changes in the last 50 years. This study quantitatively estimates the change in lake surface area since the 1970s and investigates how this change can affect local and regional near-surface air temperatures during the summer. LANDSAT satellite imagery shows more than 80{\%} reduction in lake surface area since the 1970s. Simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model show that this change in the lake surface can lead to a statistically significant warming of more than 6 °C in 2 m air temperatures over the dry lake bed and a significant warming signal of up to 1 °C covering an area up to 200 km around the original lake boundary, especially to the south. Observations in this region are sparse but still warming trends consistent with the simulations are seen in 2 m air temperatures from the Global Historical Climatology Network dataset. Atmospheric reanalysis and land cover data suggest that large-scale climate variability and land use change in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya basins contribute to the regional warming trends. Improvements in data and modeling capability are required to study the effects on diurnal and seasonal temperature cycle.},

abstract = {The water resources of the atolls of the Republic of Maldives are under continual threat from climatic and anthropogenic stresses, including land surface pollution, increasing population, drought, and sea-level rise (SLR). These threats are particularly acute for groundwater resources due to the small land surface area and low elevation of each island. In this study, the groundwater resources, in terms of freshwater lens thickness, total volume of fresh groundwater, and safe yield are estimated for the 52 most populous islands of the Maldives for current conditions and for the year 2030, with the latter accounting for projected SLR and associated shoreline recession. An algebraic model, designed in previous studies to estimate the lens thickness of atoll islands, is expanded in this study to also estimate volume of groundwater. Results indicate that average current lens thickness, groundwater volume, and per capita safe yield are approximately 4.6 m, 1,300 million liters, and 300 l/day, and that these values will decrease by approximately 10, 11, and 34{\%}, respectively, by the year 2030. Based on results, it is demonstrated that groundwater, in terms of quantity, is a viable source of water for the islands of the Maldives both now and in coming decades, particularly for islands with large surface area and low population. Study results can provide water resource managers and government officials with valuable data for consideration in water security measures. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Water Resources Association.},

abstract = {Fresh groundwater reserves on small coral islands are under continual threat of salinization and contamination because of droughts, storm-surge overwash events, over-extraction, island community urbanization, and sea level rise. Whereas storm-surge overwash events can cause sudden groundwater salinization, long-term changes in rainfall patterns and sea level elevation have the potential of rendering these islands uninhabitable in the coming decades. This study demonstrates the use of a tested freshwater lens thickness simulator to estimate the groundwater resources of a set of atoll islands in the coming decades. The method uses ranges of projected rates of annual rainfall and sea level rise (SLR) to provide a range of probable lens thickness for each island. Projected rainfall is provided by General Circulation Models that accurately replicate the historical rainfall patterns in the geographic region of the islands. Methodology is applied to 68 atoll islands in the Federated States of Micronesia. These islands have widths that range between 150 and 1000 m, and experience annual rainfall rates of between 2.8 and 4.8 m. Results indicate that under average conditions of SLR, beach slope, and rainfall, almost half of the island will experience a 20{\%} decrease in lens thickness by the year 2050. For worst-case scenarios (high SLR, low rainfall), average decrease in lens thickness is 55{\%}, with almost half of the islands experiencing a decrease of greater than 75{\%} and half of the islands having a lens thickness less than 1.0 m. Small islands (widths less than 400 m) are particularly vulnerable because of shoreline recession. Groundwater on islands in the western region is less vulnerable to SLR because of a projected increase in rainfall during the coming decades. Results indicate the vulnerability of small islands to changing climatic conditions, and can be used for water resources management and community planning. Methodology can be applied to any group of islands as a first approximation of the effect of future climate conditions on groundwater resources.

Design/methodology/approach. The research of features and changes of the thermal regime, the characteristics of its extreme was conducted for the period of 1981–2010 using daily data about average, minimum and maximum surface temperature from the 187 meteorological stations across the Ukraine. According to the daily observations data was calculated the characteristics of thermal regime: average, minimum and maximum per year and season air temperature, the number of warm, summer and hot days, tropical nights, frost days and days with frost below -10 ° C and -20 ° C, number of days, favourable for vegetation and days requiring heating, the maximum duration of the hot period and period of extreme cold. For each meteorological parameter the current climatic norm (1981–2010), rate and direction of changes, its significance and reliability was determined for all regions of Ukraine and the country as a whole. The reliability of the change was evaluated according to Student's t-test. F indings. The article considers the character traits of thermal regime in Ukraine in the current climatic period (1981–2010) and its features relative to the basic climatic period (1961–1990). The trends of change in long-term values of average and extreme characteristics of thermal regime at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries are specified. The conducted analyses revealed that in 1981–2010 climatic norms for main parameters of thermal regime have risen against values for the basic climatic period (1961–1990) due to significant increasing of air temperature. It was discovered that the air temperature in Ukraine increased throughout the year at a much faster pace than global. Such changes in winter season led to a decrease of the cold period duration, the number of cool days and the number of days requiring heating. In the warm period, there is a tendency to increase the duration of the warm and summer periods and the period of vegetation, the number of hot days and the duration of the hot period. These changes have regional peculiarities and increase from south to north. There is dependence between the anomalies of the average annual air temperature and anomalies of the climatic parameters of the thermal regime. It was found that an increase in the average annual temperature on 1 ° С leads to an increase in the duration of warm and vegetative periods in Ukraine for 6–7 days per 10 years and the number of summer days for 4 days per 10 years. The growth of the average summer temperature on 1 ° C causes an increase in the number of hot days for 8 days per 10 years. These dependencies also have regional features. Practical value/implications. The identified regional features of the thermal regime in Ukraine and their changes must be taken into account in the production activities of the climate-dependent industries of the country's economy, above all in those regions where their probability is greatest. The results can be used for assessment of the socio-ecological and socio-economic impacts of climate change and climatic projections constructing for different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and community development},

A total of 23 simulations run with a horizontal grid spacing of {\$}{\$}$\backslash$sim {\$}{\$} ∼ 3 km, driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis, and performed by 22 European research groups are analysed. Six different regional climate models (RCMs) are represented in the ensemble. The simulations are compared against available high-resolution precipitation observations and coarse resolution ( {\$}{\$}$\backslash$sim {\$}{\$} ∼ 12 km) RCMs with parameterized convection. The model simulations and observations are compared with respect to mean precipitation, precipitation intensity and frequency, and heavy precipitation on daily and hourly timescales in different seasons. The results show that kilometer-scale models produce a more realistic representation of precipitation than the coarse resolution RCMs. The most significant improvements are found for heavy precipitation and precipitation frequency on both daily and hourly time scales in the summer season. In general, kilometer-scale models tend to produce more intense precipitation and reduced wet-hour frequency compared to coarse resolution models. On average, the multi-model mean shows a reduction of bias from {\$}{\$}$\backslash$sim $\backslash$,{\$}{\$} ∼ −40{\%} at 12 km to {\$}{\$}$\backslash$sim $\backslash$,{\$}{\$} ∼ −3{\%} at 3 km for heavy hourly precipitation in summer. Furthermore, the uncertainty ranges i.e. the variability between the models for wet hour frequency is reduced by half with the use of kilometer-scale models. Although differences between the model simulations at the kilometer-scale and observations still exist, it is evident that these simulations are superior to the coarse-resolution RCM simulations in the representing precipitation in the present-day climate, and thus offer a promising way forward for investigations of climate and climate change at local to regional scales.},

abstract = {Groundwater resources of small coral islands are threatened due to short-term and long-term changes in climate. A significant short-term threat is El Ni{\~{n}}o events, which typically induce a severe months-long drought for many atoll nations in the western and central Pacific regions that exhausts rainwater supply and necessitates the use of groundwater. This study quantifies fresh groundwater resources under both average rainfall and drought conditions for the Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI), a nation composed solely of atolls and which is severely impacted by El Ni{\~{n}}o droughts. The atoll island algebraic model is used to estimate the thickness of the freshwater lens for 680 inhabited and uninhabited islands of the RMI, with a focus on the severe 1998 drought. The model accounts for precipitation, island width, hydraulic conductivity of the upper Holocene-age sand aquifer, the depth to the contact between the Holocene aquifer and the lower Pleistocene-age limestone aquifer, and the presence of a reef flat plate underlying the ocean side of the island. Model results are tested for islands that have fresh groundwater data. Results highlight the fragility of groundwater resources for the nation. Average lens thickness during typical seasonal rainfall is approximately 4 m, with only 30{\%} of the islands maintaining a lens thicker than 4.5{\%} and 55{\%} of the islands with a lens less than 2.5 m thick. Thicker lenses typically occur for larger islands, islands located on the leeward side of an atoll due to lower hydraulic conductivity, and islands located in the southern region of the RMI due to higher rainfall rates. During drought, groundwater on small islands ({\textless}300 m in width) is completely depleted. Over half (54{\%}) of the islands are classified as "Highly Vulnerable" to drought. Results provide valuable information for RMI water resources planners, particularly during the current 2016 El Ni{\~{n}}o drought, and similar methods can be used to quantify groundwater availability for other atoll island nations, including the Federated State of Micronesia, Republic of Maldives, and Republic of Kiribati. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.},

abstract = {We examine the possibility that anthropogenic forcing (Greenhouse gases and Sulfate aerosols, GS) is a plausible explanation for the observed near-surface temperature trends over the Mediterranean area. For this purpose, we compare annual and seasonal observed trends in near-surface temperature over the period from 1980 to 2009 with the response to GS forcing estimated from 23 models derived from CMIP3 database. We find that there is less than a 5{\%} chance that natural (internal) variability is responsible for the observed annual and seasonal area-mean warming except in winter. Using additionally two pattern similarity statistics, pattern correlation and regression, we find that the large-scale component (spatial-mean) of the GS signal is detectable (at 2. 5{\%} level) in all seasons except in winter. In contrast, we fail to detect the small-scale component (spatial anomalies about the mean) of GS signal in observed trend patterns. Further, we find that the recent trends are significantly (at 2. 5{\%} level) consistent with all the 23 GS patterns, except in summer and spring, when 9 and 5 models respectively underestimate the observed warming. Thus, we conclude that GS forcing is a plausible explanation for the observed warming in the Mediterranean region. Consistency of observed trends with climate change projections indicates that present trends may be understood of what will come more so in the future, allowing for a better communication of the societal challenges to meet in the future. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {This study addresses a need to document changes in streamflow and base flow (groundwater discharge to streams) in Hawai‘i during the past century. Statistically significant long‐term (1913–2008) downward trends were detected (using the nonparametric Mann–Kendall test) in low‐streamflow and base‐flow records. These long‐term downward trends are likely related to a statistically significant downward shift around 1943 detected (using the nonparametric Pettitt test) in index records of streamflow and base flow. The downward shift corresponds to a decrease of 22{\%} in median streamflow and a decrease of 23{\%} in median base flow between the periods 1913–1943 and 1943–2008. The shift coincides with other local and regional factors, including a change from a positive to a negative phase in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, shifts in the direction of the trade winds over Hawai‘i, and a reforestation programme. The detected shift and long‐term trends reflect region‐wide changes in climatic and land‐cover factors. A weak pattern of downward trends in base flows during the period 1943–2008 may indicate a continued decrease in base flows after the 1943 shift. Downward trends were detected more commonly in base‐flow records than in high‐streamflow, peak‐flow, and rainfall records. The decrease in base flow is likely related to a decrease in groundwater storage and recharge and therefore is a valuable indicator of decreasing water availability and watershed vulnerability to hydrologic changes. Whether the downward trends will continue is largely uncertain given the uncertainty in climate‐change projections and watershed responses to changes.},

abstract = {Owing to increase in snowfall, the Antarctic Ice Sheet surface mass balance is expected to increase by the end of the current century. Assuming no associated response of ice dynamics, this will be a negative contribution to sea-level rise. However, the assessment of these changes using dynamical downscaling of coupled climate model projections still bears considerable uncertainties due to poorly represented high-southern-latitude atmospheric circulation and sea surface conditions (SSCs), that is sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration. This study evaluates the Antarctic surface climate simulated using a global high-resolution atmospheric model and assesses the effects on the simulated Antarctic surface climate of two different SSC data sets obtained from two coupled climate model projections. The two coupled models from which SSCs are taken, MIROC-ESM and NorESM1-M, simulate future Antarctic sea ice trends at the opposite ends of the CMIP5 RCP8.5 projection range. The atmospheric model ARPEGE is used with a stretched grid configuration in order to achieve an average horizontal resolution of 35 km over Antarctica. Over the 1981-2010 period, ARPEGE is driven by the SSCs from MIROC-ESM, NorESM1-M and CMIP5 historical runs and by observed SSCs. These three simulations are evaluated against the ERA-Interim reanalyses for atmospheric general circulation as well as the MAR regional climate model and in situ observations for surface climate. For the late 21st century, SSCs from the same coupled climate models forced by the RCP8.5 emission scenario are used both directly and bias-corrected with an anomaly method which consists in adding the future climate anomaly from coupled model projections to the observed SSCs with taking into account the quantile distribution of these anomalies. We evaluate the effects of driving the atmospheric model by the bias-corrected instead of the original SSCs. For the simulation using SSCs from NorESM1-M, no significantly different climate change signals over Antarctica as a whole are found when bias-corrected SSCs are used. For the simulation driven by MIROC-ESM SSCs, a significant additional increase in precipitation and in winter temperatures for the Antarctic Ice Sheet is obtained when using bias-corrected SSCs. For the range of Antarctic warming found (C 3 to C4 K), we confirm that snowfall increase will largely outweigh increases in melt and rainfall. Using the end members of sea ice trends from the CMIP5 RCP8.5 projections, the difference in warming obtained ({\~{}} 1 K) is much smaller than the spread of the CMIP5 Antarctic warming projections. This confirms that the errors in representing the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation in climate models are also determinant for the diversity of their projected late 21st century Antarctic climate change.},

abstract = {Temperature and precipitation in situ datasets for the Caribbean island, Trinidad for 1961--2010 were statistically analyzed using the RClimDex software and the Mann-Kendall test for trends. The annual, seasonal, and monthly findings were compared with regional projections; Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies (PRECIS) and a 20 km atmospheric global circulation model, and a global projection of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3). Overall, the seasonal and decadal results revealed patterns different from the annual warming. All the temperature indices were found to have warming patterns with the wet season, June to December, generally greater than the dry season, January to May. The warmest decade was 1980s, whereas globally, the decade 2001--2010 was the warmest. There was an increase in the annual maximum 5 day precipitation, RX5day, at the UWI station. During the dry season (1973--2010) at the UFS and UWI stations, the RX5day increased by 8.60 and 7.76 mm per decade, respectively, while the maximum 1-day precipitation, RX1day, increased by 2.92 and 8.90 mm per decade for the UFS and UWI, respectively. The 1980s was the wettest, and during the decade 2001--2010, there were above averages for the consecutive dry days (CDD) and the simple daily intensity index (SDII). The projections on both the regional and global outlooks suggest that this warming pattern will continue in the future. This small-scale study supports that seasonal and decadal analyses, in addition to the annual assessments, are significant for the understanding of the climate variability which is required for vulnerability and adaptation studies for small island states.},

abstract = {Despite decades of donor support for the water sector, many small island developing states (SIDS) have failed to make acceptable levels of progress toward achievement of water‐related millennium development goals and reduction of water‐related risks. At least three distinct policy paradigms have at different times been regarded as best practice for responding to water insecurity throughout the world. Yet, while the water management literature points to the need for a paradigm shift toward improved governance approaches, there has been little critical examination of whether the assumptions implicit within these theoretical paradigms are applicable to SIDS contexts. This study reviews the water management, governance, and island studies literatures to identify the ways in which the unique historical, geographical, and economic contexts of SIDS limit or enable the applicability of these paradigms. The analysis shows that each paradigm has a different underlying conceptualization of governance, and how institutions can regulate social–ecological relations for achieving water security. The conceptualizations of governance under the adaptive management paradigm seem to most closely reflect the complexity of governance in SIDS, and may therefore hold the most potential for addressing water insecurity. However, the analysis also highlights the need for further research to test the application of adaptive management in a way that can also cater for the unique socio‐political relations that affect the outcomes of governance in SIDS.},

abstract = {Hydrological forecasting systems require accurate initial conditions, particularly for real time precipitation data, which are problematic to retrieve. This is especially difficult for high temporal and spatial resolutions, e.g. sub-daily and less than 10–20km. Forecasting fast processes such as flash flood are, however, dependent on such high resolution data. Gridded gauge data produces too smooth fields and underestimates small scale phenomena, such as convection, whereas radar composites contain the small scale information, but suffer from inconsistencies between individual radars and have poor long term statistics. Here, we present a method to merge a radar composite with daily resolution gridded gauge data for Sweden for the time period 2009–2014 to produce a one hourly 4×4km2 data set. The method consists of a main step where monthly accumulations of the radar data are scaled by those retrieved from the gridded data for each month. An optional quantile mapping based bias correction step makes sure that the daily intensity distribution agrees with the gridded observations. Finally, the data are dis-aggregated to an hourly time resolution. This results in a data set which has the same long-term spatial properties as the gridded observations, but with the spatial and temporal details of the radar data. Validation of the method is performed with high resolution gauge data, and shows a high quality of the derived product.},

abstract = {The Flagship Pilot Study in southeastern South America (FPS-SESA) endorsed by the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiments (CORDEX) program seeks to promote inter-institutional collaboration and further networking with focus on extreme rainfall events. The main scientific aim is to study multi-scale processes and interactions most conducive to extreme events through both statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques, including convection-permitting simulations. To this end, a targeted experiment was designed considering the season October 2009 to March 2010, a season with a record number of extreme precipitation events within SESA. Also, three individual extreme events within that season were chosen as case studies for analyzing specific regional processes and sensitivity to resolutions. Four dynamical and four statistical downscaling models (RCM and ESD respectively) from different institutions contributed to the experiment. In this work, an analysis of the capability of the set of the FPS-SESA downscaling methods in simulating daily precipitation during the selected warm season is presented together with an integrated assessment of multiple sources of observations and available climate CORDEX simulations. Comparisons among all simulations reveal that there is no single model that performs best in all aspects evaluated. The ability in reproducing the different features of daily precipitation depends on the model. However, the evaluation of the sequence of precipitation events, their intensity and timing allows to suggest that FPS-SESA simulations based on both RCM and ESD yield promising results. Most models capture the extreme events selected, although with a considerable spread in accumulated values and the location of heavy precipitation.},

abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau has experienced substantial warming during the last few decades. As a result, the cryosphere of the Tibetan Plateau, including the snow cover, has shown significant changes. We characterized the changes in snow over the Tibetan Plateau using several snow-related indices, including snow depth and snow-covered days based on the MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalysis data set and passive microwave (MW) satellite observations. The analyses were performed over different time periods—including the last 38, 30, 20, and 10 snow seasons—from 1980 to 2018. The results show that the significant trends in snow depth and snow-covered days are dependent on both the season and region and vary with the data set and snow-related index used. There was a clear decrease in the annual maximum consecutive snow-covered days (CSCDMax), and this was characterized by a later begin time and an earlier end time for both MERRA-2 and JRA-55, but only a later begin time for MW during the time period 1980–2018. The changes in CSCDMax were generally dominated by changes in the begin time, which were mainly caused by the increase in the average 2-m air temperature for November–December. The relatively weak trends in the end time were a result of the combined impact of warmer temperatures and more precipitation in March–April. The CSCDMax averaged over the Tibetan Plateau showed decreasing trends in all studied time periods for JRA-55 and MW and in the last 38 and 10 snow seasons for MERRA-2 during the time period 1980–2018.},

abstract = {The simulations of the fifth Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) strengthen previous assessments of a substantial role of anthropogenic emissions in driving precipitation changes in the Sahel, the semiarid region at the southern edge of the Sahara. Historical simulations can capture the magnitude of the centennial Sahel drying over the span of the 20th century and confirm that anthropogenic forcings have contributed substantially to it. Yet, the models do not reproduce the amplitude of observed oscillations at multidecadal timescales, suggesting that either oscillations in the forcing or the strength of natural variability are underestimated. Projections for Sahel rainfall are less robust than the 20th century hindcast and outlier projections persist, but overall the CMIP5 models confirm the CMIP3 results in many details and reaffirm the prediction of a rainy season that is more feeble at its start, especially in West Africa, and more abundant at its core across the entire Sahel. Out of 20 models, four buck this consensus. Idealized simulations from a subset of the CMIP5 ensemble - simulations designed to separate the fast land-atmosphere response to increased greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the slow response mediated through changes in sea surface temperature (SST) - confirm that the direct effect of CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is to enhance the monsoon, while warmer SST induce drying over the Sahel. At the same time, these simulations suggest that the seasonal evolution of the rainfall trends in the scenario simulations, spring drying and fall wetting, is an inherently coupled response, not captured by the linear superposition of the fast and slow response to CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}.

abstract = {Sahel rainfall is dynamically linked to the global Hadley cell and to the regional monsoon circulation. It is therefore susceptible to forcings from remote oceans and regional land alike. Warming of the oceans enhances the stability of the tropical atmosphere and weakens deep ascent in the Hadley circulation. Warming of the Sahara and of the nearby oceans changes the structure and position of the regional shallow circulation and allows more of the intense convective systems that determine seasonal rain accumulation. These processes can explain the observed interannual to multidecadal variability. Sea surface temperature anomalies were the dominant forcing of the drought of the 1970s and 1980s. In most recent decades, seasonal rainfall amounts have partially recovered, but rainy season characteristics have changed: rainfall is more intense and intermittent and wetting is concentrated in the late rainy season and away from the west coast. Similar subseasonal and subregional differences in rainfall trends characterize the simulated response to increased greenhouse gases, suggesting an anthropogenic influence. While uncertainty in future projections remains, confidence in them is encouraged by the recognition that seasonal mean rainfall depends on large-scale drivers of atmospheric circulations that are well resolved by current climate models. Nevertheless, observational and modeling efforts are needed to provide more refined projections of rainfall changes, expanding beyond total accumulation to metrics of intraseasonal characteristics and risk of extreme events, and coordination between climate scientists and stakeholders is needed to generate relevant information that is useful even under deep uncertainty.

Here we use a state-of-the-art global climate model in idealized seasonal forcing simulations to show that Arctic warming (especially in winter) and sea ice decline are particularly sensitive to radiative forcing in spring, during which the energy is effectively ‘absorbed' by the ocean (through sea ice melt and ocean warming, amplified by the ice-albedo feedback) and consequently released to the lower atmosphere in autumn and winter, mainly along the sea ice periphery. In contrast, winter radiative forcing causes a more uniform response centered over the Arctic Ocean. This finding suggests that intermodel differences in simulated Arctic (winter) warming can to a considerable degree be attributed to model uncertainties in Arctic radiative fluxes, which peak in summer},

Equally important to trends in the mean climate are changes in interannual variability, but changes in precipitation fluctuations are highly uncertain and the associated processes are unknown. Here, we use various state-of-the-art global climate model simulations to show that interannual variability of Arctic precipitation will likely increase markedly (up to 40{\%} over the 21st century), especially in summer. This can be attributed to increased poleward atmospheric moisture transport variability associated with enhanced moisture content, possibly modulated by atmospheric dynamics. Because both the means and variability of Arctic precipitation will increase, years/seasons with excessive precipitation will occur more often, as will the associated impacts.},

abstract = {Climate models project a strong increase in Arctic precipitation over the coming century 1 , which has been attributed primarily to enhanced surface evaporation associated with sea-ice retreat 2. Since the Arctic is still quite cold, especially in winter, it is often (implicitly) assumed that the additional precipitation will fall mostly as snow 3. However, little is known about future changes in the distributions of rainfall and snowfall in the Arctic. Here we use 37 state-of-the-art climate models in standardized twenty-first-century (2006-2100) simulations 4 to show a decrease in average annual Arctic snowfall (70 •-90 • N), despite the strong precipitation increase. Rain is projected to become the dominant form of precipitation in the Arctic region (2091-2100), as atmospheric warming causes a greater fraction of snowfall to melt before it reaches the surface, in particular over the North Atlantic and the Barents Sea. The reduction in Arctic snowfall is most pronounced during summer and autumn when temperatures are close to the melting point, but also winter rainfall is found to intensify considerably. Projected (seasonal) trends in rainfall and snowfall will heavily impact Arctic hydrology (for example, river discharge, permafrost melt) 5-7 , climatology (for example, snow, sea-ice albedo and melt) 8,9 and ecology (for example, water and food availability) 5,10. Changes in surface evaporation, atmospheric water vapour content and moisture transports modulate precipitation rates. Globally, precipitation is projected to increase at only about 2{\%} per degree warming owing mainly to infrared radiation constraints 11. Regional precipitation changes, however, can diverge considerably from this global value. In the Arctic, for instance, precipitation rates have been shown to increase much faster than the global rate (4.5{\%} per degree) 2. This has been attributed primarily to sea-ice retreat, with open water allowing more evaporation, cloud formation and precipitation. Increased moisture transport from southerly latitudes was found to be of secondary importance, but both contributions (local and remote) exhibit considerable seasonal variations 2,12. In any case, projected increases in Arctic precipitation of over 50{\%} (model-mean value) during the coming century (see Supplementary Information) are conclusively linked to amplified Arctic warming 2. All current climate models depict an increase in Arctic precipitation (albeit at different magnitude), which can thus be regarded as a robust feature of projected climate change. Therefore, potentially broad and long-lasting impacts of increased Arctic precipitation on hydrology 13 , climate feedbacks 9 , ice-sheet mass balance and flow speed 14 , sea ice, ocean circulation 2 and biology/ecosystems 5 should be taken into consideration. The issue of increased Arctic precipitation and its possible consequences is complicated, however, by the fact that in cold regions such as the Arctic, precipitation can fall as either rain or snow, depending primarily on the ambient atmospheric temperature 6,9. With projected Arctic warming varying considerably with season (strong in winter, moderate in summer) 15 , the seasonally varying fraction of rain/snow will inevitably change as well. Whereas increased precipitation leads to more snowfall, higher atmospheric temperatures tend to reduce snowfall 16. Because of these opposing mechanisms, whose magnitude varies with location and season, it is a priori unclear whether Arctic warming will reduce or enhance total Arctic snowfall. In any case, a changing ratio of liquid to solid Arctic precipitation may have broad and wide-ranging consequences for: hydrology, as it governs the seasonality of snow cover 17 as well as snow melt and runoff 6 (thereby modulating Arctic Ocean salin-ity 2,18); climatology, for instance because it affects the surface reflec-tivity of snow-covered regions and of sea ice (snowfall increases the snow albedo, whereas rain will reduce the albedo by increasing the snow grain size 19 , and reinforce snowmelt), and because it reinforces ice-sheet melt rates and flow speeds 14 ; biology/ecosystems, since for instance winter rainfall and icing have been shown to inhibit reindeer food availability 10 , causing a dramatic population decline and associated strong fluctuations in the fragile Arctic ecosystem; economy, with more frequent icing conditions causing infrastructural and related problems 20. For these and other reasons, it is of vital importance to quantify future changes in Arctic precipitation in terms of the rain/snow fraction. Here we use output from 37 state-of-the-art global climate models within the framework of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercom-parison Project, phase 5) 4 to analyse projected seasonally varying trends in Arctic (70 •-90 • N) precipitation, including the subdivision between rainfall and snowfall. For this purpose we use standardized simulations for the period 2006-2100 based on intermediate and strong forcing scenarios 4 (see Methods). In the current climate (2006-2015), snowfall governs precipitation in the frigid central Arctic and in the high-elevation expanses of Greenland with 70 to 100{\%} of the annual precipitation falling as snow (Fig. 1a). The annual snowfall fraction, defined as the ratio of snowfall and total precipitation, drops to 40{\%} in the milder peripheral regions of the Arctic. Nevertheless, the majority of annual and total Arctic precipitation currently falls as snow 21. Towards the end of the twenty-first century (2091-2100), however, with Arctic precipitation rates increasing by 50 to 60{\%} (Supplementary Information), the simulated snowfall fraction reduces dramatically with only Greenland continuing to experience snowfall fractions over 80{\%} (Fig. 1b). In the central Arctic, the snowfall fraction barely remains larger than 50{\%}, and precipitation will be dominated by rainfall in much of the Arctic. The most dramatic reductions in snowfall fraction will occur over the North Atlantic and especially the Barents Sea (Fig. 1c) 22 , where most climate models project strong twenty-first-century surface warming (Supplementary Information). With Arctic warming causing a ubiquitous increase in precipitation as well as an overall decrease in snowfall fraction, the question is how, according to the climate models, these opposing effects translate into twenty-first-century trends in Arctic rainfall and snowfall.},

abstract = {Abstract One of the key components of Antarctica's harsh climate is its renowned katabatic winds, which are among the fiercest surface winds on Earth. Caused primarily by strong surface cooling over the sloping ice surface, these semipermanent winds result primarily from the strong surface temperature inversion and associated temperature deficit between the surface layer and the free atmosphere aloft. Katabatic winds exert a strong effect on the mass budget of the Antarctic ice sheet by affecting snowdrift (sublimation) and by (partially) regulating the net atmospheric moisture transports toward the Antarctic. It has been suggested that greenhouse warming may lead to reduced surface cooling and weakened katabatic winds. This is tested by using a global climate model (EC-Earth) in prescribed sea surface temperature simulations of the present-day (2002?2006) and future (2094?2098) climates. Because simulated topographically induced katabatic winds are likely to depend on the model grid, we employ two model resolutions: (1) T159L62 ({\~{}}100?km, 62 vertical levels) and (2) T799L91 ({\~{}}20?km, 91 vertical levels). It is shown here that present-day surface winds over Antarctica in high resolution are generally stronger than in low resolution, especially in the escarpment region with its steep orography. Simulated surface winds are generally underestimated with respect to observations, in particular the strongest winds (occurring over steep slopes), and especially in low resolution. The seasonal cycle in surface winds is simulated fairly accurately. Surface temperatures are also relatively well simulated (when corrected for elevation differences), especially in high resolution.},

However, it remains unclear whether these observed links are causal, and model experiments suggest that they might not be. Here we apply two independent approaches to infer causality from observations and climate models and to reconcile these sources of data. Models capture the observed correlations between reduced sea ice and cold mid-latitude winters, but only when reduced sea ice coincides with anomalous heat transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, implying that the atmosphere is driving the loss. Causal inference from the physics-based approach is corroborated by a lead–lag analysis, showing that circulation-driven temperature anomalies precede, but do not follow, reduced sea ice. Furthermore, no mid-latitude cooling is found in modelling experiments with imposed future sea-ice loss. Our results show robust support for anomalous atmospheric circulation simultaneously driving cold mid-latitude winters and mild Arctic conditions, and reduced sea ice having a minimal influence on severe mid-latitude winters.},

abstract = {Past studies have concluded that climate models of previous generations tended to underestimate the large warming trend that has been observed in summer over western Europe in the last few decades. The causes of this systematic error are still not clear. Here, we investigate this issue with a new generation of climate models and systematically explore the role of large-scale circulation in that context. As an ensemble, climate models in this study warm less over western Europe and warm more over eastern Europe than observed on the 1951-2014 period, but it is difficult to conclude this is directly due to systematic errors given the large potential impact of internal variability. These differences in temperature trends are explained to an important extent by an anti-correlation of sea level pressure trends over the North Atlantic / Europe domain between models and observations. The observed trend tends to warm (cool) western (eastern) Europe but the simulated trends generally have the opposite effect, both in new generation and past generation climate models. The differences between observed and simulated sea level pressure trends are likely the result of systematic model errors, which might also impact future climate projections. Neither a higher resolution nor the realistic representation of the evolution of sea surface temperature and sea ice leads to a better simulation of sea level pressure trends.},

We show that important discrepancies at large-scales exist between global and regional projections. The RCMs project at the end of the 21st century over a large area of Europe a summer warming 1.5–2 K colder, and a much smaller decrease of precipitation of 5{\%}, versus 20{\%} in their driving GCMs. The RCMs generally simulate a much smaller increase in shortwave radiation at surface, which directly impacts surface temperature. In addition to differences in cloud cover changes, the absence of time-varying anthropogenic aerosols in most regional simulations plays a major role in the differences of solar radiation changes. We confirm this result with twin regional simulations with and without time-varying anthropogenic aerosols. Additionally, the RCMs simulate larger increases in evapotranspiration over the Mediterranean sea and larger increases/smaller decreases over land, which contribute to smaller changes in relative humidity, with likely impacts on clouds and precipitation changes. Several potential causes of these differences in evapotranspiration changes are discussed. Overall, this work suggests that the current EURO-CORDEX RCM ensemble does not capture the upper part of the climate change uncertainty range, with important implications for impact studies and the adaptation policies that they inform.},

New evidence of a multi-decadal drying trend and the impacts of a persistent drought that since 2010 has affected several regions of the country, reinforce the need for clear diagnoses of the hydro-climate changes in Chile. Based on the analysis of long-term records (50+ years) of precipitation and streamflow, we confirm a tendency toward a dryer condition in central-southern Chile (30–48°S). We describe the geographical and seasonal character of this trend, as well as the associated large-scale circulation patterns. When a large ensemble of climate model simulations is contrasted to observations, anthropogenic forcing appears as the leading factor of precipitation change. In addition to a drying trend driven by greenhouse gas forcing in all seasons, our results indicate that the Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion has played a major role in the summer rainfall decline. Although average model results agree well with the drying trend's seasonal character, the observed change magnitude is two to three times larger than that simulated, indicating a potential underestimation of future projections for this region. Under present-day carbon emission rates, the drying pathway in Chile will likely prevail during the next decades, although the summer signal should weaken as a result of the gradual ozone layer recovery. The trends and scenarios shown here pose substantial stress on Chilean society and its institutions, and call for urgent action regarding adaptation measures.},

Precipitation controls the snow cover on sea ice, which impedes the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere, inhibiting sea ice growth. Thus accurate precipitation amounts are needed to inform sea ice modeling, especially for production of thickness estimates from satellite altimetry freeboard data. However, obtaining a quantitative estimate of the precipitation distribution in the Arctic is notoriously difficult due to a number of factors including: a lack of reliable, long-term in situ observations, difficulties in remote sensing over sea ice, and model biases in temperature and moisture fields and associated uncertainty of modeled cloud microphysical processes in the polar regions.

abstract = {Atmospheric reanalyses covering the European region are mainly available as part of relatively coarse global reanalyses. The aim of this article is to present the development and evaluation of a next generation regional reanalysis for the European CORDEX EUR-11 domain with a horizontal grid spacing of approximately 6 km. In this context, a reanalysis is understood to be an assimilation of heterogeneous observations with a physical model such as a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. The reanalysis system presented here is based on the NWP model COSMO by the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst) using a continuous nudging scheme. In order to assess the added value of data assimilation, a dynamical downscaling experiment has been conducted, i.e. an identical model set-up but without data assimilation. Both systems have been evaluated for a 1 year test period, employing standard measures such as analysis increments, biases, or log-odds ratios, as well as tests for distributional characteristics. An important aspect is the evaluation from different perspectives and with independent measurements such as satellite infrared brightness temperatures using forward operators, integrated water vapour from GPS stations, and ceilometer cloud cover. It can be shown that the reanalysis better resolves local extreme events; this is basically an effect of the higher spatio-temporal resolution, as known from dynamical downscaling approaches. However, an important criterion for regional reanalyses is the coherence with independent observations of high temporal and spatial resolution, resulting in significant improvement over dynamical downscaling. The system is intended to become operational within a year, continuously reprocessing and evaluating longer time periods. The reanalysis data are planned to become available to the research community within a year.

abstract = {A record-setting temperature of 17.5°C occurred on 24 March 2015 at the Esperanza station located near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). We studied the event using surface station data, satellite imagery, reanalysis data, and numerical simulations. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Antarctic Ice Shelf Image Archive provides clear evidence for disintegration and advection of sea ice, as well as the formation of melt ponds on the ice sheet surface at the base of the AP mountain range. A deep low-pressure center over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea and a blocking ridge over the southeast Pacific provided favorable conditions for the development of an atmospheric river with a northwest-southeast orientation, directing warm and moist air toward the AP, and triggering a widespread foehn episode. A control simulation using a regional climate model shows the existence of local topographically induced warming along the northern tip of the AP (∼60{\%} of the full temperature signal) and the central part of the eastern AP (90{\%} of the full temperature signal) with respect to a simulation without topography. These modeling results suggest that more than half of the warming experienced at Esperanza can be attributed to the foehn effect (a local process), rather than to the large-scale advection of warm air from the midlatitudes. Nevertheless, the local foehn effect also has a large-scale advection component, since the atmospheric river provides water vapor for orographic precipitation enhancement and latent heat release, which makes it difficult to completely disentangle the role of local versus large-scale processes in explaining the extreme event.},

abstract = {This study investigates the recent near-surface temperature trends over the Antarctic Peninsula. We make use of available surface observations, ECMWF's ERA5 and its predecessor ERA-Interim, as well as numerical simulations, allowing us to contrast different data sources. We use hindcast simulations performed with Polar-WRF over the Antarctic Peninsula on a nested domain configuration at 45 km (PWRF-45) and 15 km (PWRF-15) spatial resolutions for the period 1991-2015. In addition, we include hindcast simulations of KNMI-RACMO21P obtained from the CORDEX-Antarctica domain ({\~{}}50 km) for further comparisons. Results show that there is a marked windward warming trend except during summer. This windward warming trend is particularly notable in the autumn season and likely to be associated with the recent deepening of the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea low and warm advection towards the Antarctic Peninsula. On the other hand, an overall summer cooling is characterized by the strengthening of the Weddell Sea low as well as an anticyclonic trend over the Amundsen Sea accompanied by northward winds. The persistent cooling trend observed at the Larsen Ice Shelf station is not captured by ERA-Interim, whereas hindcast simulations indicate that there is a clear pattern of windward warming and leeward cooling. Furthermore, larger temporal correlations and lower differences exhibited by PWRF-15 illustrate the existence of the added value in the higher spatial resolution simulation.},

abstract = {This study examines the projections of hydroclimatic regimes and extremes over Andean basins in central Chile (∼ 30–40° S) under a low and high emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively). A gridded daily precipitation and temperature dataset based on observations is used to drive and validate the VIC macro-scale hydrological model in the region of interest. Historical and future simulations from 19 climate models participating in CMIP5 have been adjusted with the observational dataset and then used to make hydrological projections. By the end of the century, there is a large difference between the scenarios, with projected warming of ∼ + 1.2 °C (RCP2.6), ∼ + 3.5 °C (RCP8.5) and drying of ∼ − 3{\%} (RCP2.6), ∼ − 30{\%} (RCP8.5). Following the strong drying and warming projected in this region under the RCP8.5 scenario, the VIC model simulates decreases in annual runoff of about 40{\%} by the end of the century. Such strong regional effect of climate change may have large implications for the water resources of this region. Even under the low emission scenario, the Andes snowpack is projected to decrease by 35–45{\%} by mid-century. In more snowmelt-dominated areas, the projected hydrological changes under RCP8.5 go together with more loss in the snowpack (75–85{\%}) and a temporal shift in the center timing of runoff to earlier dates (up to 5 weeks by the end of the century). The severity and frequency of extreme hydroclimatic events are also projected to increase in the future. The occurrence of extended droughts, such as the recently experienced mega-drought (2010–2015), increases from one to up to five events per 100 years under RCP8.5. Concurrently, probability density function of 3-day peak runoff indicates an increase in the frequency of flood events. The estimated return periods of 3-day peak runoff events depict more drastic changes and increase in the flood risk as higher recurrence intervals are considered by mid-century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, and by the end of the century under RCP8.5.},

This study explores the impacts of these biases on multimodel uncertainty in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble projections of 21st century change in Antarctic surface temperature, net precipitation, and SIA. The analysis is based on time slice climatologies in the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 future scenario (2070-2099) and historical (1970-1999) simulations across 37 different CMIP5 models. Projected changes in net precipitation, temperature, and SIA are found to be strongly associated with simulated historical mean SIA (e.g., cross-model correlations of r = 0.77, 0.71, and -0.85, respectively). Furthermore, historical SIA bias is found to have a large impact on the simulated ratio between net precipitation response and temperature response. This ratio is smaller in models with smaller-than-observed SIA. These strong emergent relationships on SIA bias could, if found to be physically robust, be exploited to give more precise climate projections for Antarctica.},

abstract = {Two decades into the 21st century there is growing evidence for global impacts of Antarctic and Southern Ocean climate change. Reliable estimates of how the Antarctic climate system would behave under a range of scenarios of future external climate forcing are thus a high priority. Output from new model simulations coordinated as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) provides an opportunity for a comprehensive analysis of the latest generation of state-of-the-art climate models following a wider range of experiment types and scenarios than previous CMIP phases. Here the main broad-scale 21st century Antarctic projections provided by the CMIP6 models are shown across four forcing scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. End-of-century Antarctic surface-air temperature change across these scenarios (relative to 1995–2014) is 1.3, 2.5, 3.7 and 4.8°C. The corresponding proportional precipitation rate changes are 8, 16, 24 and 31{\%}. In addition to these end-of-century changes, an assessment of scenario dependence of pathways of absolute and global-relative 21st century projections is conducted. Potential differences in regional response are of particular relevance to coastal Antarctica, where, for example, ecosystems and ice shelves are highly sensitive to the timing of crossing of key thresholds in both atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Overall, it is found that the projected changes over coastal Antarctica do not scale linearly with global forcing. We identify two factors that appear to contribute: (a) a stronger global-relative Southern Ocean warming in stabilisation (SSP2-4.5) and aggressive mitigation (SSP1-2.6) scenarios as the Southern Ocean continues to warm and (b) projected recovery of Southern Hemisphere stratospheric ozone and its effect on the mid-latitude westerlies. The major implication is that over coastal Antarctica, the surface warming by 2100 is stronger relative to the global mean surface warming for the low forcing compared to high forcing future scenarios.},

Evaluation of the reliability of climate model projections involves many lines of evidence on past performance combined with knowledge of the processes that need to be represented. Routine model evaluation is mainly based on the modern observational period, which started with the establishment of a network of Antarctic weather stations in 1957/58. This period is too short to evaluate many fundamental aspects of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean climate system, such as decadal-to-century time-scale climate variability and trends. To help address this gap, we present a new evaluation of potential ways in which long-term observational and paleo-proxy reconstructions may be used, with a particular focus on improving projections. A wide range of data sources and time periods is included, ranging from ship observations of the early 20th century to ice core records spanning hundreds to hundreds of thousands of years to sediment records dating back 34 million years. We conclude that paleo-proxy records and long-term observational datasets are an underused resource in terms of strategies for improving Antarctic climate projections for the 21st century and beyond. We identify priorities and suggest next steps to addressing this.},

abstract = {AbstractBy the end of the century, climate projections for southern Europe exhibit an enhanced near-surface summer warming in response to greenhouse gas emissions, which is known as the Mediterranean amplification. Possible causes for this amplified warming signal include a poleward Hadley cell expansion as well as tropospheric lapse-rate changes. In this work, regional climate model (RCM) simulations driven by three different global climate models (GCMs) are performed, representing the RCP8.5 emission scenario. For every downscaled GCM, the climate change signal over Europe is separated into five contributions by modifying the lateral boundary conditions of the RCM. This simulation strategy is related to the pseudo–global warming method. The results show that a poleward expansion of the Hadley cell is of minor importance for the Mediterranean amplification. During summer, the simulated Hadley circulation is weak, and projections show no distinct expansion in the European sector. The north–south contrast ...},

abstract = {There is clear evidence that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is contributing to sea-level rise. In contrast, West Antarctic temperature changes in recent decades remain uncertain. West Antarctica has probably warmed since the 1950s, but there is disagreement regarding the magnitude, seasonality and spatial extent of this warming. This is primarily because long-term near-surface temperature observations are restricted to Byrd Station in central West Antarctica, a data set with substantial gaps. Here, we present a complete temperature record for Byrd Station, in which observations have been corrected, and gaps have been filled using global reanalysis data and spatial interpolation. The record reveals a linear increase in annual temperature between 1958 and 2010 by 2.4±1.2 °C, establishing central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions globally. We confirm previous reports of West Antarctic warming, in annual average and in austral spring and winter, but find substantially larger temperature increases. In contrast to previous studies, we report statistically significant warming during austral summer, particularly in December–January, the peak of the melting season. A continued rise in summer temperatures could lead to more frequent and extensive episodes of surface melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. These results argue for a robust long-term meteorological observation network in the region.},

To evaluate changes in Asian-Australian monsoon wet season rainfall, daily data from historical and future (Representative Concentration Pathway “RCP8.5”) climate simulations are band pass-filtered to isolate variability on near-daily, weekly, monthly, intraseasonal, annual, interannual, and decadal time scales. This method is used to quantify changes in variability from 35 coupled climate models for each time scale over the Australian, South Asian, and East Asian monsoon domains. In nearly all cases, the median model change is positive, indicating increased rainfall variability, although with large model spread. The role of increased atmospheric moisture is examined by estimating the change due to an idealized thermodynamic enhancement. This enhancement produces increases in variability that are within the range of the simulated changes under the RCP8.5 scenario, indicating that thermodynamic responses provide a first-order explanation for the increased daily to decadal monsoon rainfall variability.},

abstract = {In situ observations of snow water equivalent (SWE) from manual snow surveys and automated sensors are made at approximately 1000 sites across Canada in support of water resource planning for flood control and hydroelectricity production. These data represent an important source of information for research (e.g., validation of hydrological and climate models), for applied studies (e.g., ground snow loads), and for climate monitoring. This note describes the process to update a Canadian historical snow survey dataset to 2016 and the production of a 0.1° gridded version for research applications. Analysis of trends in SWE, snow depth (SD), and density over the 50-year period from 1967 to 2016 revealed large spatial variability in trend sign and strength, with a relatively small percentage of points showing statistically significant trends. Where SWE and SD trends were significant, they tended to be negative, which is consistent with previous investigations of snow cover changes in Canada. The results show evidence of a latitudinal dependence in SWE trends, with the largest negative trends occurring over lower latitudes, and a tendency for mainly positive trends in Arctic SWE, which is consistent with observations from Russia and climate model projections of the response of Arctic snow cover to climate warming. Arctic sites also showed evidence of an increasing trend in 1 April snowpack density of 6.6 kg m−3 per decade but little corresponding change in SD. This has potentially important consequences for the soil thermal regime because it provides a cooling influence from an increase in the snowpack effective thermal conductivity.

abstract = {The Italian monthly temperature (mean, maximum and minimum) and precipitation secular data set was updated and completely revised. Station density and metadata availability were greatly improved and the series were subjected to a detailed quality control and homogenisation procedure. The data homogenisation is described in detail. The bias affecting original data is quantified by studying the temporal evolution of the mean adjustments applied to the series and examined in the light of the stations history. The results stress the importance of homogenisation in climate change studies. The final data set was cluste red into climatically homogeneous regions by means of a Principal Component Analysis. Yearly and seasonal trend analyses were performed both on regional average series and on the mean Italian series. The results highlight a positive trend for mean temperature of about 1 K per century all over Italy; it is generally higher for minimum temperature than for the maximum temperature. The progressive application of trend analysis shows that, in the last 50 years, behaviour is the opposite; the maximum temperature trend being stronger than that of the minimum temperature. This has led to a negative trend in the daily temperature range that for the last 50 years has become positive. Precipitation shows a decreasing tendency, even if low and rarely significant, the negative trend being only 5{\%} per century on a yearly basis.

abstract = {The results of a sensitivity work based on ERA-Interim driven COSMO-CLM simulations over the Middle East-North Africa (CORDEX-MENA) domain are presented. All simulations were performed at 0.44° spatial resolution. The purpose of this study was to ascertain model performances with respect to changes in physical and tuning parameters which are mainly related to surface, convection, radiation and cloud parameterizations. Evaluation was performed for the whole CORDEX-MENA region and six sub-regions, comparing a set of 26 COSMO-CLM runs against a combination of available ground observations, satellite products and reanalysis data to assess temperature, precipitation, cloud cover and mean sea level pressure. The model proved to be very sensitive to changes in physical parameters. The optimized configuration allows COSMO-CLM to improve the simulated main climate features of this area. Its main characteristics consist in the new parameterization of albedo, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, and the new parameterization of aerosol, based on NASA-GISS AOD distributions. When applying this configuration, Mean Absolute Error values for the considered variables are as follows: about 1.2 °C for temperature, about 15 mm/month for precipitation, about 9 {\%} for total cloud cover, and about 0.6 hPa for mean sea level pressure.},

Two simulations with the COSMO-CLM model have been conducted respectively, at a spatial resolution of 0.44° and 0.22° over the period 1979–2100, employing the IPCC RCP4.5 scenario. Initial and boundary conditions have been derived by the global model CMCC-CM. The main aim of the work is to provide regional climate projections for this area, widening the range of the data already available, yet with higher resolution, useful for many applications, especially as an input for the impact models. The two different resolutions have been employed in order to quantify the differences due to the spatial scale effects, comparing the results also with the driving global model. Climate projections show a significant warming expected over the whole area considered at the end of the 21st century, along with a reduction in precipitation, which is particularly evident over the western part of the domain. Precipitation projections depend on the horizontal resolution, suggesting the need for additional simulations at higher resolution, especially for a proper representation of extreme weather events.},

abstract = {This study presents climate change results from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) suite of dynamically downscaled simulations for the North American monsoon system in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The focus is on changes in precipitation and the processes driving the projected changes from the regional climate simulations and their driving coupled atmosphere–ocean global climate models. The effect of known biases on the projections is also examined. Overall, there is strong ensemble agreement for a large decrease in precipitation during the monsoon season; however, this agreement and the magnitude of the ensemble-mean change is likely deceiving, as the greatest decreases are produced by the simulations that are the most biased in the baseline/current climate. Furthermore, some of the greatest decreases in precipitation are being driven by changes in processes/phenomena that are less credible (e.g., changes in El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation, when it is initially not simulated well). In other simulations, the processes driving the precipitation change may be plausible, but other biases (e.g., biases in low-level moisture or precipitation intensity) appear to be affecting the magnitude of the projected changes. The most and least credible simulations are clearly identified, while the other simulations are mixed in their abilities to produce projections of value.},

abstract = {The climate sensitivity of global climate models (GCMs) strongly influences projected climate change due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. Reasonably, the climate sensitivity of a GCM may be expected to affect dynamically downscaled projections. However, there has been little examination of the effect of the climate sensitivity of GCMs on regional climate model (RCM) ensembles. Therefore, we present projections of temperature and precipitation from the ensemble of projections produced as a part of the North American branch of the international Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) in the context of their relationship to the climate sensitivity of their parent GCMs. NA-CORDEX simulations were produced at 50-km and 25-km resolutions with multiple RCMs which downscaled multiple GCMs that spanned nearly the full range of climate sensitivity available in the CMIP5 archive. We show that climate sensitivity is a very important source of spread in the NA-CORDEX ensemble, particularly for temperature. Temperature projections correlate with driving GCM climate sensitivity annually and seasonally across North America not only at a continental scale but also at a local-to-regional scale. Importantly, the spread in temperature projections would be reduced if only low, mid, or high climate sensitivity simulations were considered, or if only the ensemble mean were considered. Precipitation projections correlate with climate sensitivity, but only at a continental scale during the cold season, due to the increasing influence of other processes at finer scales. Additionally, it is shown that the RCMs do alter the projection space sampled by their driving GCMs.},

abstract = {Current snow state descriptions and estimates of major snow characteristics (snow cover duration, maximum winter snow depth, snow water equivalent) up to 2010 have been recorded from 958 meteorological stations in Russia. Apart from the description of long-term averages of snow characteristics, the estimates of their change that are averaged over quasi-homogeneous climatic regions are derived and regional differences in the change of snow characteristics are studied. In recent decades, the Russian territory has experienced an increase in snow depth, both winter average and maximum snow depths, against the background of global temperature rise and sea ice reduction in the northern hemisphere. The first generalized regional characteristics of maximum snow water equivalent in the winter season have been obtained. According to field observations, an increase in water supply has been revealed in the north of the East European Plain, in the western part by 4.5{\%} (10yr)- 1 and in the eastern part by 6{\%}(10yr)- 1. This characteristic also increases by ∼ 6{\%}(10yr)- 1 in the southern forest zone of Western Siberia and in the Far East. Snow water equivalent in central Eastern Siberia increases by 3.4{\%} (10yr)- 1. From snow course observations in the forest, a tendency for a decrease in water supply (-6.4{\%}(10yr)- 1 is only found in the southwest of the East European Plain. Snow cover characteristics, being a product of several climate-forming factors that simultaneously affected them, change nonlinearly and different characteristics may and often do change differently with time. Therefore, one cannot assume that having information about the trend of one of the snow characteristics implies knowledge of the trend sign of others. In particular, whilst during the past four decades over the Russian Federation most snow cover characteristics - including the most important of them responsible for water supply - have increased, the only quantity that is reliably monitored from space (snow cover extent) has decreased, but in the last two decades this decrease has ceased. These tendencies are opposite to those observed in Canada and Alaska. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The climate in Mexico and Central America is influenced by the Pacific and the Atlantic oceanic basins and atmospheric conditions over continental North and South America. These factors and important ocean--atmosphere coupled processes make the region's climate a great challenge for global and regional climate modeling. We explore the benefits that coupled regional climate models may introduce in the representation of the regional climate with a set of coupled and uncoupled simulations forced by reanalysis and global model data. Uncoupled simulations tend to stay close to the large-scale patterns of the driving fields, particularly over the ocean, while over land they are modified by the regional atmospheric model physics and the improved orography representation. The regional coupled model adds to the reanalysis forcing the air--sea interaction, which is also better resolved than in the global model. Simulated fields are modified over the ocean, improving the representation of the key regional structures such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the Caribbean Low Level Jet. Higher resolution leads to improvements over land and in regions of intense air--sea interaction, e.g., off the coast of California. The coupled downscaling improves the representation of the Mid Summer Drought and the meridional rainfall distribution in southernmost Central America. Over the regions of humid climate, the coupling corrects the wet bias of the uncoupled runs and alleviates the dry bias of the driving model, yielding a rainfall seasonal cycle similar to that in the reanalysis-driven experiments.},

The results indicate that the oasis expansion increases the summer precipitation in the middle Tianshan Mountains while it has only a small effect over the oasis regions itself. The results indicate further that the oasis expansion affects mainly the late afternoon summer convective precipitation. The advection of air with additional moisture from the oasis areas to the mountains due to the mountain/plain circulation system during the day triggers the orographic precipitation in the middle mountain regions. These new results indicate that the oasis expansion could attribute significantly to the recent finding from observational studies about the increasing trend of precipitation in the middle Tianshan Mountains.},

This study extends back by one century our knowledge about the instrumental precipitation over the Western Mediterranean, and by two centuries in some specific subareas. All the time series show repeated swings. No specific trends have been found over the whole period, except in a few cases, but with modest time changes and sometimes having opposite tendency. The same can be said for the most recent decades although with some more marked departures from the average. The correlation between the various Mediterranean subareas is generally not significant, or almost uncorrelated. The Wavelet Spectral Analysis applied to the precipitation identifies only a minor 56-year cycle in autumn, i. e., the same return period that has been found in literature for the Sea Surface Temperature over North Atlantic. A comparison with a gridded dataset reconstruction based on mixed multiproxy and instrumental observations, shows that the grid reconstruction is in good agreement with the observed data for the period after 1900, less for the previous period. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

A semantic web, wherein different applications and Web sites can exchange information and hence exploit Web data and information to their full potential, requires the information about Web resources to be represented in a detailed and structured manner. Resource Description Framework (RDF), an effort in this direction supported by the World Wide Web Consortium, provides a means for the description of metadata which is a necessity for the next generation of interoperable Web applications. The success of RDF and the semantic web will depend on (1) the development of applications that prove the applicability of the concept, (2) the availability of application interfaces which enable the development of such applications, and (3) databases and inference systems that exploit RDF to identify and locate most relevant Web resources. In addition, many practical issues, such as security, ease of use, and compatibility, will be crucial in the success of RDF. This survey aims at providing a glimpse at the past, present, and future of this upcoming technology and highlights why we believe that the next generation of the Web will be more organized, informative, searchable, accessible, and, most importantly, useful.

Wepropose to improve model simulations by assimilating SWE data from sporadic manual snow surveys with a particle filter. A temporally and spatially correlated perturbation of themeteorological forcing is used to generate the set of particles. The magnitude of the perturbations is fixed objectively. First, the particle filter and direct insertion were both applied on 88 sites for which measured SWE consisted of more or less five values per year over a period of 17 years. The temporal correlation of perturbations enables us to improve the accuracy and the ensemble dispersion of the particle filter, while the spatial correlation leads to a spatial coherence in the particle weights. The spatial estimates of SWE obtained with the particle filter are compared with those obtained through optimal interpolation of the snow survey data, which is the current operational practice in Quebec. Cross-validation results as well as validation against an independent dataset show that the proposed particle filter enables us to improve the spatial distribution of the snow water equivalent compared with optimal interpolation.},

abstract = {A sharp temperature contrast, observed mostly in summer, between high temperatures over land and lower temperatures over the ocean and the typical summer synoptic scale configuration (high-pressure system over the ocean and thermal low inland) are responsible for the development of a coastal low-level jet (CLLJ). The low-level horizontal pressure gradient induces, through geostrophic adjustment, a strong alongshore flow, which is also influenced by local orography and the high-pressure subsidence over the maritime boundary layer. In this study, the EURO-CORDEX hindcast forced by ERA-Interim (1989–2009), the historic reference (1960–2006) and the future (2006–2100; RCP8.5) simulations, forced by EC-Earth global model, are used to determine the climate change signal on the CLLJ off the Iberian Peninsula's western coast. Although the boundary conditions of the hindcast and historic reference simulations have different resolutions, both have similar distributions and features of CLLJ. In the summer, a clear rise in the occurrence of CLLJ is expected throughout the 21st century, with the highest increase off the northwest coast of Iberia ({\~{}}14{\%}). The CLLJ prevailing height is confined between 300 and 400 m and the most frequent maximum wind speed is 15 m s−1 both in present and future climate; nevertheless, a shift to higher values is expected. The predominant wind direction at jet height is north–northeast in all simulations. The temporal evolution of CLLJ occurrence during the 21st century shows that there is no significant trend in spring and autumn, although some decadal variability is observed.},

abstract = {Daily precipitation statistics as simulated by the ERA-Interim-driven EURO-CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) ensemble are evaluated over two distinct regions of the European continent, namely the European Alps and Spain. The potential added value of the high-resolution 12 km experiments with respect to their 50 km resolution counterparts is investigated. The statistics considered consist of wet-day intensity and precipitation frequency as a measure of mean precipitation, and three precipitation-derived indicators (90th percentile on wet days—90pWET, contribution of the very wet days to total precipitation—R95pTOT and number of consecutive dry days—CDD). As reference for model evaluation high resolution gridded observational data over continental Spain (Spain011/044) and the Alpine region (EURO4M-APGD) are used. The assessment and comparison of the two resolutions is accomplished not only on their original horizontal grids (approximately 12 and 50 km), but the high-resolution RCMs are additionally regridded onto the coarse 50 km grid by grid cell aggregation for the direct comparison with the low resolution simulations. The direct application of RCMs e.g. in many impact modelling studies is hampered by model biases. Therefore bias correction (BC) techniques are needed at both resolutions to ensure a better agreement between models and observations. In this work, the added value of the high resolution (before and after the bias correction) is assessed and the suitability of these BC methods is also discussed. Three basic BC methods are applied to isolate the effect of biases in mean precipitation, wet-day intensity and wet-day frequency on the derived indicators. Daily precipitation percentiles are strongly affected by biases in the wet-day intensity, whereas the dry spells are better represented when the simulated precipitation frequency is adjusted to the observed one. This confirms that there is no single optimal way to correct for RCM biases, since correcting some distributional features typically leads to an improvement of some aspects but to a deterioration of others. Regarding mean seasonal biases before the BC, we find only limited evidence for an added value of the higher resolution in the precipitation intensity and frequency or in the derived indicators. Thereby, evaluation results considerably depend on the RCM, season and indicator considered. High resolution simulations better reproduce the indicators' spatial patterns, especially in terms{\ldots}},

abstract = {The efficient management of water resources and services continues to be a concern in many of the small island states of the Caribbean. There are growing concerns over the ability of governments in the region to ensure the good management and provision of water without jeopardizing economic growth and the maintenance of social well-being. This paper provides an overview of the major factors influencing the water security facing the Caribbean Region and how the emerging concerns are being addressed. The key challenges and vulnerabilities may be summarized as lack of data and barriers to making available what information there is. Forward planning has been largely neglected and is symptomatic of a lack of appreciation of the need for having national water policies. In this respect Jamaica's development of a national master water plan serves as a good example of what is needed. Water service providers have to be efficient, well managed and allowed to do their job. This means that they have to be on a sound financial footing. The challenge is to find the balance between appropriate political and regulatory oversight and the autonomy of water managers and service providers. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The sensitivity of the RASM near-surface climate to changes in atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice parameters and physics is evaluated in four simulations. The near-surface atmospheric circulation is well simulated in all four RASM simulations but biases in surface temperature are caused by biases in downward surface radiative fluxes. Errors in radiative fluxes are due to biases in simulated clouds with different versions of RASM simulating either too much or too little cloud radiative impact over open ocean regions and all versions simulating too little cloud radiative impact over land areas. Cold surface temperature biases in the central Arctic in winter are likely due to too few or too radiatively thin clouds. The precipitation simulated by RASM is sensitive to changes in evaporation that were linked to sea surface temperature...},

abstract = { AbstractGlobal climate models are challenged to represent the North American monsoon, in terms of its climatology and interannual variability. To investigate whether a regional atmospheric model can improve warm season forecasts in North America, a retrospective Climate Forecast System (CFS) model reforecast (1982–2000) and the corresponding NCEP–NCAR reanalysis are dynamically downscaled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), with similar parameterization options as used for high-resolution numerical weather prediction and a new spectral nudging capability. The regional model improves the climatological representation of monsoon precipitation because of its more realistic representation of the diurnal cycle of convection. However, it is challenged to capture organized, propagating convection at a distance from terrain, regardless of the boundary forcing data used. Dynamical downscaling of CFS generally yields modest improvement in surface temperature and precipitation anomaly correlations in those regions where it is already positive in the global model. For the North American monsoon region, WRF adds value to the seasonally forecast temperature only in early summer and does not add value to the seasonally forecast precipitation. CFS has a greater ability to represent the large-scale atmospheric circulation in early summer because of the influence of Pacific SST forcing. The temperature and precipitation anomaly correlations in both the global and regional model are thus relatively higher in early summer than late summer. As the dominant modes of early warm season precipitation are better represented in the regional model, given reasonable large-scale atmospheric forcing, dynamical downscaling will add value to warm season seasonal forecasts. CFS performance appears to be inconsistent in this regard. },

abstract = {Regional climate change scenarios for Baja California/Southern California (BCC) and the North American monsoon (NAM) were produced as part of the Baja California State Climate Change Action Program (PEACC-BC). Bias-corrected and spatially downscaled scenarios (BCSD) from six general circulation models (GCMs) with a total of 12 realizations were analyzed for two scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES): B1 (low emissions) and A2 (high emissions) during the twenty-first century. A validation of the original GCM realizations and the BCSD scenarios with observed data during 1961–90 show that the ensemble GCM produces too much precipitation during autumn and winter, which could be the cause of the observed delay of the summer monsoon rains; the ensemble BCSD considerably improves the mean annual cycles and spatial distributions of precipitation and temperature in the region. However, both ensembles greatly underestimate the observed interannual variability of precipitation. BCSD scenarios of temperature and precipitation during the twenty-first century were evaluated on the basis of the multimodel median change relative to 1961–90. The scenarios of precipitation change show large interannual variations and larger uncertainties than the scenarios of temperature change. The A2 scenarios show the largest reductions of precipitation in the last 20 yr of the twenty-first century; a decrease of 30{\%} is projected for BCC mainly in winter and spring, while precipitation in the NAM region could be weakened by 20{\%} during winter, spring, and summer. After 2050, a significant reduction of precipitation is expected in northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States south of 35°N, and temperature changes larger than 2°C warming.},

abstract = {The existence of several gridded precipitation products (GPP) has facilitated studies related to climate change, climate modeling, as well as a better understanding of the physical processes underpinning this key variable. Due to complexities in estimating rainfall, gridded datasets exhibit different levels of accuracy across regions, even when they are developed at relatively high resolution or using sophisticated procedures. The performance of 16 GPP are evaluated over the Caribbean region, which includes the Caribbean Islands, and portions of Central South America. Monthly data for sixty weather stations are used as a reference for the period 1983{\&}ndash;2010. The 16 GPP include six products based on station data only, two that combine ground station and satellite information, two merging station and reanalysis information, four based on reanalysis, and two using multisource information. The temporal resolution of the GPP ranged between daily and monthly and spatial resolution from 0.033{\&}deg; to 0.5{\&}deg;. The methodological approach employed combined a comparison of regional and sub-regional precipitation annual cycles, the Kling{\&}ndash;Gupta efficiency (KGE) index, as well as several metrics derived from the standardized precipitation index (SPI). Overall, the best performances were obtained from GPCC025 and MSWEP2, likely reflecting the positive impact of the large number of station data utilized in their development. It is also demonstrated that a higher spatial resolution does not always mean better accuracy. There is a need for this kind of assessment when undertaking climate studies in regions like the Caribbean where resolution is a significant consideration. ERA5 performed best among the reanalyses analyzed and has the potential to be used to develop regionally based GPP by applying bias correction or downscaling techniques. The methodological approach employed provides a comprehensive and robust evaluation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of GPP in the Caribbean region.},

The model simulations are performed at 60 km and at 8 km horizontal resolutions. The higher resolution is chosen to partly resolve the detailed orography of the countries selected, providing insight into the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation for an individual island that GCMs are unable to represent. The downscaling is carried out in two steps. First, CCAM simulations are run on a global 60 km grid using bias-corrected sea surface temperatures (SST) and sea ice from six CMIP3 GCMs. Three of these 60 km simulations are then further downscaled to 8 km resolution over the two countries. The focus of this paper is validation of these high-resolution simulations against gridded analyses, satellite rainfall climatologies and available station data for rainfall and temperature for the period 1980-2000. The results show that high resolution orography plays an important role in capturing the current climate. The validation demonstrates that the 8 km simulations are capable of realistically depicting the current climate when the topography influences the wind flow and rainfall (Fiji), performing better than both the GCMs and the 60 km downscaled simulations. However, the performance of the 8 km simulations is similar to the GCM and 60 km simulations when topographical features are not present (FSM).},

abstract = {Abstract Progresses in climatological, ecological, and hydrological studies that focused on the Tianshan mountains area (known as ?the water tower of Central Asia?) have been restricted by the availability of station observations as well as high resolution and quality dataset. With the aim to overcome some of these difficulties, the high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model is run over the Tianshan mountains area driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Double nesting method was used with a horizontal resolution of 40 and 8 km covering the period 1980-2018. A decade of simulation from 1980 to 1989, a period when most abundant station observations are available, is considered for validation. These downscaled results are compared against station observations and three widely used spatially interpolated products in order to investigate the added value of the dynamical downscaling approach. Results of these comparisons show that the WRF downscaled data outperform and add significant details to ERA-Interim reanalysis. A remarkable improvement of the WRF simulation is found at reproducing the observed seasonal cycle of daily extreme temperatures and precipitation. Due to better representation of orography, WRF simulations are able to capture extreme precipitation events which are missing in the high-quality interpolated products. Refining the resolution from 40 to 8 km further improves the model performance, particularly at depicting orographic enhancement of precipitation. The validated WRF model can be used in future climate projections studies, and this high-resolution as well as high-quality climatological dataset we present here is useful for impact and further downstream studies.},

abstract = {This study analyzed the temporal precipitation variations in the arid Central Asia (ACA) and their regional differences during 1930–2009 using monthly gridded precipitation from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU). Our results showed that the annual precipitation in this westerly circulation dominated arid region is generally increasing during the past 80 years, with an apparent increasing trend (0.7 mm/10 a) in winter. The precipitation variations in ACA also differ regionally, which can be divided into five distinct subregions (I West Kazakhstan region, II East Kazakhstan region, III Central Asia Plains region, IV Kyrgyzstan region, and V Iran Plateau region). The annual precipitation falls fairly even on all seasons in the two northern subregions (regions I and II, approximately north of 45°N), whereas the annual precipitation is falling mainly on winter and spring (accounting for up to 80{\%} of the annual total precipitation) in the three southern subregions. The annual precipitation is increasing on all subregions except the southwestern ACA (subregion V) during the past 80 years. A significant increase in precipitation appeared in subregions I and III. The long-term trends in annual precipitation in all subregions are determined mainly by trends in winter precipitation. Additionally, the precipitation in ACA has significant interannual variations. The 2–3-year cycle is identified in all subregions, while the 5–6-year cycle is also found in the three southern subregions. Besides the inter-annual variations, there were 3–4 episodic precipitation variations in all subregions, with the latest episodic change that started in the mid- to late 1970s. The precipitations in most of the study regions are fast increasing since the late 1970s. Overall, the responses of ACA precipitation to global warming are complicated. The variations of westerly circulation are likely the major factors that influence the precipitation variations in the study region.},

There is no significant difference in the future changes in EASM intensity, EASM precipitation, and its location among the three scenarios. A moisture budget analysis demonstrates that the increased precipitation over East Asia in three scenarios should be ascribed to the changes in evaporation, vertical motion, and humidity. The contributions of these three dominant terms increase sequentially under 1.5degNE, 1.5degOS, and 2degNE scenarios. However, the differences among the three scenarios are quite small in three dominant terms. Over East Asia, the contributions of evaporation and vertical motion are generally larger than that of humidity to the domain-averaged EASM rainfall in each scenario.},

abstract = {Long-term changes in convective and stratiform precipitation in Northern Eurasia (NE) over the last five decades are estimated. Different types of precipitation are separated according to their genesis using routine meteorological observations of precipitation, weather conditions, and morphological cloud types for the period 1966–2016. From an initial 538 stations, the main analysis is performed for 326 stations that have no gaps and meet criteria regarding the artificial discontinuity absence in the data. A moderate increase in total precipitation over the analyzed period is accompanied by a relatively strong growth of convective precipitation and a concurrent decrease in stratiform precipitation. Convective and stratiform precipitation totals, precipitation intensity and heavy precipitation sums depict major changes in summer, while the relative contribution of the two precipitation types to the total precipitation (including the contribution of heavy rain events) show the strongest trends in transition seasons. The contribution of heavy convective showers to the total precipitation increases with the statistically significant trend of1{\%}–2{\%}per decade in vastNEregions, reaching5{\%}per decade at a number of stations. The largest increase is found over the southern Far East region, mostly because of positive changes in convective precipitation intensity with a linear trend of more than 1mm/day/ decade, implying a 13.8{\%} increase per 1 °Cwarming. In general, stratiform precipitation decreases over the majority ofNEregions in all seasons except for winter. This decrease happens at slower rates in comparison to the convective precipitation changes. The overall changes in the character of precipitation over the majority ofNE regions are characterized by a redistribution of precipitation types toward more heavy showers.},

abstract = {New Zealand has a long, continuous record of annual end-of-summer-snowline measurements for a set of Southern Alps ‘index glaciers' from 1977 to present. These index glaciers are used to estimate annual mass balance and volume water equivalent changes for the over 3000 glaciers on the Southern Alps. Two methods are employed to monitor ice volume changes. Method I deals with the rapid to normal response time glaciers, which tend to be small to medium in size. It uses mass balance gradients and glacier areas to convert changes in snowlines to changes in ice volume water equivalent. Ice volume changes for the period 1976–2008 are calculated for each index glacier, and then extrapolated to most other glaciers of the Southern Alps, using the New Zealand glacier inventory. Method II deals with 12 protracted response glaciers, which tend to be large in size. These have been slow in reacting to a long-term regional warming trend. Instead they still largely retain the ablation areas of a century ago and are in a state of disequilibrium with the present climate. These valley glaciers have recently sustained substantial ice losses that are not able to be detected using Method I. Mass balance deficits and ablation from the 12 large protracted response glaciers are estimated using a geodetic approach based on topographic and lake changes determined from repeated surveys. Results show that estimated ice volume (in water equivalents) for the Southern Alps has decreased from 54.5km3 in 1976 to 46.1km3 by 2008. This equates to a rate of −0.3km3a−1 over the last three decades, but this is considerably less than the rate of ice volume loss estimated for the previous 100years. More than 3000 small and medium-size glaciers account for just 29{\%} of the overall ice volume loss from the Southern Alps, while 71{\%} of the loss occurs from the 12 large protracted response glaciers. Terminus calving contributes 0.8km3 and down-wasting of ice tongues in the ablation zone contributes 5.2km3. Some preliminary results show that ice volume changes are related to changes in circulation over the New Zealand region.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT By performing a statistical change-point analysis of activities of the tropical cyclones (TCs) that have affected Korea (K-TCs), it was found that there was a significant change between 1983 and 1984. During the period of 1984-2004 (P2), more TCs migrated toward the west, recurved in the southwest, and affected Korea, compared to the period of 1965-1983 (P1). These changes for P2 were related to the southwestward expansion of the subtropical western Pacific high (SWPH) and, simultaneously, elongation of its elliptical shape toward Korea. Because of these changes, the central pressure and lifetime of K-TC during P2 were deeper and longer, respectively, than figures for P1. This stronger K-TC intensity for P2 was related to the more southwestward genesis due to the southwestward expansion of the SWPH. The weaker vertical wind shear environment during P2 was more favorable for K-TC to maintain a strong intensity in the mid-latitudes of East Asia.},

abstract = {Analysis of regional climate simulations to evaluate the ability of 11 Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment in South Asia experiments (CORDEX-South Asia) along with their ensemble to produce precipitation from June to September (JJAS) over the Himalayan region have been carried out. These suite of 11 combinations come from 6 regional climate models (RCMs) driven with 10 initial and boundary conditions from different global climate models and are collectively referred here as 11 CORDEX South Asia experiments. All the RCMs use a similar domain and are having similar spatial resolution of 0.44° ({\~{}}50 km). The set of experiments are considered to study precipitation sensitivity associated with the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) over the study region. This effort is made as ISM plays a vital role in summertime precipitation over the Himalayan region which acts as driver for the sustenance of habitat, population, crop, glacier, hydrology etc. In addition, so far the summer monsoon precipitation climatology over the Himalayan region has not been studied with the help of CORDEX data. Thus this study is initiated to evaluate the ability of the experiments and their ensemble in reproducing the characteristics of summer monsoon precipitation over Himalayan region, for the present climate (1970–2005). The precipitation climatology, annual precipitation cycles and interannual variabilities from each simulation have been assessed against the gridded observational dataset: Asian Precipitation- Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards the Evaluation of Water Resources for the given time period. Further, after the selection of the better performing experiment the frequency distribution of precipitation was also studied. In this study, an approach has also been made to study the degree of agreement among individual experiments as a way to quantify the uncertainty among them. The experiments though show a wide variation among themselves and individually over time and space in simulating precipitation distribution over the study region, but noticeably along the foothills of the Himalayas all the simulations show dry precipitation bias against the corresponding observation. In addition, as we move towards higher elevation regions these experiments in general show wet bias. The experiment driven by EC-EARTH global climate model and downscaled using Rossby Center regional Atmospheric model version 4 developed by Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI-RCA4) simulate precipitation closely in correspondence with the observation. The ensemble outperforms the result of individual experiments. Correspondingly, different kinds of statistical analysis like spatial and temporal correlation, Taylor diagram, frequency distribution and scatter plot have been performed to compare the model output with observation and to explain the associated resemblance, robustness and dynamics statistically. Through the bias and ensemble spread analysis, an estimation of the uncertainty of the model fields and the degree of agreement among them has also been carried out in this study. Overview of the study suggests that these experiments facilitate precipitation evolution and structure over the Himalayan region with certain degree of uncertainty.},

abstract = {Phase 5 of the CoupledModel Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) climate models' projections of the 2014-2100 Arctic warming under radiative forcing from representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) vary from 0.9° to 6.7°C. Climate models with or without a full indirect aerosol effect are both equally successful in reproducing the observed (1900-2014) Arctic warming and its trends. However, the 2014-2100 Arctic warming and the warming trends projected by models that include a full indirect aerosol effect (denoted here as AA models) are significantly higher (mean projected Arctic warming is about 1.5°C higher) than those projected by models without a full indirect aerosol effect (denoted here as NAA models). The suggestion is that, within models including full indirect aerosol effects, those projecting stronger future changes are not necessarily distinguishable historically because any stronger past warming may have been partially offset by stronger historical aerosol cooling. The CMIP5 models that include a full indirect aerosol effect follow an inverse radiative forcing to equilibrium climate sensitivity relationship, while models without it do not.},

This warming trend can be observed in the annual mean temperatures, daily minimum mean temperatures and to a lesser extent, daily maximum mean temperatures. Precipitation and temperature extremes for the period 1951–2010 were also analysed relative to the mean 1961–1990 baseline values. Some stations (Cotabato, Iloilo, Laoag and Tacloban,) show increases in both frequency and intensity of extreme daily rainfall events which are significant at the 95{\%} level with none of the stations showing decreasing trends. The frequency of daily temperature maximum above the 99th percentile (hot days) and nights at the 1st percentile (cold nights) suggests that both days and nights in particular are becoming warmer. Such indicators of a warming trend and increase in extreme events in the Philippines are discussed in the context of similar national, regional (Asia Pacific) and global studies. The relevance of such empirically based climatology studies, particularly for nations such as the Philippines which are increasingly vulnerable to the multiple impacts of global climate change, is also considered.},

This transition is accompanied by a consistent transition in the sea level pressure trend pattern that supports warm air advection over the Arctic and cold air advection over the continents. The regression of the detrended DJF‐average SAT onto a detrended index defined to quantify the east‐west gradient of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) is characterized by a warm‐Arctic‐cold‐continent pattern much like the SAT trend pattern observed in recent decades. A decadal timescale warming of the western tropical Pacific water has increased the east‐west gradient of tropical Pacific SST, thus contributing to the observed extratropical SAT trend transition.},

Here, we use an ensemble of climate model experiments to show this recent warming lies within the upper bounds of the simulated range of natural variability. The warming resulted from a strong cyclonic anomaly in the Weddell Sea caused by increasing sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific. This circulation, coupled with a positive polarity of the Southern Annular Mode, advected warm and moist air from the South Atlantic into the Antarctic interior. These results underscore the intimate linkage of interior Antarctic climate to tropical variability. Further, this study shows that atmospheric internal variability can induce extreme regional climate change over the Antarctic interior, which has masked any anthropogenic warming signal there during the twenty-first century.},

Significant increasing temperature trends were found in each of the following regions examined: all of Africa, Northern Hemisphere Africa, Southern Hemisphere Africa, tropical Africa, and subtropical Africa. Considering the months June–August, regions in both North and South Africa saw significantly warmer temperatures in the most recent period 1995–2010 than in the period 1979–94. However, for the months December–February, the significant warming was concentrated in the north of Africa.When the two most recent decades are compared with the period 1979–90, warming is observed over these same regions and is concentrated in the most recent decade, from 2001 to 2010. The results presented here indicate that the climate change over Africa is likely not predominantly a result of variations in the El Nin˜o–Southern Oscillation (a teleconnection that has been previously shown to affect climate in some parts ofAfrica). Instead the climate changes likely occur owing to other natural variability of the climate and/or may be a result of human activity. However, even without ascertaining the specific causes, the most important finding in this work is to demonstrate that a significant rise in African temperatures occurred between 1979 and 2010.},

abstract = {The Arctic is a region in transformation. Warming in the region has been amplified, as expected from ice-albedo feedback effects, with the rate of warming observed to be ∼0.60 ± 0.07°C/decade in the Arctic ({\textgreater}64°N) compared to ∼0.17°C/decade globally during the last three decades. This increase in surface temperature is manifested in all components of the cryosphere. In particular, the sea ice extent has been declining at the rate of ∼3.8{\%}/decade, whereas the perennial ice (represented by summer ice minimum) is declining at a much greater rate of ∼11.5{\%}/decade. Spring snow cover has also been observed to be declining by -2.12{\%}/decade for the period 1967-2012. The Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass at the rate of ∼34.0 Gt/year (sea level equivalence of 0.09 mm/year) during the period from 1992 to 2011, but for the period 2002-2011, a higher rate of mass loss of ∼215 Gt/year has been observed. Also, the mass of glaciers worldwide declined at the rate of 226 Gt/year from 1971 to 2009 and 275 Gt/year from 1993 to 2009. Increases in permafrost temperature have also been measured in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere while a thickening of the active layer that overlies permafrost and a thinning of seasonally frozen ground has also been reported. To gain insight into these changes, comparative analysis with trends in clouds, albedo, and the Arctic Oscillation is also presented.

abstract = {The paper shows the first of this size ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) projections for Europe completed within the EURO-CORDEX coordinated projects. The projections are available for two climate scenarios the RCP2.6 (22) and RCP8.5 (55 members) at a 0.11degree resolution from 11 RCM driven by 8 GCMs. The regional ensemble results are compared with the driving CMIP5 global models but also with the last generation CMIP6 global models. Maximum warming is projected by all the 3 ensembles in Northern Europe in winter, associated with maximum precipitation increase; the opposite is happening in summer with the maximum warming in the Mediterranean and Southern European regions associated with maximum precipitation decrease. The CMIP6 ensemble projects the highest values of warming with the highest spread and highest precipitation increase and decrease while the EURO-CORDEX warms the least and has lower precipitation maxima and minimum but with increased spatial details on complex topography, along the coasts and islands and a more accurate land-sea contrast. There is a high inter model consensus among all the ensemble for increase of extreme precipitation with maximum 15{\%} spread in the Mediterranean region, and increase of drought frequency in the Mediterranean. Extreme temperature indices project increase of heat extremes and decrease of cold extreme with the analogous behavior of the 3 ensembles as for temperature e.g CMIP6 showing the highest values and EURO-CORDEX revealing the most details. With such RCM-GCM ensembles, information can be provided on climate projections and quantification of the signal spread both being quite important for climate services and climate impact community.},

abstract = {Under the CORDEX umbrella the CORDEX-CORE initiative has been developed that was able to produce an ensemble of two RCM at 0.22° resolution downscaling 3 GCM for each of the 9 CORDEX domains for two climate scenario the RCP2.6 and the RCP8.5. The CORDEX-CORE and the CMIP5 driving ensemble together with the most recently produced CMIP6 ensemble has been analyzed and several temperature, heat, wet and dry hazard indicators have been computed for the present day and mid and far future time slices. As a results CORDEX-CORE shows a better validation for several hazard indices due to the higher spatial resolution. For the far future time slice the 3 ensembles project an increase for all the temperature and heat indices under the RCC8.5 scenario. The highest values are always shown by the CMIP6 ensemble except that for Tx{\textgreater}35 °C for which CORDEX-CORE projects higher warming. Extreme wet and flood prone maxima are projected by the regional ensemble over la Plata basin in South America , over the Congo basin in Africa, in east North America, north east Europe , India and Indochina, notably the regions where a better validation is obtained, whereas the global ensembles show quite small or not existent signal. Compound hazard hotspots based on heat and drought indicators have been identified in Central America, in the Amazon region, in the Mediterranean, South Africa, India and Australia since in all these regions a linear relation is shown by the heatwave and drought change signal. Although still limited the CORDEX-CORE initiative was able to produce high resolution climate projections with a quasi global coverage. This can be seen as a first step to foster collaboration among the global and regional climate community. The existence of the first of this kind ensemble together with the previous CORDEX 0.44 ensembles and the global ensemble is very valuable for climate impact assessment studies since can provide information on the mean and extreme regional climate projections but also more robust quantification on the model spread. All being an added value for the impact and climate services communities.},

abstract = {We describe the construction of a new version of the Europe-wide E-OBS temperature (daily minimum, mean, and maximum values) and precipitation data set. This version provides an improved estimation of interpolation uncertainty through the calculation of a 100-member ensemble of realizations of each daily field. The data set covers the period back to 1950 and provides gridded fields at a spacing of 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ in regular latitude/longitude coordinates. As with the original E-OBS data set, the ensemble version is based on the station series collated as part of the ECA{\&}D initiative. Station density varies significantly over the domain, and over time, and a reliable estimation of interpolation uncertainty in the gridded fields is therefore important for users of the data set. The uncertainty quantified by the ensemble data set is more realistic than the uncertainty estimates in the original version, although uncertainty is still underestimated in data-sparse regions. The new data set is compared against the earlier version of E-OBS and against regional gridded data sets produced by a selection of National Meteorological Services. In terms of both climatological averages and extreme values, the new version of E-OBS is broadly comparable to the earlier version. Nonetheless, users will notice differences between the two E-OBS versions, especially for precipitation, which arises from the different gridding method used.},

abstract = {Abstract The southern Mexico and Central America (SMCA) region shows a dominant well-defined precipitation annual cycle. The rainy season usually begins in May and ends in October, with a relatively dry period in July and August known as the mid-summer drought (MSD); notable exceptions are the Caribbean coast of Honduras and Costa Rica. This MSD phenomenon is expected to be affected as the SMCA experiences an enhanced differential warming between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (PO-AO) towards the end of the 21st century. Previous studies have suggested that this differential warming will induce a strengthening of the westward Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) and that this heightened CLLJ will shift precipitation westwards, falling on the PO instead that within the SMCA region causing a severe drought. In this work we examine this scenario with a new model, the Rossby Center Regional Climate Model (RCA4), for the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) Central America domain, forced with different general circulation models (GCMs) and for different representative concentration paths (RCPs). We consider 25-year periods as “present conditions” (1981–2005) and “future scenario” (2071–2095), focusing on the “extended summer” season (May–October). Results suggest that in the future the spatial extension of the MSD will decrease and that in certain areas the MSD will be more intense but less frequent compared to present conditions. Also, the oceanic differential warming, the intensification of the CLLJ, and the reduction in regional precipitation in the future scenario, suggested by previous works, were verified in this study.},

abstract = {This study examines the simulated temperature over Southeast Asia (SEA) using the Regional Climate Model version 4.3 (RegCM4.3), and its sensitivity to selected cumulus and ocean surface flux schemes. Model simulations were conducted for the SEA domain at 36 km spatial resolution for the period of 1989–2008, as part of the Southeast Asia Regional Climate Downscaling/Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-Southeast Asia (SEACLID/CORDEX-Southeast Asia) project. A total of 18 sensitivity experiments were conducted with a combination of six cumulus parameterization schemes and three ocean surface flux schemes. The model's skill in representing mean, maximum and minimum temperatures is evaluated against observed gridded data sets. Results indicate a predominant cold bias in all simulations, particularly over mainland SEA (Indochina) during the season of December to February. Nevertheless, the seasonal correlation is highest over this region. The cold bias of the model is also evident in the temperature distributions, such that there are more cold months than observed, which may be associated with the underestimation of the daily maximum temperature. A few simulations also reveal a warm bias over some areas in the Maritime Continent. Further examination shows that both radiative and surface fluxes influence the simulated temperature, which may also have effects that partially offset each other in some areas. Comparison of the sensitivity experiments reveals differences in model performance, and underlines the importance in choosing the appropriate configuration for RegCM4.3 before it is used to downscale climate projections, particularly for the SEA region. This study also shows a strong influence of the choice of cumulus scheme on temperature. Based on performance metrics for temperature among the schemes tested, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Emanuel cumulus scheme and the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme version 1e (BATS1e) ocean surface flux scheme can be used in future simulations for the region.},

abstract = {Abstract. The WFDE5 dataset has been generated using the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) methodology applied to surface meteorological variables from the ERA5 reanalysis. The WFDEI dataset had previously been generated by applying the WFD methodology to ERA-Interim. The WFDE5 is provided at 0.5∘ spatial resolution but has higher temporal resolution (hourly) compared to WFDEI (3-hourly). It also has higher spatial variability since it was generated by aggregation of the higher-resolution ERA5 rather than by interpolation of the lower-resolution ERA-Interim data. Evaluation against meteorological observations at 13 globally distributed FLUXNET2015 sites shows that, on average, WFDE5 has lower mean absolute error and higher correlation than WFDEI for all variables. Bias-adjusted monthly precipitation totals of WFDE5 result in more plausible global hydrological water balance components when analysed in an uncalibrated hydrological model (WaterGAP) than with the use of raw ERA5 data for model forcing. The dataset, which can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.20d54e34 (C3S, 2020b), is distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) through its Climate Data Store (CDS, C3S, 2020a) and currently spans from the start of January 1979 to the end of 2018. The dataset has been produced using a number of CDS Toolbox applications, whose source code is available with the data – allowing users to regenerate part of the dataset or apply the same approach to other data. Future updates are expected spanning from 1950 to the most recent year. A sample of the complete dataset, which covers the whole of the year 2016, is accessible without registration to the CDS at https://doi.org/10.21957/935p-cj60 (Cucchi et al., 2020).},

LE show similar biases in the mean austral summer rainfall and interannual variability than those detected in previous model sets, such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The positive trends in south-eastern South America (SESA) and negative ones in the southern Andes (SAn), that are the most significant observed regional features, are identified to some extent in LE simulations. The negative trend in SAn is a feature consistently shown among different models. For all models, mean trend is negative in that particular region and larger than the inter-member dispersion for each large ensemble. Trend magnitudes in the SESA region show a larger dispersion between models than the SAn region. While the mean trend among models is consistent with the observations, models underestimate the observed trend. The multi-model ensemble of selected models that best reproduce both mean and interannual variability features of rainfall in South America shows an 18{\%} larger positive mean trend in SESA rainfall than those that have the worst performance. However, internal variability uncertainty is still higher than the mean trend for both sets of multi-model ensembles [5{\%} (18{\%}) for selected (non-selected) models]. Improvements in the representation of the main features of mean rainfall and variability are needed in order to better describe and reduce the uncertainties associated with the main climate change related signals in the continent.},

abstract = {Abstract The Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic North Atlantic is experiencing rapid changes in the surface climate and sea ice distribution, with impacts for the coupled climate system and the local society. This study utilizes observational data of surface air temperature (SAT) from 1980?2016 across the whole Svalbard archipelago, and sea ice extent (SIE) from operational sea ice charts to conduct a systematic assessment of climatologies, long-term changes and regional differences. The proximity to the warm water mass of the West Spitsbergen Current drives a markedly warmer climate in the western coastal regions compared to northern and eastern Svalbard. This imprints on the SIE climatology in southern and western Svalbard, where the annual maxima of 50?60{\%} area ice coverage are substantially less than 80?90{\%} in the northern and eastern fjords. Owing to winter-amplified warming, the local climate is shifting towards more maritime conditions, and SIE reductions of between 5 and 20{\%} per decade in particular regions are found, such that a number of fjords in the west have been virtually ice-free in recent winters. The strongest decline comes along with SAT forcing and occurs over the most recent 1?2 decades in all regions; while in the 1980s and 1990s, enhanced northerly winds and sea ice drift can explain 30?50{\%} of SIE variability around northern Svalbard, where they had correspondingly lead to a SIE increase. With an ongoing warming it is suggested that both the meteorological and cryospheric conditions in eastern Svalbard will become increasingly similar to what is already observed in the western fjords, namely suppressed typical Arctic climate conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract This article reviews recent literature on drought of the last millennium, followed by an update on global aridity changes from 1950 to 2008. Projected future aridity is presented based on recent studies and our analysis of model simulations. Dry periods lasting for years to decades have occurred many times during the last millennium over, for example, North America, West Africa, and East Asia. These droughts were likely triggered by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with La Ni{\~{n}}a-like SST anomalies leading to drought in North America, and El-Ni{\~{n}}o-like SSTs causing drought in East China. Over Africa, the southward shift of the warmest SSTs in the Atlantic and warming in the Indian Ocean are responsible for the recent Sahel droughts. Local feedbacks may enhance and prolong drought. Global aridity has increased substantially since the 1970s due to recent drying over Africa, southern Europe, East and South Asia, and eastern Australia. Although El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), tropical Atlantic SSTs, and Asian monsoons have played a large role in the recent drying, recent warming has increased atmospheric moisture demand and likely altered atmospheric circulation patterns, both contributing to the drying. Climate models project increased aridity in the 21st century over most of Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Regions like the United States have avoided prolonged droughts during the last 50 years due to natural climate variations, but might see persistent droughts in the next 20–50 years. Future efforts to predict drought will depend on models' ability to predict tropical SSTs.

abstract = {The appropriate development of graphical visualisations to communicate climate data is fundamental to the provision of climate services to guide climate change adaptation decisions. However, at present there is a lack of empirical evidence, particularly in Africa, to help climate information providers determine how best to communicate and display climate data. To help address this issue, an online survey, primarily targeted at the African vulnerability, impacts and adaptation community, was designed and disseminated widely. The survey examines the interpretation of climate data as a function of the style and information content of graphical visualisations. It is shown that choices made when constructing the visualisations, such as presenting percentile information versus showing the range, significantly impact on interpretation. Results also show that respondents who interpret a higher likelihood of future changes to climate, based on the visualisation of climate model projections, express greater confidence in their interpretations. The findings have relevance to the climate risk community in Africa and elsewhere across the world, and imply that a na{\"{i}}ve approach to visualising climate data risks misinterpretation and unjustified levels of trust, with the potential to misinform adaptation and policy decisions.},

abstract = {Daily gridded (1o x 1o) rainfall data prepared by the India Meteorological Department for the period 1951-2004 have been used in this study to examine possible changes in the frequency of rain events in India in terms of their duration and intensity per day. So far as the duration is concerned, a rain event is classified as short, long, dry, or prolonged dry spell. Similarly in terms of intensity, a rainy day is considered as low, moderate, or heavy. Changes in the frequency of these events have great relevance from the point of view of climate change. Threshold and limiting values for defining the heavy and moderate rain days are calculated in accordance with the gamma probability distribution. Results show that the frequencies of moderate and low rain days considered over the entire country have significantly decreased in the last half century. On the basis of the duration of rain events it is inferred that long spells show a significant decreasing trend over India as a whole while short and dry spells indicate an increasing tendency with 5{\%} significance. The characteristics of rain events are also examined over six homogenous rainfall zones separately since the spatial distribution of rainfall over India shows large variability. In this study, the changes in the frequencies of different categories of rain events suggest weakening of the summer monsoon circulation over India. This hypothesis of a weakening of monsoon circulation is supported by significant reduction in the 850 hPa wind fields in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalyzed data set.

abstract = {The representation of land surface processes and fluxes in climate models critically affects the simulation of near-surface climate over land. Here we present an evaluation of COSMO-CLM2, a model which couples the COSMO-CLM Regional Climate Model to the Community Land Model (CLM4.0). CLM4.0 provides a more detailed representation of land processes compared to the native land surface scheme in COSMO-CLM. We perform historical reanalysis-driven simulations over Europe with COSMO-CLM2 following the EURO-CORDEX intercomparison protocol. We then evaluate simulations performed with COSMO-CLM2, the standard COSMO-CLM and other EURO-CORDEX RCMs against various observational datasets of temperature, precipitation and surface fluxes. Overall, the results indicate that COSMO-CLM2 outperforms both the standard COSMO-CLM and the other EURO-CORDEX models in simulating sensible, latent and surface radiative fluxes as well as 2-meter temperature across different seasons and regions. The performance improvement is particularly strong for turbulent fluxes and for daily maximum temperatures and more modest for daily minimum temperature, suggesting that land surface processes affect daytime even more than nighttime conditions. COSMO-CLM2 also alleviates a long-standing issue of overestimation of interannual summer temperature variability present in most EURO-CORDEX RCMs. Finally, we show that several factors contribute to these improvements, including the representation of evapotranspiration, radiative fluxes and ground heat flux. Overall, these results demonstrate that land processes represent a key area of development to tackle current deficiencies in RCMs.},

The principal purpose of this assessment is to provide an overview of the ability of the CMIP6 ensemble to represent the Arctic climate, and to see how this has changed since the last phase of CMIP. Overall, we find a distinct improvement in the representation of the sea ice volume and extent, the latter mostly linked to improvements in the seasonal cycle in the Barents Sea. However, numerous model biases have persisted into CMIP6 including too-cold conditions in the winter (4-K cold bias) and a negative trend in the day-to-day variability over ice in winter. We find that under the low-emission scenario, SSP126, the Arctic climate is projected to stabilize by 2060 with an annual mean sea ice extent of around 2.5 million km2 and an annual mean temperature 4.7 K warmer than the early-twentieth-century average, compared to 1.7 K of warming globally.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT For climate change scenarios, there is a high degree of complexity, with impacts on the future availability of water resources. In this context, studies related to changes in rainfall time series are essential in order to identify environmental vulnerability. The objective of this study was to analyze trends in the rainfall regime, number of rainy days and temperature for stations located at different continentality and altitude conditions in Northeast Brazil. Meteorological data of the Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia were used, being classified according to the location in relation to the continent: coastal strip (14 stations), strip of 150-300 km up to 300 m altitude (14 stations) and above 300 m (five stations), between 400 and 600 km from the coast up to 300 m (four stations) and above 300 m (eight stations). All the 45 stations used have a historical series with a data period of more than 30 years. The trend of rainfall and rainy days was obtained through the Mann-Kendall and regression analyses, at significance levels of 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. There were trends of reduction in the number of rainy days, in the coastal strip, as well as reduction in rainfall and rainy days, both in the strip of 150-300 km from the coast and in the Sert{\~{a}}o region, with no significant effect of continentality in the strip of 400-600 km from the coast. For temperature, except for Macei{\'{o}}, AL, Brazil, there is a trend of increase in near future.},

abstract = {Med-CORDEX simulations over the period 1979–2011 are evaluated with regard to their capability to represent observed decadal variations over the Euro-Mediterranean region and improve upon previous generation simulations from the ENSEMBLES project in their various experimental set-ups. Such an evaluation is needed to inform the use of these simulations and also future model development. For temperature, both Med-CORDEX and ENSEMBLES simulations tend to provide comparable results: they generally capture the sign and timing of the anomalies but not the amplitude. In general, no clear stratification appears when considering different types of Med-CORDEX regional modeling systems. Rather, it is remarkable that certain periods are poorly represented by all systems with a general underestimation of the observed long-term temperature trend, mostly in the summer season, even with respect to the corresponding global drivers. For precipitation, the Med-CORDEX simulations are closer to observations than the other datasets, with some improvement with respect to ENSEMBLES dataset. In general, all the systems experience difficulties in representing anomalies during specific periods or for specific regions. These appear in part due to limitations in the reanalysis boundary forcing data. For instance, in the second part of 1980s, the spatial patterns of surface air temperature during DJF/MAM are generally poorly represented, as well as the regionally averaged MAM/JJA surface air temperature decadal anomalies. Overall, the evaluation suggests limited improvement in Med-CORDEX simulations compared to ENSEMBLES, and a lack of sensitivity to resolution or coupling configuration, with persisting problems in part likely related to the representation of surface processes that could also affect the viability of future projections (e.g. the estimation of temperature trends). A set of decadal variability evaluation metrics, as applied in this study, could be useful in the context of a broader evaluation framework.},

In this study, the influence of climate change on TWS in Central Asia over the past decade was analyzed using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and Climatic Research Unit datasets. Results indicate that TWS experienced a decreasing trend in Central Asia from 2003 to 2013 at a rate of −4.44 ± 2.2 mm/a, and that the maximum positive anomaly for TWS (46 mm) occurred in July 2005, while the minimum negative anomaly (−32.5 mm) occurred in March 2008–August 2009. The decreasing trend of TWS in northern Central Asia (−3.86 ± 0.63 mm/a) is mainly attributed to soil moisture storage depletion, which is driven primarily by the increase in evapotranspiration. In the mountainous regions, climate change exerted an influence on TWS by affecting glaciers and snow cover change. However, human activities are now the dominant factor driving the decline of TWS in the Aral Sea region and the northern Tarim River Basin.},

abstract = {There has been much attention given to the spatial and temporal characteristics of changes in mean and extreme rainfall over Australia during the past century. As Australia is the second driest continent on Earth, reliable projections around the trends and variability in future rainfall are crucial for policymakers and water resource management. This article comprehensively reviews the current published literature on trends in Australia's rainfall from pre-instrumental and instrumental records, the climatic drivers of Australia's rainfall variability, attribution of the long-term trends, extreme rainfall attribution methods with particular reference to a recent case study (2010–2012 east Australia rainfall event) and projected changes of mean and extreme rainfall over Australia during the 21st century. Notable trends in the observational record of rainfall in Australia are a decrease in mean rainfall in southwest and southeast Australia and an increase in northwest Australia since 1950. The general consensus of research into Australia's future rainfall is that mean rainfall will continue to decrease in southwest Australia in a warming world, while changes over northern and eastern Australia remain uncertain. There are still significant knowledge gaps around the causes of observed trends in rainfall both in the mean and extremes, the ability of climate models to accurately represent rainfall in the Australian region and future rainfall projections. These gaps are identified, and avenues for future research directions are proposed. This article is categorized under: Paleoclimates and Current Trends {\textgreater} Modern Climate Change},

abstract = {In this study we evaluate the ability of an ensemble of high-resolution Regional Climate Model simulations to represent snow cover characteristics over the Australian Alps and go on to asses future projections of snowpack characteristics. Our results show that the ensemble presents a cold temperature bias and overestimates total precipitation leading to a general overestimation of the snow cover as compared with MODIS satellite data. We then produce a new set of snowpack characteristics by running a temperature based snow melt/accumulation model forced by bias corrected temperature and precipitation fields. While some positive snow cover biases remain, the bias corrected (BC) dataset show large improvements regarding the simulation of total amounts, seasonality and spatial distribution of the snow cover compared with MODIS products. Both the raw and BC datasets are then used to assess future changes in the snowpack characteristics. Both datasets show robust increases in near-surface temperatures and decreases in snowfall that lead to a substantial reduction of the snowpack over the Australian Alps. The snowpack decreases by about 15 and 60{\%} by 2030 and 2070 respectively. While the BC data introduce large differences in the simulation of the present climate snowpack, in relative terms future changes appear to be similar to those obtained using the raw data. Future temperature projections show a clear dependence with elevation through the snow-albedo feedback effect that affects snowpack projections. Uncertainties in future projections of the snowpack are large in both datasets and are mainly dominated by the choice of the lateral boundary conditions.},

abstract = {Coarse resolution global climate models (GCM) cannot resolve fine-scale drivers of regional climate, which is the scale where climate adaptation decisions are made. Regional climate models (RCMs) generate high-resolution projections by dynamically downscaling GCM outputs. However, evidence of where and when downscaling provides new information about both the current climate (added value, AV) and projected climate change signals, relative to driving data, is lacking. Seasons and locations where CORDEX-Australasia ERA- Interim and GCM-driven RCMs show AV for mean and extreme precipitation and temperature are identified. A new concept is introduced, ‘realised added value', that identifies where and when RCMs simultaneously add value in the present climate and project a different climate change signal, thus suggesting plausible improvements in future climate projections by RCMs. ERA-Interim-driven RCMs add value to the simulation of summer-time mean precipitation, especially over northern and eastern Australia. GCM- driven RCMs show AV for precipitation over complex orography in south-eastern Australia during winter and widespread AV for mean and extreme minimum temperature during both seasons, especially over coastal and high-altitude areas. RCM projections of decreased winter rainfall over the Australian Alps and decreased summer rainfall over northern Australia are collocated with notable realised added value. Realised added value averaged across models, variables, seasons and statistics is evident across the majority of Australia and shows where plausible improvements in future climate projections are conferred by RCMs. This assessment of varying RCM capabilities to provide realised added value to GCM projections can be applied globally to inform climate adaptation and model development.},

abstract = {The ability of regional climate models (RCMs) to accurately simulate current and future climate is increasingly important for impact assessment. This is the first evaluation of all reanalysis-driven RCMs within the CORDEX Australasia framework [four configurations of the Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) model, and single configurations of COSMO-CLM (CCLM) and the Conformal-Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM)] to simulate the historical climate of Australia (1981–2010) at 50 km resolution. Simulations of near-surface maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were compared with gridded observations at annual, seasonal, and daily time scales. The spatial extent, sign, and statistical significance of biases varied markedly between the RCMs. However, all RCMs showed widespread, statistically significant cold biases in maximum temperature which were the largest during winter. This bias exceeded − 5 K for some WRF configurations, and was the lowest for CCLM at ± 2 K. Most WRF configurations and CCAM simulated minimum temperatures more accurately than maximum temperatures, with biases in the range of ± 1.5 K. RCMs overestimated precipitation, especially over Australia's populous eastern seaboard. Strong negative correlations between mean monthly biases in precipitation and maximum temperature suggest that the maximum temperature cold bias is linked to precipitation overestimation. This analysis shows that the CORDEX Australasia ensemble is a valuable dataset for future impact studies, but improving the representation of land surface processes, and subsequently of surface temperatures, will improve RCM performance. The varying RCM capabilities identified here serve as a foundation for the development of future regional climate projections and impact assessments for Australia.},

Five global reanalyses products (ERA-Interim, JRA55, MERRA, CFSR and GMFD) are also included in the evaluation to assess their potential for RCM evaluation in data sparse regions. The study evaluated the means and annual anomaly distributions of indices over the 1980–2004 dataset overlap period. The results showed that RCM and reanalysis performance varied with the climate variables being evaluated. Most RCMs and reanalyses were able to simulate well climate indices related to mean air temperature and hot extremes over most of the Canadian Arctic, with the exception of the Yukon region where models displayed the largest biases related to topographic effects. Overall performance was generally poor for indices related to cold extremes. Likewise, only a few RCM simulations and reanalyses were able to provide realistic simulations of precipitation extreme indicators. The multi-reanalysis ensemble provided superior results to individual datasets for climate indicators related to mean air temperature and hot extremes, but not for other indicators. These results support the use of reanalyses as reference datasets for the evaluation of RCM mean air temperature and hot extremes over northern Canada, but not for cold extremes and precipitation indices.},

We applied a scaling approach to capture changes in climate extremes with increase in global mean temperature in several subregions within the WAF domain: Western Sahel, Central Sahel, Eastern Sahel, Guinea Coast and Central Africa including Congo Basin. While there are several uncertainties and large ensemble spread in the projections of temperature and precipitation indices, most models show high-impact changes in climate extremes at subregional scale. At these smaller scales, temperature increases within the WAF domain are projected to be higher than the global mean temperature increase (at 1.5 °C and at 2 °C) and heat waves are expected to be more frequent and of longer duration. The most intense warming is observed over the drier regions of the Sahel, in the central Sahel and particularly in the eastern Sahel, where the precipitation and the soil moisture anomalies have the highest probability of projected increase at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Over the wetter regions of the Guinea Coast and Central Africa, models project a weak change in total precipitation and a decrease of the length of wet spells, while these two regions have the highest increase of heavy rainfall in the WAF domain at a global warming of 1.5 °C. Western Sahel is projected by 80{\%} of the models to experience the strongest drying with a significant increase in the length of dry spells and a decrease in the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index. This study suggests that the ‘dry gets drier, wet gets wetter' paradigm is not valid within the WAF domain.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An ensemble of regional climate change scenarios for the North Sea is validated and analyzed. Five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs) using three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) have been downscaled with the coupled atmosphere–ice–ocean model RCA4-NEMO. Validation of sea surface temperature (SST) against different datasets suggests that the model results are well within the spread of observational datasets. The ensemble mean SST with a bias of less than 1 ∘ C is the solution that fits the observations best and underlines the importance of ensemble modeling. The exchange of momentum, heat, and freshwater between atmosphere and ocean in the regional, coupled model compares well with available datasets. The climatological seasonal cycles of these fluxes are within the 95{\%} confidence limits of the datasets. Towards the end of the 21st century the projected North Sea SST increases by 1.5 ∘ C (RCP 2.6), 2 ∘ C (RCP 4.5), and 4 ∘ C (RCP 8.5), respectively. Under this change the North Sea develops a specific pattern of the climate change signal for the air–sea temperature difference and latent heat flux in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In the RCP 8.5 scenario the amplitude of the spatial heat flux anomaly increases to 5 W/m 2 at the end of the century. Different hypotheses are discussed that could contribute to the spatially non-uniform change in air–sea interaction. The most likely cause for an increased latent heat loss in the central western North Sea is a drier atmosphere towards the end of the century. Drier air in the lee of the British Isles affects the balance of the surface heat budget of the North Sea. This effect is an example of how regional characteristics modulate global climate change. For climate change projections on regional scales it is important to resolve processes and feedbacks at regional scales.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Snow accumulation is critical for water availability in the Northern Hemisphere, raising concern that global warming could have important impacts on natural and human systems in snow-dependent regions. Although regional hydrologic changes have been observed (for example, refs,), the time of emergence of extreme changes in snow accumulation and melt remains a key unknown for assessing climate-change impacts. We find that the CMIP5 global climate model ensemble exhibits an imminent shift towards low snow years in the Northern Hemisphere, with areas of western North America, northeastern Europe and the Greater Himalaya showing the strongest emergence during the near-term decades and at 2C global warming. The occurrence of extremely low snow years becomes widespread by the late twenty-first century, as do the occurrences of extremely high early-season snowmelt and runoff (implying increasing flood risk), and extremely low late-season snowmelt and runoff (implying increasing water stress). Our results suggest that many snow-dependent regions of the Northern Hemisphere are likely to experience increasing stress from low snow years within the next three decades, and from extreme changes in snow-dominated water resources if global warming exceeds 2C above the pre-industrial baseline. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Efforts to understand the influence of historical global warming on individual extreme climate events have increased over the past decade. However, despite substantial progress, events that are unprecedented in the local observational record remain a persistent challenge. Leveraging observations and a large climate model ensemble, we quantify uncertainty in the influence of global warming on the severity and probability of the historically hottest month, hottest day, driest year, and wettest 5-d period for different areas of the globe. We find that historical warming has increased the severity and probability of the hottest month and hottest day of the year at {\textgreater}80{\%} of the available observational area. Our framework also suggests that the historical climate forcing has increased the probability of the driest year and wettest 5-d period at 57{\%} and 41{\%} of the observed area, respectively, although we note important caveats. For the most protracted hot and dry events, the strongest and most widespread contributions of anthropogenic climate forcing occur in the tropics, including increases in probability of at least a factor of 4 for the hottest month and at least a factor of 2 for the driest year. We also demonstrate the ability of our framework to systematically evaluate the role of dynamic and thermodynamic factors such as atmospheric circulation patterns and atmospheric water vapor, and find extremely high statistical confidence that anthropogenic forcing increased the probability of record-low Arctic sea ice extent.},

In a CMIP5 multimodel analysis, the annual cycles of temperature and precipitation simulated by HadGEM2-ES were very close to the multimodel ensemble mean. HadGEM2-ES temperature simulation compares well with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis over the 1979-2004 periods, except for a summer overestimation in Central Africa, and a winter underestimation in tropical West Africa. The precipitation simulation compared well with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data from 1979 to 2004 over the entire Africa, except in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where the model fails to capture adequately the transition phase of the monsoon circulation. The dry regimes over Northern Africa as well as the wetter regime occurring over Central Africa, which is mainly regulated by the ITCZ displacement, and during the austral summer of Southern Africa, are also fairly reproduced by the HadGEM2-ES model. The model projects for the end of the 21st century a rainy South Africa, a change of the flood/drought cycle in the Tropics and a warming over the whole continent, varying from 3 to 7°C. HadGEM2-ES performance for Nigeria shows good reproduction of precipitation seasonal cycles for some locations, outside the ITCZ. However, the comparison with in situ measurement in Ilorin and Lagos shows the model is not being able to reproduce the precipitation annual cycle. Future projections for Nigeria exhibit warming everywhere and an enhancement of precipitation, especially in the northern part of the country.},

abstract = {Abstract The climate response of the equatorial Pacific to increased greenhouse gases is investigated using numerical experiments from 11 climate models participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change?s Fourth Assessment Report. Multimodel mean climate responses to CO2 doubling are identified and related to changes in the heat budget of the surface layer. Weaker ocean surface currents driven by a slowing down of the Walker circulation reduce ocean dynamical cooling throughout the equatorial Pacific. The combined anomalous ocean dynamical plus radiative heating from CO2 is balanced by different processes in the western and eastern basins: Cloud cover feedbacks and evaporation balance the heating over the warm pool, while increased cooling by ocean vertical heat transport balances the warming over the cold tongue. This increased cooling by vertical ocean heat transport arises from increased near-surface thermal stratification, despite a reduction in vertical velocity. The stratification response is found to be a permanent feature of the equilibrium climate potentially linked to both thermodynamical and dynamical changes within the equatorial Pacific. Briefly stated, ocean dynamical changes act to reduce (enhance) the net heating in the east (west). This explains why the models simulate enhanced equatorial warming, rather than El Ni{\~{n}}o?like warming, in response to a weaker Walker circulation. To conclude, the implications for detecting these signals in the modern observational record are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a concise summary of the studies on interdecadal variability of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) from three main perspectives. (1) The EAWM has been significantly affected by global climate change. Winter temperature in China has experienced three stages of variations from the beginning of the 1950s: a cold period (from the beginning of the 1950s to the early or mid 1980s), a warm period (from the early or mid 1980s to the early 2000s), and a hiatus period in recent 10 years (starting from 1998). The strength of the EAWM has also varied in three stages: a stronger winter monsoon period (1950 to 1986/87), a weaker period (1986/87 to 2004/05), and a strengthening period (from 2005). (2) Corresponding to the interdecadal variations of the EAWM, the East Asian atmospheric circulation, winter temperature of China, and the occurrence of cold waves over China have all exhibited coherent interdecadal variability. The upper-level zonal circulation was stronger, the mid-tropospheric trough over East Asia was deeper with stronger downdrafts behind the trough, and the Siberian high was stronger during the cold period than during the warm period. (3) The interdecadal variations of the EAWM seem closely related to major modes of variability in the atmospheric circulation and the Pacific sea surface temperature. When the Northern Hemisphere annular mode/Arctic Oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation were in negative (positive) phase, the EAWM was stronger (weaker), leading to colder (warmer) temperatures in China. In addition, the negative (positive) phase of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation coincided with relatively cold (warm) temperatures and stronger (weaker) EAWMs. It is thus inferred that the interdecadal variations in the ocean may be one of the most important natural factors influencing long-term variability in the EAWM. although global warming may have also played a significant role in weakening the EAWM.},

abstract = {A workshop was held in Casablanca, Morocco, in March 2012, to enhance knowledge of climate extremes and their changes in the Arab region. This workshop initiated intensive data compilation activities of daily observational weather station data from the Arab region. After conducting careful control processes to ensure the quality and homogeneity of the data, climate indices for extreme temperatures and precipitation were calculated. This study examines the temporal changes in climate extremes in the Arab region with regard to long-term trends and natural variability related to ENSO and NAO. We find consistent warming trends since the middle of the 20th Century across the region. This is evident in the increased frequencies of warm days and warm nights, higher extreme temperature values, fewer cold days and cold nights and shorter cold spell durations. The warming trends seem to be particularly strong since the early 1970s. Changes in precipitation are generally less consistent and characterised by a higher spatial and temporal variability; the trends are generally less significant. However, in the western part of the Arab region, there is a tendency towards wetter conditions. In contrast, in the eastern part, there are more drying trends, although, these are of low significance. We also find some relationships between climate extremes in the Arab region and certain prominent modes of variability, in particular El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The relationships of the climate extremes with NAO are stronger, in general, than those with ENSO, and are particularly strong in the western part of the Arab region (closer to the Atlantic Ocean). The relationships with ENSO are found to be more significant towards the eastern part of the area of study. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Analysis of observations indicates that there was a rapid increase in summer (June–August) mean surface air temperature (SAT) since the mid-1990s over Western Europe. Accompanying this rapid warming are significant increases in summer mean daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, annual hottest day temperature and warmest night temperature, and an increase in frequency of summer days and tropical nights, while the change in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) is small. This study focuses on understanding causes of the rapid summer warming and associated temperature extreme changes. A set of experiments using the atmospheric component of the state-of-the-art HadGEM3 global climate model have been carried out to quantify relative roles of changes in sea surface temperature (SST)/sea ice extent (SIE), anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), and anthropogenic aerosols (AAer). Results indicate that the model forced by changes in all forcings reproduces many of the observed changes since the mid-1990s over Western Europe. Changes in SST/SIE explain 62.2 ± 13.0 {\%} of the area averaged seasonal mean warming signal over Western Europe, with the remaining 37.8 ± 13.6 {\%} of the warming explained by the direct impact of changes in GHGs and AAer. Results further indicate that the direct impact of the reduction of AAer precursor emissions over Europe, mainly through aerosol-radiation interaction with additional contributions from aerosol-cloud interaction and coupled atmosphere-land surface feedbacks, is a key factor for increases in annual hottest day temperature and in frequency of summer days. It explains 45.5 ± 17.6 {\%} and 40.9 ± 18.4 {\%} of area averaged signals for these temperature extremes. The direct impact of the reduction of AAer precursor emissions over Europe acts to increase DTR locally, but the change in DTR is countered by the direct impact of GHGs forcing. In the next few decades, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise and AAer precursor emissions over Europe and North America will continue to decline. Our results suggest that the changes in summer seasonal mean SAT and temperature extremes over Western Europe since the mid-1990s are most likely to be sustained or amplified in the near term, unless other factors intervene.},

At the regional scale, all reanalysis datasets perform more poorly for the magnitude, but better for their year-to-year changes in wind regimes in the escarpment than the coastal and plateau regions. By comparison, ERA5 has the best performance for the monthly averaged wind speed magnitude and the interannual variability of the near-surface wind speed from 1979 onward. Intercomparison exhibits high and significant correlations for annual and seasonal wind speed Antarctic-wide averages from different datasets during their overlapping timespans (1980–2018), despite some regional disagreements between the different reanalyses. Furthermore, all of the reanalyses show positive trends of the annual and summer wind speeds for the 1980–2018 period, which are linked with positive polarity of the southern annular mode.},

abstract = {Abstract Based on high-resolution models, we investigate the change in climate extremes and impact-relevant indicators over Europe under different levels of global warming. We specifically assess the robustness of the changes and the benefits of limiting warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C. Compared to 1.5°C world, a further 0.5°C warming results in a robust change of minimum summer temperature indices (mean, Tn10p, and Tn900p) over more than 70{\%} of Europe. Robust changes (more than 0.5°C) in maximum temperature affect smaller areas (usually less than 20{\%}). There is a substantial nonlinear change of fixed-threshold indices, with more than 60{\%} increase of the number of tropical nights over southern Europe and more than 50{\%} decrease in the number of frost days over central Europe. The change in mean precipitation due to 0.5°C warming is mostly nonsignificant at the grid point level, but, locally, it is accompanied by a more marked change in extreme rainfall.},

abstract = {Statistical bias-adjustment of climate models' outputs is being increasingly used for assessing the impact of climate change on several sectors. It is known that these techniques may alter the mean climate signal of the adjusted variable; however, the effect on the projected occurrence of climate extremes is less commonly investigated. Here the outputs of an ensemble of high-resolution (0.11°) regional climate models (RCM) from the Coordinated Regional-climate Downscaling Experiment for Europe (EURO-CORDEX) have been bias adjusted, and a number of climate indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices have been calculated for the present (1981-2010) and future (2071-2100) climate. Indices include absolute-thresholds indices, percentile-based indices, and indices based on the duration of an event. Results show that absolute-threshold indices are largely affected by bias adjustment, as they depend strongly on both the present mean climate value (usually largely biased in the original RCMs) and its shift under climate change. The change of percentile-based indices is less affected by bias adjustment, as that of indices based on the duration of an event (e.g., consecutive dry days or heat waves) although the present climate value can differ between original and bias-adjusted results. Indices like R95ptot (the total amount of precipitation larger than the 95th reference percentile) are largely affected by bias adjustment, although, when analyzing an ensemble of RCMs, the differences are usually smaller than, or comparable to, the intermodel variability.},

abstract = {In the framework of the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (CORDEX), an ensemble of climate change projections for Africa has been created by downscaling the simulations of four global climate models (GCMs) by means of the consortium for small-scale modeling (COSMO) regional climate model (RCM) (COSMO-CLM, hereafter, CCLM). Differences between the projected temperature and precipitation simulated by CCLM and the driving GCMs are analyzed and discussed. The projected increase of seasonal temperature is found to be relatively similar between GCMs and RCM, although large differences (more than 1 °C) exist locally. Differences are also found for extreme-event related quantities, such as the spread of the upper end of the maximum temperature probability distribution function and, in turn, the duration of heat waves. Larger uncertainties are found in the future precipitation changes; this is partly a consequence of the inter-model (GCMs) variability over some areas (e.g. Sahel). However, over other regions (e.g. Central Africa) the rainfall trends simulated by CCLM and the GCMs show opposite signs, with CCLM showing a significant reduction in precipitation at the end of the century. This uncertain and sometimes contrasting behaviour is further investigated by analyzing the different models' response to the land–atmosphere interaction and feedback. Given the large uncertainty associated with inter-model variability across GCMs and the reduced spread in the results when a single RCM is used for downscaling, we strongly emphasize the importance of exploiting fully the CORDEX-Africa multi-GCM/multi-RCM ensemble in order to assess the robustness of the climate change signal and, possibly, to identify and quantify the many sources of uncertainty that still remain.},

abstract = {Estimating the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) in mountainous terrain is currently the most important unsolved problem in snow hydrology. Several methods can estimate the amount of snow throughout a mountain range: (1) Spatial interpolation from surface sensors constrained by remotely sensed snow extent provides a consistent answer, with uncertainty related to extrapolation to unrepresented locations. (2) The remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow is combined with a melt calculation to reconstruct the SWE back to the last significant snowfall. (3) Passive microwave sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several problems like subpixel variability in the mountains. (4) A numerical model combined with assimilated surface observations produces SWE at 1-km resolution at continental scales, but depends heavily on a surface network. (5) New methods continue to be explored, for example, airborne LiDAR altimetry provides direct measurements of snow depth, which are combined with modelled snow density to estimate SWE. While the problem is aggressively addressed, the right answer remains elusive. Good characterization of the snow is necessary to make informed choices about water resources and adaptation to climate change and variability. WIREs Water 2016, 3:461–474. doi: 10.1002/wat2.1140.

Among them ammonium and nitrate (A{\&}amp;N) aerosols may have a growing impact on regional climate. In this study, their representation in coarse and fine modes has been introduced in the prognostic aerosol scheme of the ALADIN-Climate regional model. This new aerosol scheme is evaluated over Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, using two twin simulations over the period 1979–2016 with and without A{\&}amp;N aerosols. This evaluation is performed at local and regional scales, using surface stations and satellite measurements. Despite an overestimate of the surface nitrate concentration, the model is able to reproduce its spatial pattern including local maxima (Benelux, Po Valley). Concerning the simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD), the inclusion of A{\&}amp;N aerosols significantly reduces the model bias compared to both AERONET stations and satellite data. Our results indicate that A{\&}amp;N aerosols can contribute up to 40{\&}thinsp;{\%} of the total AOD{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}550{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} over Europe, with an average of 0.07 (550{\&}thinsp;nm) over the period 2001–2016. Sensitivity studies suggest that biases still present are related to uncertainties associated with the annual cycle of A{\&}amp;N aerosol precursors (ammonia and nitric acid). The decrease in sulfate aerosol production over Europe since 1980 produces more free ammonia in the atmosphere leading to an increase in A{\&}amp;N concentrations over the studied period. Analyses of the different aerosol trends have shown for the first time to our knowledge that, since 2005 over Europe, A{\&}amp;N AOD{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}550{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} and A{\&}amp;N shortwave (SW) direct radiative forcing (DRF) are found to be higher than sulfate and organics, making these the species with the highest AOD and the highest DRF.

abstract = {Annual and seasonal precipitation amounts and annual precipitation extreme indices for Japan were characterized for the period 1901–2012 using the Mann–Kendall Tau test, regional analysis, and probability distribution functions, and possible correlations with climate indices including the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and the sea surface temperature were explored using wavelet analysis. The results indicate that precipitation amounts exhibited a substantial decrease at both the annual and seasonal scales, and the fluctuation became more frequent and stronger in the recent decades. Precipitation tended to be concentrated in summer and autumn throughout Japan and the southwest had higher precipitation than the southeast in the spring, summer, and autumn, with precipitation concentrated in the southeast in the winter. On a regional scale, the number of heavy precipitation days, consecutive wet days and total wet-day precipitation indicated a decreasing trend, while an increasing trend for maximum 1- and 5-day precipitation amount, precipitation in very wet days and the number of consecutive dry days. These changes have been an important issue for supplying the demand of water resources in Japan. Continuous wavelet analysis shows that there were significant periodic variations at 2–3 and 5–13 years frequency in extreme precipitation. In addition, climate indices have significant correlations with extreme precipitation, for example, there is statistically significant association between the increasing extreme precipitation and SOI.},

abstract = {Changes in the seasonality of precipitation over Africa have high potential for detrimental socioeconomic impacts due to high societal dependence upon seasonal rainfall. Here, for the first time we conduct a continental-scale analysis of changes in wet season characteristics under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate projection scenarios across an ensemble of CMIP5 models using an objective methodology to determine the onset and cessation of the wet season. A delay in the wet season over West Africa and the Sahel of over 5–10 days on average, and later onset of the wet season over southern Africa, is identified and associated with increasing strength of the Saharan heat low in late boreal summer and a northward shift in the position of the tropical rain belt over August–December. Over the Horn of Africa rainfall during the “short rains” season is projected to increase by over 100 mm on average by the end of the twenty-first century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Average rainfall per rainy day is projected to increase, while the number of rainy days in the wet season declines in regions of stable or declining rainfall (western and southern Africa) and remains constant in central Africa, where rainfall is projected to increase. Adaptation strategies should account for shorter wet seasons, increasing rainfall intensity, and decreasing rainfall frequency, which will have implications for crop yields and surface water supplies.},

abstract = {Previously unknown foehn jets have been identified to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) above the Larsen C Ice Shelf. These jets have major implications for the east coast of the AP, a region of rapid climatic warming and where two large sections of ice shelf have collapsed in recent years. During three foehn events across the AP, leeside warming and drying is seen in new aircraft observations and simulated well by the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) at ∼1.5 km grid spacing. In case A, weak southwesterly flow and an elevated upwind inversion characterise a highly nonlinear flow regime with upwind flow blocking. In case C strong northwesterly winds characterise a relatively linear case with little upwind flow blocking. Case B resides somewhere between the two in flow regime linearity. The foehn jets - apparent in aircraft observations where available and MetUM simulations of all three cases - are mesoscale features (up to 60 km in width) originating from the mouths of leeside inlets. Through back trajectory analysis they are identified as a type of gap flow. In cases A and B the jets are distinct, being strongly accelerated relative to the background flow, and confined to low levels above the Larsen C Ice Shelf. They resemble the 'shallow foehn' of the Alps. Case C resembles a case of 'deep foehn', with the jets less distinct. The foehn jets are considerably cooler and moister relative to adjacent regions of calmer foehn air. This is due to a dampened foehn effect in the jet regions: in case A the jets have lower upwind source regions, and in the more linear case C there is less diabatic warming and precipitation along jet trajectories due to the reduced orographic uplift across the mountain passes.},

The seasonal climatology, annual rainfall cycles, and interannual variability of RCM output have been assessed over three homogeneous subregions against a number of observational datasets. The ability of the RCMs in simulating large-scale global climate forcing signals is further assessed by compositing the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events. It is found that most RCMs reasonably simulate the main features of the rainfall climatology over the three subregions and also reproduce the majority of the documented regional responses to ENSO and IOD forcings. At the same time the analysis shows significant biases in individual models depending on subregion and season; however, the ensemble mean has better agreement with observation than individual models.

abstract = {The ability of climate models to simulate atmospheric teleconnections provides an important basis for the use and analysis of climate change projections. This study examines the ability of COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment models, with lateral and surface boundary conditions derived from Coupled Global Climate Models (CGCMs), to simulate the teleconnections between tropical sea surface temperatures and rainfall over Eastern Africa. The ability of the models to simulate the associated changes in atmospheric circulation patterns over the region is also assessed. The models used in the study are Rossby Centre regional atmospheric model (RCA) driven by eight CGCMs and COnsortium for Small scale MOdeling (COSMO) Climate Limited-area Modelling (COSMO-CLM or CCLM) driven by four of the same CGCMs. Teleconnection patterns are examined using correlation, regression and composite analysis. In order to identify the source of the errors, CGCM-driven regional climate model (RCM) results are compared with ERA-Interim driven RCM results. Results from the driving CGCMs are also analyzed. The RCMs driven by reanalysis (quasi-perfect boundary conditions) successfully capture rainfall teleconnections in most examined regions and seasons. Our analysis indicates that most of the errors in simulating the teleconnection patterns come from the driving CGCMs. RCMs driven by MPI-ESM-LR, HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M tend to perform relatively better than RCMs driven by other CGCMs. CanESM2 and MIROC5, and their corresponding downscaled results capture the teleconnections in most of the sub-regions and seasons poorly. This highlights the relative importance of CGCM-derived boundary conditions in the downscaled product and the need to improve these as well as the RCMs themselves. Overall, the results produced here will be very useful in identifying and selecting CGCMs and RCMs for the use of climate change projecting over the Eastern Africa.},

AMO warm phases occurred during 1860–1880 and 1940–1960, and cool phases during 1905–1925 and 1970–1990. The signal is global in scope, with a positively correlated co-oscillation in parts of the North Pacific, but it is most intense in the North Atlantic and covers the entire basin there. During AMO warmings most of the United States sees less than normal rainfall, including Midwest droughts in the 1930s and 1950s. Between AMO warm and cool phases, Mississippi River outflow varies by 10{\%} while the inflow to Lake Okeechobee, Florida varies by 40{\%}. The geographical pattern of variability is influenced mainly by changes in summer rainfall. The winter patterns of interannual rainfall variability associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation are also significantly changed between AMO phases.},

The results indicate a change from surface mass loss that prevailed in the region during the first decade of the 21st century to predominantly positive surface mass balance after 2009/10. The spatial pattern of annual surface mass-balance distribution implies snow redistribution by wind on both glaciers. The mean equilibrium line altitudes for Whisky Glacier (311 ± 16 m a.s.l.) and Davies Dome (393 ± 18 m a.s.l.) are in accordance with the regional data indicating 200-300 m higher equilibrium line on James Ross and Vega Islands compared with the South Shetland Islands. The mean accumulation-area ratio of 0.68 ± 0.09 and 0.44 ± 0.09 determined for Whisky Glacier and Davies Dome, respectively, is similar to the value reported for Vega Island and within the range of typical values for high-latitude glaciers.},

abstract = {An analysis of observed trends in African annual-average near-surface temperatures over the last five decades reveals drastic increases, particularly over parts of the subtropics and central tropical Africa. Over these regions, temperatures have been rising at more than twice the global rate of temperature increase. An ensemble of high-resolution downscalings, obtained using a single regional climate model forced with the sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice fields of an ensemble of global circulation model (GCM) simulations, is shown to realistically represent the relatively strong temperature increases observed in subtropical southern and northern Africa. The amplitudes of warming are generally underestimated, however. Further warming is projected to occur during the 21st century, with plausible increases of 4–6 °C over the subtropics and 3–5 °C over the tropics by the end of the century relative to present-day climate under the A2 (a low mitigation) scenario of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios. High impact climate events such as heat-wave days and high fire-danger days are consistently projected to increase drastically in their frequency of occurrence. General decreases in soil-moisture availability are projected, even for regions where increases in rainfall are plausible, due to enhanced levels of evaporation. The regional dowscalings presented here, and recent GCM projections obtained for Africa, indicate that African annual-averaged temperatures may plausibly rise at about 1.5 times the global rate of temperature increase in the subtropics, and at a somewhat lower rate in the tropics. These projected increases although drastic, may be conservative given the model underestimations of observed temperature trends. The relatively strong rate of warming over Africa, in combination with the associated increases in extreme temperature events, may be key factors to consider when interpreting the suitability of global mitigation targets in terms of African climate change and climate change adaptation in Africa.},

abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

abstract = {Surface air temperature outputs from 16 global climate models participating in the sixth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) were used to evaluate agreement with observations over the global land surface for the period 1901–2014. Projections of multi-model mean under four different shared socioeconomic pathways were also examined. The results reveal that the majority of models reasonably capture the dominant features of the spatial variations in observed temperature with a pattern correlation typically greater than 0.98, but with large variability across models and regions. In addition, the CMIP6 mean can capture the trends of global surface temperatures shown by the observational data during 1901–1940 (warming), 1941–1970 (cooling) and 1971–2014 (rapid warming). By the end of the 21st century, the global temperature under different scenarios is projected to increase by 1.18 ◦C/100 yr (SSP1-2.6), 3.22 ◦C/100 yr (SSP2-4.5), 5.50 ◦C/100 yr (SSP3-7.0) and 7.20 ◦C/100 yr (SSP5-8.5), with greater warming projected over the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere and weaker warming over the tropics and the southern hemisphere. Results of probability density distributions further indicate that large increases in the frequency and magnitude of warm extremes over the global land may occur in the future.},

abstract = {The surface snow density of glaciers and ice sheets is of fundamental importance in converting volume to mass in both altimetry and surface mass balance studies, yet it is often poorly constrained. Site-specific surface snow densities are typically derived from empirical relations based on temperature and wind speed. These parameterizations commonly calculate the average density of the top meter of snow, thereby systematically overestimating snow density at the actual surface. Therefore, constraining surface snow density to the top 0.1 m can improve boundary conditions in high-resolution firn-evolution modeling. We have compiled an extensive dataset of 200 point measurements of surface snow density from firn cores and snow pits on the Greenland ice sheet. We find that surface snow density within 0.1 m of the surface has an average value of 315 kg m−3 with a standard deviation of 44 kg m−3, and has an insignificant annual air temperature dependency. We demonstrate that two widely-used surface snow density parameterizations dependent on temperature systematically overestimate surface snow density over the Greenland ice sheet by 17–19{\%}, and that using a constant density of 315 kg m−3 may give superior results when applied in surface mass budget modeling.},

This multi-MIP ensemble includes all regional climate model (RCM) projections publicly available to date, along with their driving global climate models (GCMs). We illustrate consistent and conflicting messages using continental Spain and the Balearic Islands as target region. The study considers near future (2021–2050) changes and their dependence on several uncertainty sources sampled in the multi-MIP ensemble: GCM, future scenario, internal variability, RCM, and spatial resolution. This initial work focuses on mean seasonal precipitation and temperature changes. The results show that the potential GCM–RCM combinations have been explored very unevenly, with favoured GCMs and large ensembles of a few RCMs that do not respond to any ensemble design. Therefore, the grand-ensemble is weighted towards a few models. The selection of a balanced, credible sub-ensemble is challenged in this study by illustrating several conflicting responses between the RCM and its driving GCM and among different RCMs. Sub-ensembles from different initiatives are dominated by different uncertainty sources, being the driving GCM the main contributor to uncertainty in the grand-ensemble. For this analysis of the near future changes, the emission scenario does not lead to a strong uncertainty. Despite the extra computational effort, for mean seasonal changes, the increase in resolution does not lead to important changes.},

abstract = {Global Climate Models (GCMs) generally exhibit significant biases in the representation of large-scale atmospheric circulation. Even after a sensible bias adjustment these errors remain and are inherited to some extent by the derived downscaling products, impairing the credibility of future regional projections. In this study we perform a process-based evaluation of state-of-the-art GCMs from CMIP5 and CMIP6, with a focus on the simulation of the synoptic climatological patterns having a most prominent effect on the European climate. To this aim, we use the Lamb Weather Type Classification (LWT, Lamb British isles weather types and a register of the daily sequence 736 of circulation patterns 1861-1971. METEOROL OFF, GEOPHYS MEM; 737 GB; DA 1972; NO 116; PP 1-85; BIBL 2P1/2, 1972), a subjective classification of circulation weather types constructed upon historical simulations of daily mean sea level pressure. Observational uncertainty has been taken into account by considering four different reanalysis products of varying characteristics. Our evaluation unveils an overall improvement of salient atmospheric circulation features consistent across observational references, although this is uneven across models and large frequency biases still remain for the main LWTs. Some CMIP6 models attain similar or even worse results than their CMIP5 counterparts, although in most cases consistent improvements have been found, demonstrating the ability of the new models to better capture key synoptic conditions. In light of the large differences found across models, we advocate for a careful selection of driving GCMs in downscaling experiments with a special focus on large-scale atmospheric circulation aspects.},

abstract = {Purpose Climate data, including historical climate observations and climate model outputs, are often used in climate impact assessments, to explore potential climate futures. However, characteristics often associated with “islandness”, such as smallness, land boundedness and isolation, may mean that climate impact assessment methods applied at broader scales cannot simply be downscaled to island settings. This paper aims to discuss information needs and the limitations of climate models and datasets in the context of small islands and explores how such challenges might be addressed.Design/methodology/approach Reviewing existing literature, this paper explores challenges of islandness in top-down, model-led climate impact assessment and bottom-up, vulnerability-led approaches. It examines how alternative forms of knowledge production can play a role in validating models and in guiding adaptation actions at the local level and highlights decision-making techniques that can support adaptation even when data is uncertain.Findings Small island topography is often too detailed for global or even regional climate models to resolve, but equally, local meteorological station data may be absent or uncertain, particularly in island peripheries. However, rather than viewing the issue as decision-making with big data at the regional/global scale versus with little or no data at the small island scale, a more productive discourse can emerge by conceptualising strategies of decision-making with unconventional types of data.Originality/value This paper provides a critical overview and synthesis of issues relating to climate models, data sets and impact assessment methods as they pertain to islands, which can benefit decision makers and other end-users of climate data in island communities.},

abstract = {Majuro is a low-lying island perched on a coral atoll in the central Pacific Ocean and is home to nearly 28,000 people. Considered highly vulnerable to the impacts of marine inundation, Majuro is expected to experience increasingly severe inundation as a result of continued sea-level rise. Popular media, academic papers, government reports, disaster declarations and other online resources are used to document 18 inundation events at Majuro over the past 36 years, which caused considerable impact to local physical and anthropogenic systems. The physical drivers and impacts of the documented inundation events are examined using tide gauge and weather observations and wave model hindcasts. The ocean-facing shorelines of Majuro experience frequent inundation caused by swell waves generated by distant storms from both the north and the south Pacific Ocean. In some instances, complete overwashing of the island by swell waves has been reported. Less frequent, although potentially far more damaging, are inundation events associated with typhoons and tropical storms, with the most recent in 1997. Inundation along the sheltered lagoon-facing shoreline of Majuro has occurred in the absence of waves due to the coincidence of high sea levels during La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions and seasonally high tides, as in 2011. Lagoon inundation also appears to have been caused by offshore swell penetrating into the lagoon, most effectively at high tide, and by locally generated wind waves within the lagoon. The classes of inundation identified in this study have unique drivers and the impacts have varying spatial and temporal characteristics in terms of impact and predictability. The inundation events are discussed with respect to the drivers of inundation and the future outlook under rising sea-level conditions.},

abstract = {Arctic warming is one of the most striking signals of global warming. The Arctic is one of the fastest warming regions on Earth and constitutes, thus, a good test bed to evaluate the ability of climate models to reproduce the physics and dynamics involved in Arctic warming. Different physical and dynamical mechanisms have been proposed to explain Arctic amplification. These mechanisms include the surface albedo feedback and poleward sensible and latent heat transport processes. During the winter season when Arctic amplification is most pronounced, the first mechanism relies on an enhancement in upward surface heat flux, while the second mechanism does not. In these mechanisms, it has been proposed that downward infrared radiation (IR) plays a role to a varying degree. Here, we show that the current generation of CMIP5 climate models all reproduce Arctic warming and there are high pattern correlations—typically greater than 0.9—between the surface air temperature (SAT) trend and the downward IR trend. However, we find that there are two groups of CMIP5 models: one with small pattern correlations between the Arctic SAT trend and the surface vertical heat flux trend (Group 1), and the other with large correlations (Group 2) between the same two variables. The Group 1 models exhibit higher pattern correlations between Arctic SAT and 500 hPa geopotential height trends, than do the Group 2 models. These findings suggest that Arctic warming in Group 1 models is more closely related to changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation, whereas in Group 2, the albedo feedback effect plays a more important role. Interestingly, while Group 1 models have a warm or weak bias in their Arctic SAT, Group 2 models show large cold biases. This stark difference in model bias leads us to hypothesize that for a given model, the dominant Arctic warming mechanism and trend may be dependent on the bias of the model mean state.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Spatial patterns of rainfall in Hawai‘i are among the most diverse in the world. As the global climate warms, it is important to understand observed rainfall variations to provide context for future changes. This is especially important for isolated oceanic islands where freshwater resources are limited, and understanding the potential impacts of climate change on the supply of freshwater is critical. Utilizing a high-resolution gridded data set of monthly and annual rainfall for Hawai‘i from January 1920 to December 2012, seasonal and annual trends were calculated for every 250-m pixel across the state and mapped to produce spatially continuous trend maps. To assess the stability of these trends, a running trend analysis was performed on 34 selected stations. From 1920 to 2012, over 90{\%} of the state experienced drying trends, with Hawai‘i Island, and in particular the western part of the island, experiencing the largest significant long-term declines in annual and dry season rainfall. The running trend analysis highlighted the multi-decadal variability present in these trends, and revealed that the only region in the state with persistent annual and dry season trends through the study period is the western part of Hawai‘i Island; for most other regions, the drying trends were not significant until the most recent part of the record was included. These results support previous studies that indicate drying across the state over recent decades, and reveal the timing of upward and downward trends as well as important spatial details for natural resource management in Hawai‘i.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Twenty-first century snowfall changes over the European Alps are assessed based on high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) data made available through the EURO-CORDEX initiative. Fourteen different combinations of global and regional climate models with a target resolution of 12 km and two different emission scenarios are considered. As raw snowfall amounts are not provided by all RCMs, a newly developed method to separate snowfall from total precipitation based on near-surface temperature conditions and accounting for subgrid-scale topographic variability is employed. The evaluation of the simulated snowfall amounts against an observation-based reference indicates the ability of RCMs to capture the main characteristics of the snowfall seasonal cycle and its elevation dependency but also reveals considerable positive biases especially at high elevations. These biases can partly be removed by the application of a dedicated RCM bias adjustment that separately considers temperature and precipitation biases.Snowfall projections reveal a robust signal of decreasing snowfall amounts over most parts of the Alps for both emission scenarios. Domain and multi-model mean decreases in mean September–May snowfall by the end of the century amount to −25 and −45 {\%} for representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Snowfall in low-lying areas in the Alpine forelands could be reduced by more than −80 {\%}. These decreases are driven by the projected warming and are strongly connected to an important decrease in snowfall frequency and snowfall fraction and are also apparent for heavy snowfall events. In contrast, high-elevation regions could experience slight snowfall increases in midwinter for both emission scenarios despite the general decrease in the snowfall fraction. These increases in mean and heavy snowfall can be explained by a general increase in winter precipitation and by the fact that, with increasing temperatures, climatologically cold areas are shifted into a temperature interval which favours higher snowfall intensities. In general, percentage changes in snowfall indices are robust with respect to the RCM postprocessing strategy employed: similar results are obtained for raw, separated, and separated–bias-adjusted snowfall amounts. Absolute changes, however, can differ among these three methods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Global climate models suggest that Antarctic snowfall should increase in a warming climate and mitigate rises in the sea level. Several processes affect surface mass balance (SMB), introducing large uncertainties in past, present and future ice sheet mass balance. To provide an extended perspective on the past SMB of Antarctica, we used 67 firn/ice core records to reconstruct the temporal variability in the SMB over the past 800 yr and, in greater detail, over the last 200 yr. Our SMB reconstructions indicate that the SMB changes over most of Antarctica are statistically negligible and that the current SMB is not exceptionally high compared to the last 800 yr. High-accumulation periods have occurred in the past, specifically during the 1370s and 1610s. However, a clear increase in accumulation of more than 10{\%} has occurred in high SMB coastal regions and over the highest part of the East Antarctic ice divide since the 1960s. To explain the differences in behaviour between the coastal/ice divide sites and the rest of Antarctica, we suggest that a higher frequency of blocking anticyclones increases the precipitation at coastal sites, leading to the advection of moist air in the highest areas, whereas blowing snow and/or erosion have significant negative impacts on the SMB at windy sites. Eight hundred years of stacked records of the SMB mimic the total solar irradiance during the 13th and 18th centuries. The link between those two variables is probably indirect and linked to a teleconnection in atmospheric circulation that forces complex feedback between the tropical Pacific and Antarctica via the generation and propagation of a large-scale atmospheric wave train. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {Projections of changes in Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) surface mass balance indicate a negative contribution to sea level because of the expected increase in precipitation due to the higher moisture holding capacity of warmer air. Observations over the past decades, however, are unable to constrain the relation between temperature and accumulation changes because both are dominated by strong natural variability. Here we derive a consistent continental-scale increase in accumulation of approximately 5 ± 1{\%} K-1, through the assessment of ice-core data (spanning the large temperature change during the last deglaciation, 21,000 to 10,000 years ago), in combination with palaeo-simulations, future projections by 35 general circulation models (GCMs), and one high-resolution future simulation. The ice-core data and modelling results for the last deglaciation agree, showing uniform local sensitivities of 46{\%} K-1. The palaeo-simulation allows for a continental-scale aggregation of accumulation changes reaching 4.3{\%} K-1. Despite the different timescales, these sensitivities agree with the multi-model mean of 6.1 ± 2.6{\%} K-1 (GCM projections) and the continental-scale sensitivity of 4.9{\%} K-1 (high-resolution future simulation). Because some of the mass gain of the AIS is offset by dynamical losses induced by accumulation, we provide a response function allowing projections of sea-level fall in terms of continental-scale accumulation changes that compete with surface melting and dynamical losses induced by other mechanisms.},

The analysis also includes the simulation of tropical cyclones. It is found that RegCM4 reproduces adequately the mean spatial patterns of seasonal precipitation and temperature, along with the associated interannual variability characteristics. The main model bias is an overestimation of precipitation in mountainous regions. The 5 and 95 percentiles of daily temperature, as well as the maximum dry spell length are realistically simulated. The simulated distribution of precipitation events as well as the 95 percentile of precipitation shows a wet bias in topographically complex regions. Based on a simple detection method, the model produces realistic tropical cyclone distributions even at its relatively coarse resolution (dx = 50 km), although the number of cyclone days is underestimated over the Pacific and somewhat overestimated over the Atlantic and Caribbean basins. Overall, it is assessed that the performance of RegCM4 over Mexico is of sufficient quality to study not only mean precipitation and temperature patterns, but also higher order climate statistics.},

Simulations for the TC seasons of the ten-year period (1989--1998) driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis fields are completed using 50 and 25 km grid spacing, two convection schemes (Emanuel, Em; and Kain--Fritsch, KF) and two ocean surface flux representations, a Monin--Obukhov scheme available in the BATS land surface package (Dickinson et al. 1993), and the scheme of Zeng et al. (J Clim 11(10):2628--2644, 1998). The model performance is assessed against observed TC characteristics for the simulation period. In general, different sensitivities are found over the two basins investigated. The simulations using the KF scheme show higher TC density, longer TC duration (up to 15 days) and stronger peak winds ({\textgreater}50 ms−1) than those using Em ({\textless}40 ms−1). All simulations show a better spatial representation of simulated TC density and interannual variability over the TNA than over the ETP. The 25 km resolution simulations show greater TC density, duration and intensity compared to the 50 km resolution ones, especially over the ETP basin, and generally more in line with observations. Simulated TCs show a strong sensitivity to ocean fluxes, especially over the TNA basin, with the Monin--Obukhov scheme leading to an overestimate of the TC number, and the Zeng scheme being closer to observations. All simulations capture the density of cyclones during active TC seasons over the TNA, however, without data assimilation, the tracks of individual events do not match closely the corresponding observed ones. Overall, the best model performance is obtained when using the KF and Zeng schemes at 25 km grid spacing.},

abstract = {An ensemble of future climate projections performed with the regional climate model RegCM4 is used to assess changes in inter-annual variability of precipitation over Southern Mexico and Central America (SMECAM). Two different Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 are used to provide boundary conditions for two different RegCM4 configurations. This results in four regional climate projections extending from 1970 to 2100 for the greenhouse gas representative concentration pathway RCP8.5. The precipitation variability over the SMECAM region and its dependence on the gradient between Atlantic and Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are verified by reproducing SST anomaly patterns during wettest and driest years similar to those seen in observational datasets. RegCM4 does a comparably better job than the driving GCMs. This strong relationship between precipitation and SST anomalies does not appear to change substantially under future climate conditions. For the rainy season, June to September, we find a future change in inter-annual variability of precipitation towards a much greater occurrence of very dry seasons over the SMECAM region, with this change being more pronounced in the regional than in the global model projections. A greater warming of the Tropical Northeastern Pacific (TNP) compared to the Tropical North Atlantic (TNA), which causes stronger wind fluxes from the TNA to the TNP through the Caribbean Low Level Jet, is identified as the main process responsible for these drier conditions.},

abstract = {South-East France is a region often affected by heavy precipitating events the characteristics of which are likely to be significantly impacted in the future climate. In this study, cnrm-arome, a Convection-Permitting Regional Climate Model with a 2.5 km horizontal resolution is compared to its forcing model, the Regional Climate Model aladin-climate at a horizontal resolution of 12.5 km, self-driven by the era-interim reanalysis. An hourly observation dataset with a resolution of 1 km, comephore, is used in order to assess simulated surface precipitation from a seasonal to hourly scale. The representation of the spatial pattern of fall precipitation climatology is improved by cnrm-arome. It also shows a clear added value with respect to aladin-climate through the improvement of the localization and intensity of extreme rainfall on a daily and hourly time scale on both fine and coarse spatial scales (2.5, 12.5 and 50 km). cnrm-arome in particular is able to simulate intense rainfall on lowlands and makes sub-daily rainfall events more intense than aladin-climate. cnrm-arome still underestimates very extreme precipitation from above 30 mm/h or 230 mm/day.},

abstract = {Peak runoff in streams and rivers of the western United States is strongly influenced by melting of accumulated mountain snowpack. A significant decline in this resource has a direct connection to streamflow, with substantial economic and societal impacts. Observations and reanalyses indicate that between the 1980s and 2000s, there was a 10–20{\%} loss in the annual maximum amount of water contained in the region's snowpack. Here we show that this loss is consistent with results from a large ensemble of climate simulations forced with natural and anthropogenic changes, but is inconsistent with simulations forced by natural changes alone. A further loss of up to 60{\%} is projected within the next 30 years. Uncertainties in loss estimates depend on the size and the rate of response to continued anthropogenic forcing and the magnitude and phasing of internal decadal variability. The projected losses have serious implications for the hydropower, municipal and agricultural sectors in the region.},

Simulations with individual anthropogenic and natural forcings suggest that the observed pattern of precipitation change is substantially forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas and ozone changes, with an opposing influence from aerosols.

abstract = {Climate variability associated with the West African monsoon (WAM) has important environmental and socio-economic impacts in the region. However, state-of-the-art climate models still struggle in producing reliable climate predictions. An important cause of this low predictive skill is the sensitivity of climate models to different forcings. In this study, the mechanisms linking the WAM dynamics to the CO2 forcing are investigated, by comparing the effect of the CO2 direct radiative effect with its indirect effect mediated by the global sea surface warming. The July-to-September WAM variability is studied in climate simulations extracted from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive, driven by prescribed sea surface temperature (SST). The individual roles of global SST warming and CO2 atmospheric concentration increase are investigated through idealized experiments simulating a 4 K warmer SST and a quadrupled CO2 concentration, respectively. Results show opposite and competing responses in the WAM dynamics and precipitation. A dry response (−0.6 mm/day) to the SST warming is simulated in the Sahel, with dryer conditions over western Sahel (−0.8 mm/day). Conversely, the CO2 increase produces wet conditions (+0.5 mm/day) in the Sahel, with the strongest response over central-eastern Sahel (+0.7 mm/day). The associated responses in the atmospheric dynamics are also analysed, showing that the SST warming affects the Sahelian precipitation through modifications in the global tropical atmospheric dynamics, reducing the importance of the regional drivers, while the CO2 increase reinforces the coupling between precipitation and regional dynamics. A general agreement in model responses demonstrates the robustness of the identified mechanisms linking the WAM dynamics to the CO2 direct and indirect forcing, and indicates that these primary mechanisms are captured by climate models. Results also suggest that the spread in future projections may be caused by unbalanced model responses to the CO2 direct and indirect forcing.},

Therefore, in this study a temporal trend of annual temperatures was built with a time series from 1950 to 2010 for Mexicali, Mexico, and estimates of 5- to 100-year return periods are provided by modeling of summer maximum and winter minimum temperatures. A non-parametric Kendall's tau test and the Sen's slope estimator were used to compute trends. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution was applied to the approximation of block maxima and the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) to values over a predetermined threshold. Due to the non-stationary characteristic of the series of temperature values, the temporal trend was included as a covariable in the location parameter and substantial improvements were observed, particularly with the extreme minimum temperature, compared to that obtained with the GEV with no covariable and with the GPD. A positive and significant statistically trend in both summer maximum temperature and winter minimum temperature was found. By the end of 21st century the extreme maximum temperature could be 2 to 3 °C higher than current, and the winter could be less severe, as the probabilistic model suggests increases of 7 to 9 °C in the extreme minimum temperature with respect to the base period. The foreseeable consequences on Mexicali city are discussed.},

abstract = {We examine the ability of an ensemble of 10 Regional Climate Models (RCMs), driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis, in skillfully reproducing key features of present-day precipitation and temperature (1990-2008) over West Africa. We explore a wide range of time scales spanning seasonal climatologies, annual cycles and interannual variability, and a number of spatial scales covering the Sahel, the Gulf of Guinea and the entire West Africa. We find that the RCMs show acceptable performance in simulating the spatial distribution of the main precipitation and temperature features. The occurrence of the West African Monsoon jump, the intensification and northward shift of the Saharan Heat Low (SHL), during the course of the year, are shown to be realistic in most RCMs. They also capture the mean annual cycle of precipitation and temperature, including, single and double-peaked rainy seasons, in terms of timing and amplitude over the homogeneous sub-regions. However, we should emphasize that the RCMs exhibit some biases, which vary considerably in both magnitude and spatial extent from model to model. The interannual variability of seasonal anomalies is best reproduced in temperature rather than precipitation. The ensemble mean considerably improves the skill of most of the individual RCMs. This highlights the importance of performing multi-model assessment in properly estimating the response of the West African climate to global warming at seasonal, annual and interannual time scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The interdecadal change of the leading mode of the mean winter precipitation over China has been investigated using observational data for the period from 1960 to 2012. The leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode (EOF1) of the winter precipitation over China displays a mono-sign pattern over southeastern China, accounting for 49.7 {\%} of the total variance in the precipitation. Both the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) can impact EOF1. A positive (negative) EOF1 is accompanied by warm (cold) ENSO events and weak (strong) EAWM, and the latters can cause anomalous southerlies (northerlies) along the coast of southeastern China, accompanied by the transportation of water vapor from the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea favoring a wet (dry) winter over southeastern China. An abrupt transition of the EOF1 is observed around the mid-1980s. Therefore, the data are divided into two subperiods, i.e., 1960–1987 (P1) and 1988–2009 (P2). Significant differences in the large scale atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature anomalies associated with EOF1 during these two subperiods are observed. EOF1 is closely related to the mid- to high-latitude atmospheric circulation in P1, while its relationship to the tropics obviously increases during P2. The partial regression analysis results show that the interdecadal change of EOF1 is caused by both the interdecadal changes of the EAWM and ENSO around the mid-1980s. In P1, the lower-level anomalous southerlies along the coastal southeastern China accompanied by water vapor transportation that causes above-average precipitation are related to an anti-cyclonic system centered over the mid-latitude western North Pacific associated with EAWM. In P2, the influence of the EAWM is weaker, and the southerly anomaly over the coastal southeastern China is mainly caused by the anticyclone over Philippines, which is related to the ENSO.},

Moreover, the greatest warming is expected in the summertime and can reach 4–6 °C under representative concentration pathways (RCP)8.5 for the middle and end of the century. However, observations show significant variability and seasonal amplitude in temperature regime which is peculiar to mountain regions located in mid-latitudes. It was shown that strong cold wave events can be directly followed by prolonged hot days within one year in Armenia. The CCSM4 model has substantial deficiencies in simulating the regional climate over Armenia. Validation results indicate the largest errors (root-mean-square error (RMSE)) in the representation of winter temperatures. There is also significant uncertainty in projected temperature change patterns in Armenia over the twenty-first century. However, the CCSM4 model becomes more confident in the prediction of temperature increase over Armenia toward the end of the century.},

In this study, precipitation and temperature variables are taken as a proxy to assess and quantify the long-term climate change and drought in the Horn of Africa (HOA) (1930–2014). We adapted a simple linear regression and interpolation to analyze, respectively, the trend and spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation and temperature. In addition, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was applied to evaluate the drought condition of the HOA. The results revealed that statistically the trend of precipitation decreased insignificantly; the trend of temperature was observed to drop very significantly between 1930 and 1969, but it was dramatically elevated very significantly from 1970 to 2014. The SPEI showed that the HOA experienced from mild to moderate drought throughout the study period with severe to extreme drought in some regions, particularly in 1943, 1984, 1991, and 2009. The drought was a very serious environmental problem in the HOA in the last 85 years. Thus, an immediate action is required to tackle drought and hence poverty and famine in the HOA.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Small island developing states (SIDS) are typically characterized by being environmentally and socio-economically vulnerable to disasters and climate change. Additionally, they often have limited resources for freshwater provisioning services. This article presents an assessment of disaster risk and water security-related challenges in SIDS focusing on three major dimensions: (a) how disaster risks are perceived and addressed in the SIDS context using a case study method, (b) analyzing the current status of water security in these regions using an indicator-based approach and (c) assessing gaps and needs in institutions and policies that can facilitate sustainable development goals (SDGs) and targets, adaptation and resilience building in SIDS. In this regard, information on all SIDS is collected to be able to distinguish trends in and between SIDS based on amongst others geographical location and characteristics. This synthesis noted two key observations: first, that in SIDS, the number of disasters is increasing at a higher rate than the global average, and that the frequency and intensity of the disasters will likely increase because of climate change. These combined factors will impact SIDS on the societal level and on environmental levels, reducing their adaptive capacity, resources, and resilience. Second, most SIDS are already water-scarce with low groundwater volumes. Because of increasing demand (e.g., population growth and tourism) and decreasing supply (e.g., pollution and changes in precipitation patterns) freshwater resources are becoming increasingly limited, often suffering from the spillover effects of competing and conflicting uses. Threatened ecosystems and limited economic resources further influence the adaptive capacities of communities in SIDS. In this light, key solutions to address disaster-risk and water security-related challenges can be found by sharing best practices and lessons learned—from examples of good governance, integrated policies, improved community-resilience, and capacity-building. Added to their fragile situation, SIDS struggle to find enough funding to put their development plans, programs, and policies into action.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The large-scale ocean–atmosphere patterns that influence the interannual variability of Caribbean–Central American rainfall are examined. The atmospheric circulation over this region is shaped by the competition between the North Atlantic subtropical high sea level pressure system and the eastern Pacific ITCZ, which influence the convergence patterns on seasonal and interannual timescales. The authors find the leading modes of interannual sea level pressure (SLP) and SST variability associated with Caribbean rainfall, as selected by canonical correlation analysis, to be an interbasin mode, linking the eastern Pacific with the tropical Atlantic, and an Atlantic mode. North Atlantic SLP affects Caribbean rainfall directly, by changing the patterns of surface flow over the region, and indirectly, through SST anomalies. Anomalously high SLP in the region of the North Atlantic high translates into stronger trade winds, hence cooler SSTs, and less Caribbean rainfall. The interbasin mode, which manifests itself as a zonal seesaw in SLP between the tropical Atlantic and the eastern equatorial Pacific, is correlated with ENSO. When SLP is low in the eastern equatorial Pacific, it is high in the tropical Atlantic: the surface atmospheric flow over the basin is divergent, to the west, toward the eastern Pacific ITCZ, and to the east, toward the tropical North Atlantic. A weakened meridional SLP gradient in the tropical North Atlantic signifies weaker trade winds and the opportunity for SSTs to warm up, reaching peak intensity 2–4 months after the mature phase of an ENSO event. This SST anomaly is particularly evident in the Caribbean–western Atlantic basin. The tendency is for drier-than-average conditions when the divergent atmospheric flow dominates, during the rainy season preceding the mature phase of a warm ENSO event. The dry season that coincides with the mature phase of ENSO is wetter than average over the northwestern section of the basin, that is, Yucatan, the Caribbean coast of Honduras, and Cuba, and drier than average over the rest of the basin, that is, Costa Rica and northern South America. The following spring, as the atmospheric circulation transitions to normal conditions, the positive SST anomaly that has built up in the basin takes over, favoring convection. The positive precipitation anomaly spreads southeastward, from the northwest to the entire basin. At the start of a new rainy season, it is especially strong over the Greater Antilles.},

In particular, the extent to which CORDEX (COordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment) adds useful details on the performance of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) multimodel ensemble is investigated. Comparison of the present day simulation was performed with two precipitation observation datasets, the high-resolution TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and coarse resolution GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project), to evaluate models strengths and weaknesses. Eight indices generated from absolute (1 mm) and percentile (95th) based thresholds as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) are computed for seventeen CMIP5 GCMs and six CORDEX RCMs (for twelve downscaling experiments) for each year during the historical period (1975–2004). Our results suggest a good consistency between GPCP and TRMM in producing annual mean and frequency of extreme precipitation events over Africa despite few inconsistencies. However, their associated intensities largely differed from one another with GPCP data displaying drier bias. Overall, multimodel ensembles simulations overestimate the frequency of extreme precipitation events and underestimate their intensities. The results further show that CMIP5 exhibits wet bias of precipitation events and drier bias of precipitation intensity than CORDEX, and that CORDEX produces precipitation magnitude within the range of the observations and more in line with the higher-resolution TRMM data. This illustrates the added value achieved with the higher-resolution CORDEX multimodel ensemble for the simulation of such events, and points toward the use of these RCMs to study extreme precipitation for a better assessment of climate change over Africa.},

abstract = { AbstractClimate model evaluation is complicated by the presence of observational uncertainty. In this study we analyze daily precipitation indices and compare multiple gridded observational and reanalysis products with regional climate models (RCMs) from the North American component of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) multimodel ensemble. In the context of model evaluation, observational product differences across the contiguous United States (CONUS) are also deemed nontrivial for some indices, especially for annual counts of consecutive wet days and for heavy precipitation indices. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is used to directly include this observational spread into the model evaluation procedure, enabling visualization and interpretation of model differences relative to a “cloud” of observational uncertainty. Applying MDS to the evaluation of NA-CORDEX RCMs reveals situations of added value from dynamical downscaling, situations of degraded performance from dynamical downscaling, and the sensitivity of model performance to model resolution. On precipitation days, higher-resolution RCMs typically simulate higher mean and extreme precipitation rates than their lower-resolution pairs, sometimes improving model fidelity with observations. These results document the model spread and biases in daily precipitation extremes across the full NA-CORDEX model ensemble. The often-large divergence between in situ observations, satellite data, and reanalysis, shown here for CONUS, is especially relevant for data-sparse regions of the globe where satellite and reanalysis products are extensively relied upon. This highlights the need to carefully consider multiple observational products when evaluating climate models. },

abstract = {We revisit the issue of the response of precipitation characteristics to global warming based on analyses of global and regional climate model projections for the 21st century. The prevailing response we identify can be summarized as follows: increase in the intensity of precipitation events and extremes, with the occurrence of events of “unprecedented” magnitude, i.e., a magnitude not found in the present-day climate; decrease in the number of light precipitation events and in wet spell lengths; and increase in the number of dry days and dry spell lengths. This response, which is mostly consistent across the models we analyzed, is tied to the difference between precipitation intensity responding to increases in local humidity conditions and circulations, especially for heavy and extreme events, and mean precipitation responding to slower increases in global evaporation. These changes in hydroclimatic characteristics have multiple and important impacts on the Earth's hydrologic cycle and on a variety of sectors. As examples we investigate effects on potential stress due to increases in dry and wet extremes, changes in precipitation interannual variability, and changes in the potential predictability of precipitation events. We also stress how the understanding of the hydroclimatic response to global warming can provide important insights into the fundamental behavior of precipitation processes, most noticeably tropical convection.},

abstract = {Daily temperature measurements from six meteorological stations along the coast and fjords of western Spitsbergen have been digitized and quality controlled in a Norwegian, Russian and Polish collaboration. Complete daily data series have been reconstructed back to 1948 for all of the stations. One of the station's monthly temperature series has previously been extended back to 1898 and is included in this study. The long-term series show large temperature variability on western Spitsbergen with colder periods in the 1910s and 1960s and warmer periods in the 1930s, 1950s and in the 21st century. The most recent years are the warmest ones in the instrumental records. There is a positive and statistically significant trend in the annual times series for all of the stations; however, the strongest warming is seen in winter and spring. For the period 1979–2015, the linear trends range from 1.0 to 1.3°C/decade for the annual series and from 2.0 to 2.3°C/decade in winter. Threshold statistics demonstrate a decrease in the number of cold days per year and an increase in the number of warm days. A decreasing inter-annual variability is observed. In winter, spring and autumn, the stations in the northernmost areas of west Spitsbergen and in the innermost parts of Isfjorden are the coldest ones. In summer, however, the southernmost station is the coldest one.Keywords: Svalbard; Arctic; trends; development; warming; temperature changes.(Published: 29 July 2016)To access the supplementary material for this article, please see the supplementary files in the column to the right (under Article Tools).Citation: Polar Research 2016, 35, 29878, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/polar.v35.29878},

abstract = {This study revisits the northern mode of East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) variation and investigates its response to global warming based on the ERA dataset and outputs from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models. Results show that the observed variation in East Asian surface air temperature (EAT) is tightly coupled with sea level pressure variation in the expanded Siberian high (SH) region during boreal winter. The first singular value decomposition (SVD) mode of the EAT and SH explains 95{\%} of the squared covariance in observations from 1961 to 2005, which actually represents the northern mode of EAWM variation. Meanwhile, the first SVD mode of the EAT and SH is verified to be equivalent to the first empirical orthogonal function mode (EOF1) of the EAT and SH, respectively. Since the leading mode of the temperature variation is significantly influenced by radiative forcing in a rapidly warming climate, for reliable projection of long-term changes in the northern mode of the EAWM, we further employ the EOF1 mode of the SH to represent the northern mode of EAWM variation. The models can well reproduce this coupling between the EAT and SH in historical simulations. Meanwhile, a robust weakening of the northern mode of the EAWM is found in the RCP4.5 scenario, and with stronger warming in the RCP8.5 scenario, the weakening of the EAWM is more pronounced. It is found that the weakening of the northern mode of the EAWM can contribute 6.7{\%} and 9.4{\%} of the warming trend in northern East Asian temperature under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively.},

abstract = {The upward evolution of temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula has weakened and even reversed in the last two decades. Due to the long-term variability in the region it is not easy to assess whether recent cooling trends are consistent with the internal variability or not. For this reason, this paper assesses the robustness of the trends by analysing their sensitivity with respect to the period selected. Every possible temperature trend in the interval 1958-2016 has been calculated and displayed in a two-dimensional parameter diagram. The results suggest that the warming observed in the Antarctic Peninsula since 1958 is quite robust, as all periods longer than 30 years exhibit statistically significant changes, especially in summer (with lower magnitude and higher significance) and autumn and winter (with larger magnitude and lower significance). Periods shorter than 30 years exhibit alternations of warming and cooling periods, and therefore do not represent robust trends even if they are statistically significant. Consequently, the recent 20-year cooling trend cannot be considered at the moment as evidence of a shift in the overall sign of the trend.},

abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are an important component of the hydrological cycle linking moisture sources in lower latitudes to the Antarctic surface mass balance. We investigate AR signatures in the atmospheric vertical profiles at the Dronning Maud Land coast, East Antarctica, using regular and extra radiosonde measurements conducted during the Year of Polar Prediction Special Observing Period November 2018 to February 2019. Prominent AR events affecting the locations of Neumayer and Syowa cause a strong increase in specific humidity extending through the mid-troposphere and a strong low-level jet (LLJ). At Neumayer, the peak in the moisture inversion (up to 4 g kg−1) is observed between 800 and 900 hPa, while the LLJ (up to 32 m s−1) is concentrated below 900 hPa. At Syowa the increase in humidity is less pronounced and peaks near the surface, while there is a substantial increase in wind speed (up to 40 m s−1) between 825 and 925 hPa. Moisture transport (MT) within the vertical profile during the ARs attains a maximum of 100 g kg−1 m s−1 at both locations, and is captured by both ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalysis data at Neumayer, but is strongly underestimated at Syowa. Composites of the enhanced MT events during 2009-19 show that these events represent an extreme state of the lower-tropospheric profile compared to its median values with respect to temperature, humidity, wind speed and, consequently, MT. High temporal- and vertical-resolution radiosonde observations are important for understanding the contribution of these rare events to the total MT towards Antarctica and improving their representation in models.},

abstract = {Abstract. A new comprehensive cloud–precipitation–meteorological observatory has been established at Princess Elisabeth base, located in the escarpment zone of Dronning Maud Land (DML), East Antarctica. The observatory consists of a set of ground-based remote-sensing instruments (ceilometer, infrared pyrometer and vertically profiling precipitation radar) combined with automatic weather station measurements of near-surface meteorology, radiative fluxes, and snow height. In this paper, the observatory is presented and the potential for studying the evolution of clouds and precipitating systems is illustrated by case studies. It is shown that the synergetic use of the set of instruments allows for distinguishing ice, liquid-containing clouds and precipitating clouds, including some information on their vertical extent. In addition, wind-driven blowing snow events can be distinguished from deeper precipitating systems. Cloud properties largely affect the surface radiative fluxes, with liquid-containing clouds dominating the radiative impact. A statistical analysis of all measurements (in total 14 months mainly during summer–beginning of winter) indicates that these liquid-containing clouds occur during as much as 20{\%} of the cloudy periods. The cloud occurrence shows a strong bimodal distribution with clear-sky conditions 51{\%} of the time and complete overcast conditions 35{\%} of the time. Snowfall occurred during 17{\%} of the cloudy periods with a predominance of light precipitation and only rare events with snowfall {\textgreater}1 mm h−1 water equivalent (w.e.). Three of such intense snowfall events occurred during 2011 contributing to anomalously large annual surface mass balance (SMB). Large accumulation events ({\textgreater}10 mm w.e. day−1) during the radar-measurement period of 26 months were always associated with snowfall, but at the same time other snowfall events did not always lead to accumulation. The multiyear deployment of a precipitation radar in Antarctica allows for assessing the contribution of the snowfall to the local SMB and comparing it to the other SMB components. During 2012, snowfall rate was 110 ± 20 mm w.e. yr−1, from which surface and drifting snow sublimation removed together 23{\%}. Given the measured yearly SMB of 52 ± 3 mm w.e., the residual term of 33 ± 21 mm w.e. yr−1 was attributed to the wind-driven snow erosion. In general, this promising set of robust instrumentation allows for improved insight into cloud and precipitation processes in Antarctica and can be easily deployed at other Antarctic stations.},

abstract = {Abstract. An increase in Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) surface mass balance (SMB) has the potential to mitigate future sea level rise that is driven by enhanced solid ice discharge from the ice sheet. For climate models, AIS SMB provides a difficult challenge, as it is highly susceptible to spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability. Here we use a reconstructed data set of AIS snow accumulation as “true” observational data, to evaluate the ability of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 suites of models in capturing the mean, trends, temporal variability, and spatial variability in SMB over the historical period (1850–2000). This gives insight into which models are most reliable for predicting SMB into the future. We found that the best scoring models included the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GISS model and the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Meteorology's model for CMIP5, as well as one of the Community Earth System Model v2 (CESM2) models and one MPI model for CMIP6. Using a scoring system based on SMB mean value, trend, and temporal variability across the AIS, as well as spatial SMB variability, we selected a subset of the top 10th percentile of models to refine 21st century (2000–2100) AIS-integrated SMB projections to 2274 ± 282 Gt yr−1, 2358 ± 286 Gt yr−1, and 2495 ± 291 Gt yr−1 for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, respectively. We also reduced the spread in AIS-integrated mean SMB by 79 {\%}, 79 {\%}, and 74 {\%} in RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, respectively. Notably, we find that there is no improvement from CMIP5 to CMIP6 in overall score. In fact, CMIP6 performed slightly worse on average compared to CMIP5 at capturing the aforementioned SMB criteria. Our results also indicate that model performance scoring is affected by internal climate variability (particularly the spatial variability), which is illustrated by the fact that the range in overall score between ensemble members within the CESM1 Large Ensemble is comparable to the range in overall score between CESM1 model simulations within the CMIP5 model suite. We also find that a higher horizontal resolution does not yield to a conclusive improvement in score.},

The near-surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity are compared with datasets of in situ observations, together with an assessment of the simulated surface mass balance (approximated by precipitation minus evaporation). No reanalysis clearly stands out as the best performing for all areas, seasons, and variables, and each of the reanalyses displays different biases. CFSR strongly overestimates the relative humidity during all seasons whereas ERA-5 and MERRA-2 (and, to a lesser extent, ERA-Interim) strongly underestimate relative humidity during winter. ERA-5 captures the seasonal cycle of near-surface temperature best and shows the smallest bias relative to the observations. The other reanalyses show a general temperature underestimation during the winter months in the Antarctic interior and overestimation in the coastal areas. All reanalyses underestimate the mean near-surface winds in the interior (except MERRA-2) and along the coast during the entire year. The winds at the Antarctic Peninsula are overestimated by all reanalyses except MERRA-2. All models are able to capture snowfall patterns related to atmospheric rivers, with varying accuracy. Accumulation is best represented by ERA-5, although it underestimates observed surface mass balance and there is some variability in the accumulation over the different elevation classes, for all reanalyses.},

abstract = {The dates of the transition between winter and summer (W2S) and between summer and winter (S2W) regional-scale atmospheric regimes have been defined using daily weather types above and around the Caribbean basin from 1979 to 2017. The uncertainties due to either the use of two different reanalyses (i.e., NCEP-DOE and ERA-Interim) or the parametrization used for the definition of the transition dates have typically a small impact on the interannual variability of the seasonal transitions. When both reanalyses are considered together, the average W2S transition date occurs, on average, on May 13 (with a standard deviation of 9 days) while the S2W transition date occurs, on average, on October 26 (with a standard deviation of 12 days). The atmospheric characteristics associated with both transitions reveal asymmetries in the annual cycle. The W2S transition is rather abrupt and near-synchronous to a rather sharp increase of rainfall, propagating from Central America to the NE of the Caribbean basin, and a weakening of the Caribbean Low Level Jet. The W2S transition is also not preceded by any significant sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies either in the tropical North Atlantic or the Eastern Pacific. On the other hand, the S2W transition is overall smoother, and anomalously warm (cold) SST over the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico (Eastern Pacific) during the boreal summer are usually related to a delayed transition (and vice versa). The interannual variations of S2W and W2S transitions are mostly independent to each other. The potential and real-time predictability of the W2S transition is explored using a subseasonal-to-seasonal prediction ensemble (11 runs from 1998 to 2017) from the ECMWF model. Its skill is close to zero with a lead time longer than 15–20 days, confirming the weak impact of the antecedent SST upon the W2S transition. The skill suddenly increases from late April, 2–3 weeks only before the mean W2S transition date. It suggests that some atmospheric forcing, operating from synoptic to intra-seasonal time scale, plays a role, but it seems barely related to any occurrence, or sequence, of specific weather types.},

In the interactively coupled run, the ocean and the atmosphere components were allowed to exchange mass, momentum and heat every 3 h. Our results show that interactive coupling significantly improves simulated winter sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Baltic Sea. The ocean and atmosphere stand-alone runs, respectively, resulted in too low sea surface and air temperatures over the Baltic Sea. These two runs suffer from too cold prescribed ERA40 SSTs, which lower air temperatures and weaken winds in the atmosphere only run. In the ocean-only run, the weaker winds additionally lower the vertical mixing thereby lowering the upward transport of warmer subpycnocline waters. By contrast, in the interactively coupled run, the ocean–atmosphere heat exchange evolved fre...},

abstract = {The atmospheric northward energy transport plays a crucial role for the Arctic climate; this transport brings to the Arctic an amount of energy comparable to that provided directly by the sun. The transport is accomplished by atmospheric waves–for instance large-scale planetary waves and meso-scale cyclones–and the zonal-mean circulation. These different components of the energy transport impact the Arctic climate differently. A split of the transport into stationary and transient waves constitutes a traditional way of decomposing the transport. However this procedure does not take into account the transport accomplished separately by the planetary and synoptic-scale waves. Here a Fourier decomposition is applied, which decomposes the transport with respect to zonal wave numbers. Reanalysis and model data reveal that the planetary waves impact Arctic temperatures much more than do synoptic-scale waves. In addition the latent transport by these waves affects the Arctic climate more than does the dry-static part. Finally, the EC-Earth model suggests that changes of the energy transport over the twentyfirst century will contribute to Arctic warming, despite the fact that in this model the total energy transport to the Arctic will decrease. This apparent contradictory result is due to the cooling induced by a decrease of the dry-static transport by planetary waves being more than compensated for by a warming caused by the latent counterpart.},

abstract = {The first results of a campaign of intensive observation of precipitation in Dumont d'Urville, Antarctica, are presented. Several instruments collected data from November 2015 to February 2016 or longer, including a polarimetric radar (MXPol), a Micro Rain Radar (MRR), a weighing gauge (Pluvio2), and a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). These instruments collected the first ground-based measurements of precipitation in the region of Ad{\'{e}}lie Land (Terre Ad{\'{e}}lie), including precipitation microphysics. Microphysical observations during the austral summer 2015/2016 showed that, close to the ground level, aggregates are the dominant hydrometeor type, together with small ice particles (mostly originating from blowing snow), and that riming is a recurring process. Eleven percent of the measured particles were fully developed graupel, and aggregates had a mean riming degree of about 30 {\%}. Spurious precipitation in the Pluvio2 measurements in windy conditions, leading to phantom accumulations, is observed and partly removed through synergistic use of MRR data. The yearly accumulated precipitation of snow (300 m above ground), obtained by means of a local conversion relation of MRR data, trained on the Pluvio2 measurement of the summer period, is estimated to be 815 mm of water equivalent, with a confidence interval ranging between 739.5 and 989 mm. Data obtained in previous research from satellite-borne radars, and the ERA-Interim reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provide lower yearly totals: 655 mm for ERA-Interim and 679 mm for the climatological data over DDU. ERA-Interim overestimates the occurrence of low-intensity precipitation events especially in summer, but it compensates for them by underestimating the snowfall amounts carried by the most intense events. Overall, this paper provides insightful examples of the added values of precipitation monitoring in Antarctica with a synergistic use of in situ and remote sensing measurements.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, advanced statistical inference and machine learning have been used to fill the gaps in sparse surface ocean CO2 measurements (R{\"{o}}denbeck et al., 2015). The estimates from these methods have been used to constrain seasonal, interannual and decadal variability in sea-air CO2 fluxes and the drivers of these changes (Landsch{\"{u}}tzer et al., 2015, 2016; Gregor et al., 2018). However, it is also becoming clear that these methods are converging towards a common bias and root mean square error (RMSE) boundary: "the wall", which suggests that pCO2 estimates are now limited by both data gaps and scale-sensitive observations. Here, we analyse this problem by introducing a new gapfilling method, an ensemble average of six machine-learning models (CSIR-ML6 version 2019a, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research - Machine Learning ensemble with Six members), where each model is constructed with a twostep clustering-regression approach. The ensemble average is then statistically compared to well-established methods. The ensemble average, CSIR-ML6, has an RMSE of 17.16 $\mu$atm and bias of 0.89 $\mu$atm when compared to a test dataset kept separate from training procedures. However, when validating our estimates with independent datasets, we find that our method improves only incrementally on other gap-filling methods.We investigate the differences between the methods to understand the extent of the limitations of gap-filling estimates of pCO2. We show that disagreement between methods in the South Atlantic, southeastern Pacific and parts of the Southern Ocean is too large to interpret the interannual variability with confidence. We conclude that improvements in surface ocean pCO2 estimates will likely be incremental with the optimisation of gap-filling methods by (1) the inclusion of additional clustering and regression variables (e.g. eddy kinetic energy), (2) increasing the sampling resolution and (3) successfully incorporating pCO2 estimates from alternate platforms (e.g. floats, gliders) into existing machinelearning approaches.},

abstract = {Extratropical cyclones play a principal role in wintertime precipitation and severe weather over North America. On average, the greatest number of cyclones track 1) from the lee of the Rocky Mountains eastward across the Great Lakes and 2) over the Gulf Stream along the eastern coastline of North America. However, the cyclone tracks are highly variable within individual winters and between winter seasons. In this study, the authors apply a Lagrangian tracking algorithm to examine variability in extratropical cyclone tracks over North America during winter. A series of methodological criteria is used to isolate cyclone development and decay regions and to account for the elevated topography over western North America. The results confirm the signatures of four climate phenomena in the intraseasonal and interannual variability in North American cyclone tracks: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific – North America pattern (PNA), and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). Similar signatures are found using Eulerian band-pass filtered eddy variances. Variability in the number of extratropical cyclones at most locations in North America is linked to fluctuations in Rossby wave trains extending from the central tropical Pacific Ocean. Only over the far northeastern United States and northeastern Canada is cyclone variability strongly linked to the NAO. The results suggest that Pacific sector variability (ENSO, PNA, MJO) is a key contributor to intraseasonal and interannual variability in the frequency of extratropical cyclones at most locations across North America.},

abstract = {Freezing rain and freezing drizzle events represent a critical feature of many regions of the world. Even at low intensities, these events often result in natural hazards that cause damage to housing, communication lines, and other man-made infrastructure. These events usually occur near the 0 °C isotherm. In a changing climate, this isotherm will not disappear, but its position in space and time will likely change as will the geography of freezing precipitation. A larger influx of water vapor into the continents from the oceans may also increase the amount and frequency of freezing precipitation events. This paper assesses our current understanding of recent changes in freezing precipitation for the United States, Canada, Norway, and Russia. The research is part of a larger GEWEX Cross-Cut Project addressing 'cold/shoulder season precipitation near 0 °C'. Using an archive of 874 long-term time series (40 years of data) of synoptic observations for these four countries, we document the climatology of daily freezing rain and freezing drizzle occurrences as well as trends therein. The regions with the highest frequency of freezing rains (from 3 to 8 days per year) reside in the northeastern quadrant of the conterminous United States and adjacent areas of southeastern Canada south of 50 °N and over the south and southwest parts of the Great East European Plain. The frequency of freezing drizzle exceeds the frequency of freezing rain occurrence in all areas. During the past decade, the frequency of freezing rain events somewhat decreased over the southeastern US. In North America north of the Arctic Circle, it increased by about 1 day yr-1. Over Norway, freezing rain occurrences increased substantially, especially in the Norwegian Arctic. In European Russia and western Siberia, the frequency of freezing rain somewhat increased (except the southernmost steppe regions and the Arctic regions) while freezing drizzle frequency decreased over entire Russia.},

abstract = {Change to precipitation in a warming climate holds many implications for water management into the future, and an enhancement of a precipitation decrease or increase on or around mountains would have numerous impacts. Here, an intermediate resolution regional climate model (RCM) ensemble projects enhanced precipitation decrease on the windward slopes of over many mid-latitude mountains in winter, consistent with theory and model studies of idealised mountain ranges. This ensemble projects that an increase in convective rainfall determines the sign of total rainfall change in many regions in summer, only some of which are on or near mountains such as the European Alps. These same projected changes are present in inland slopes of the Australian Alps compared to surrounding regions as simulated by three RCM ensembles (the intermediate resolution and two high resolution ensembles), which agree on an enhanced precipitation decrease on the windward slopes in winter and spring, as well as an enhanced precipitation increase in summer driven by an increase in convective rainfall. The ensembles disagree on an enhanced precipitation decrease in autumn. The results represent regional-scale added value in the climate change signal of projections from high resolution models in cooler seasons, but suggest that the specific model components such as convection schemes strongly influence projections of summer rainfall change. Confidence in the simulation of change in convective rainfall, or convection-permitting modelling may be needed to raise confidence in summer rainfall projections over mountains.},

This study examines circulation features relevant to southern Australian rainfall in January and July and explores emergent constraints suggested by the intermodel spread and their impact on the resulting rainfall projection in the CMIP5 ensemble. The authors find relationships between models' bias and projected change for four features in July, each with suggestions for constraining forced change. The features are the strength of the subtropical jet over Australia, the frequency of blocked days in eastern Australia, the longitude of the peak blocking frequency east of Australia, and the latitude of the storm track within the polar front branch of the split jet. Rejecting models where the bias suggests either the direction or magnitude of change in the features is implausible produces a constraint on the projected rainfall reduction for southern Australia. For RCP8.5 by the end of the century the constrained projections are for a reduction of at least 5{\%} in July (with models showing increase or little change being rejected). Rejecting these models in the January projections, with the assumption the bias affects the entire simulation, leads to a rejection of wet and dry outliers.},

abstract = {Persistent shifts in mean rainfall have wide-ranging impacts to hydrology and water availability, and a reliable set of climate projections of change to mean rainfall is a useful tool for future planning. Most climate models project a decrease in winter rainfall in southern Australia, however there is a wide model range and there is not yet a robust assessment of underlying physical processes that can inform and constrain projections. Here, a multiple linear regression model between indices of atmospheric circulation and gridded rainfall in observations and in CMIP5 climate models is developed for July, representing the peak of winter. The regression is used as an evaluation tool for models and a basis to select models. Spatial distributions of the coefficients from the regression illustrate the relative important of different circulation features for rainfall across the region, and illustrate where climate models have deficiencies. As an additional check of projections, historical years that are an analogue for the projected future mean state of the atmospheric circulation are identified and the rainfall anomaly during those years is examined. Both approaches broadly agree and support previous work in suggesting a constraint on rainfall change to a decrease only. The regression analysis also suggests that the median projection for southwest Western Australia should be revised lower than the median of all climate models. The results demonstrate value in applying statistical techniques to understand relationships of rainfall to circulation and to refine confidence in regional climate projections.},

abstract = {Abstract Outputs from new state-of-the-art climate models under the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) promise improvement and enhancement of climate change projections information for Australia. Here we focus on three key aspects of CMIP6: what is new in these models, how the available CMIP6 models evaluate compared to CMIP5, and their projections of the future Australian climate compared to CMIP5 focussing on the highest emissions scenario. The CMIP6 ensemble has several new features of relevance to policymakers and others, for example, the integrated matrix of socioeconomic and concentration pathways. The CMIP6 models show incremental improvements in the simulation of the climate in the Australian region, including a reduced equatorial Pacific cold tongue bias, slightly improved rainfall teleconnections with large-scale climate drivers, improved representation of atmosphere and ocean extreme heat events, as well as dynamic sea level. However, important regional biases remain, evident in the excessive rainfall over the Maritime Continent and rainfall pattern biases in the nearby tropical convergence zones. Projections of Australian temperature and rainfall from the available CMIP6 ensemble broadly agree with those from CMIP5, except for a group of CMIP6 models with higher climate sensitivity and greater warming and increase in some extremes after 2050. CMIP6 rainfall projections are similar to CMIP5, but the ensemble examined has a narrower range of rainfall change in austral summer in Northern Australia and austral winter in Southern Australia. Overall, future national projections are likely to be similar to previous versions but perhaps with some areas of improved confidence and clarity.},

abstract = {Mesoscale model simulations are presented of a westerly f{\"{o}}hn event over the Antarctic Peninsula mountain ridge and onto the Larsen C ice shelf, just south of the recently collapsed Larsen B ice shelf. Aircraft observations showed the presence of f{\"{o}}hn jets descending near the ice shelf surface with maximum wind speeds at 250-350 m in height. Surface flux measurements suggested that melting was occurring. Simulated profiles of wind speed, temperature and wind direction were very similar to the observations. However, the good match only occurred at a model time corresponding to ∼9 h before the aircraft observations were made since the model f{\"{o}}hn jets died down after this. This was despite the fact that the model was nudged towards analysis for heights greater than ∼1.15 km above the surface. Timing issues aside, the otherwise good comparison between the model and observations gave confidence that the model flow structure was similar to that in reality. Details of the model jet structure are explored and discussed and are found to have ramifications for the placement of automatic weather station (AWS) stations on the ice shelf in order to detect f{\"{o}}hn flow. Cross sections of the flow are also examined and were found to compare well to the aircraft measurements. Gravity wave breaking above the mountain crest likely created a∼situation similar to hydraulic flow and allowed f{\"{o}}hn flow and ice shelf surface warming to occur despite strong upwind blocking, which in previous studies of this region has generally not been considered. Our results therefore suggest that reduced upwind blocking, due to wind speed increases or stability decreases, might not result in an increased likelihood of f{\"{o}}hn events over the Antarctic Peninsula, as previously suggested. The surface energy budget of the model during the melting periods showed that the net downwelling short-wave surface flux was the largest contributor to the melting energy, indicating that the cloud clearing effect of f{\"{o}}hn events is likely to be the most important factor for increased melting relative to non-f{\"{o}}hn days. The results also indicate that the warmth of the f{\"{o}}hn jets through sensible heat flux ("SH") may not be critical in causing melting beyond boundary layer stabilisation effects (which may help to prevent cloud cover and suppress loss of heat by convection) and are actually cancelled by latent heat flux ("LH") effects (snow ablation). It was found that ground heat flux ("GRD") was likely to be an important factor when considering the changing surface energy budget for the southern regions of the ice shelf as the climate warms.},

However, assessments of possible causes of the reported regional changes have so far been inconclusive. Here we investigate whether anthropogenic emissions have altered past and present meteorological (precipitation) drought risk. For doing so we first estimate the magnitude of 20 year return period drought years that would occur without anthropogenic effects on the climate. Subsequently we quantify to which degree the occurrence probability, i.e. the risk, of these years has changed if anthropogenic climate change is accounted for. Both an observational and a climate model-based assessment suggest that it is {\textgreater}95{\%} likely that human emissions have increased the probability of drought years in the Mediterranean, whereas it is {\textgreater}95{\%} likely that the probability of dry years has decreased in northern Europe. In central Europe the evidence is inconclusive. The results highlight that anthropogenic climate change has already increased drought risk in southern Europe, stressing the need to develop efficient mitigation measures.},

Rainfall during the month of July shows a decreasing trend over most parts of the central India. However, rainfall during June and August shows increasing trend over the central and south-western parts of the country. Significant decreasing trends are observed in the seasonal rainfall over three subdivisions, and significant increasing trends are observed over eight other subdivisions. The analysis of the north-east monsoon (October–December) rainfall over the five met-subdivisions of Peninsular India reveals no significant long-term trend.

In this study, eight SPEs based on four different algorithms, namely, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42, Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Imagery Using Artificial Neural Networks are evaluated by using an improved evaluation system over central Asia with respect to their performance in capturing precipitation occurrence and magnitude. Both satellite-only and gauge-corrected versions are assessed against gauge-gridded reference from June 2001 to May 2006. Main results show that all SPEs have difficulties in accurately estimating mountainous precipitation with great overestimation/underestimation in both winter and summer. In winter, CMORPH products fail to capture events over ice-/snow-covered region. In summer, large overestimations dominated by positive hit bias and missed precipitation are found for all products in northern central Asia. Interestingly, 3B42 and CMORPH products show great false alarm percentages (up to 90{\%}) over lake region, which is more significant in summer than in winter. Significant elevation-dependent errors exist in all products, especially for the high-altitude regions ({\textgreater}3,000 m) with missed error and hit error being the two leading errors. Satellite-only products have large systematic and random errors, while the gauge-corrected products demonstrate significant improvements in reducing random errors. Generally, the gauge-corrected GSMaP performs better than others with good skills in reducing various errors.},

abstract = {AbstractUsing a regional climate model (RCM) is generally regarded as a promising approach in researching the climate of the Tibetan Plateau, due to the advantages provided by the high resolutions of these models. Whilst previous studies have focused mostly on individual RCM simulations, here, multiple RCMs from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment are evaluated in simulating surface air temperature and precipitation changes over the Tibetan Plateau using station and gridded observations. The results show the following: (1) All RCMs consistently show similar spatial patterns, but a mean cold (wet) bias in the temperature (precipitation) climatology compared to station observations. The RCMs fail to reproduce the observed spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation trends, and on average produce greater trends in temperature and smaller trends in precipitation than observed results.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Snowfall in mountainous areas provides indispensable water sources for arid and semi-arid watersheds. Changes in snowfall and snowmelt regimes have significantly impacted the water resources' variations and management. This study addresses the ratio of snowfall to precipitation (S/P) in the Tian Shan Mountains, China. It aims to examine changes in S/P ratio and its synchronization with climate change. The results show that the average S/P ratio experienced a downward trend under the precipitation and snowfall increases as well as temperature increases during the cold seasons in 1961?2010. Spatially, the S/P ratios show an increasing trend in the Boertala Valley and the southern slope of the middle Tian Shan Mountains, but a decreasing trend in Yili Valley, and the western and the northern slope of the middle Tian Shan Mountains. The S/P ratios decreased significantly in middle altitudes with elevation ranging from 1500 to 2500 m, but either decreased or increased at elevations below 1500 m due to a temperature inversion in the elevation belt. In high altitudes with elevation over 3500 m, the magnitudes of the decreased S/P ratios were small because the temperature was always below freezing. The decreases in S/P ratio was mainly attributed to the relative changes in snowfall (dS/S) being less than that in precipitation (dP/P), whereas the increases in S/P ratio resulted from the relative changes in snowfall (dS/S) being more than that in precipitation (dP/P). Temperature increases have also lead to the decreases in S/P ratios to some extent.},

abstract = {In drought-prone regions like Central Asia, drought monitoring studies are paramount to provide valuable information for drought risk mitigation. In this paper, the spatiotemporal drought characteristics in Central Asia are analyzed from 1966 to 2015 using the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) dataset. Drought events, as well as their frequency, duration, severity, intensity and preferred season, are studied by using the Run theory and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month timescales. The Principle Components Analysis (PCA) and the Varimax rotation method, the Sen's slope and the Modified Mann-Kendall method (MMK), as well as the wavelet analysis are adopted to identify the sub-regional drought patterns and to study the drought trend, periodicity and the possible links between drought variation and large-scale climate patterns, respectively. Results show that the drought characteristics in Central Asia vary considerably. The Hexi Corridor region and the southeastern part suffered from more short-term drought occurrences which mostly occurred in summer while the northeastern part experienced fewer droughts with longer duration and higher severity. Central Asia showed an overall wetting trend with a switch to drying trend since 2003. Regionally, the continuous wetting trend is found in north Kazakhstan while a consistent drying in the Aral Sea and Hexi Corridor region is observed in the last half-century. For 2003–2015, a significant drying pattern is detected in most Central Asia, except the northern Kazakhstan. A common significant 16–64-month periodical oscillation can be detected over the six sub-regions. The drought changes in Central Asia are highly associated with ENSO but less related to the Tibetan Plateau pressure. The North Atlantic Oscillation has an influence on drought change in most Central Asia but less for the Hexi Corridor and the drought variation in eastern Central Asia is affected by the strength of the Siberian High.},

An evaluation framework was constructed taking into account metrics of annual precipitation patterns, annual cycle precipitation statistics, categorical validation and long-term precipitation trend. The performance of GCMs vary from region to region. Compared to CRU, the 30 selected GCMs present considerable wet bias in the Southern Xinjiang (SX) and Hexi Corridor (HC) regions which can be larger than 100{\%}. The simulated precipitation from most GCMs shows a consistent annual cycle shape and closer with that of observations in the western ACA, but fails to capture precipitation peak in NK and NX regions. Compared to NK, CD, TM and NX, all models and the full model ensemble have limited ability in reproducing the Probability Density Function (PDF) of observations over SX and HC. Most GCMs show limited competence to reproduce the long-term precipitation trend with high wet bias over the Hexi Corridor. Based on the comprehensive performance ranking, it is discovered that CESM2, CESM2-FV2, CESM2-WACCM and CESM2-WACCM-FV2 from NCAR, ACCESS-CM2 from CSIRO and CanESM5 from Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling demonstrate better performances across ACA. The ensemble of 30 selected GCMs has limited ability to accurately simulate precipitation according to the above four types of metrics. The results of this paper may provide scientific guidance to CMIP6 end-users when selecting the most suitable GCMs for their specific applications over ACA.},

The newly released Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) with a long-term record and high resolution has a great potential for drought monitoring. Based on the assessment of CHIRPS for capturing precipitation and monitoring drought, this study aims to evaluate the drought condition in LMB by using satellite-based CHIRPS from January 1981 to July 2016. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at various time scales (1–12-month) is computed to identify and describe drought events. Results suggest that CHIRPS can properly capture the drought characteristics at various time scales with the best performance at three-month time scale. Based on high-resolution long-term CHIRPS, it is found that LMB experienced four severe droughts during the last three decades with the longest one in 1991–1994 for 38 months and the driest one in 2015–2016 with drought affected area up to 75.6{\%}. Droughts tend to occur over the north and south part of LMB with higher frequency, and Mekong Delta seems to experience more long-term and extreme drought events. Severe droughts have significant impacts on vegetation condition.},

We find a significant improvement in CMIP6 models in capturing the spatiotemporal pattern of monsoon over Indian landmass, especially in the Western Ghats and North-East foothills of Himalayas. We also show that present-day global warming of 0.6 °C over Indian landmass is remarkably consistent with the changes in annual maximum 1-day precipitation in MMA of CMIP6, which are in agreement with the observations. Our results suggest that added value in CMIP6 models precipitation simulations is not consistent within CMs used in present study.

abstract = {The increase in the photovoltaic energy installed capacity over the world leads to the need of a better understanding of solar resource and its variability. The aim of this work is to assess the influence of aerosols on photovoltaic energy production from seasonal to multi-decadal time scales. For this purpose we use various coupled aerosol-climate simulations that take into account the complex spatial and temporal patterns of natural and anthropogenic aerosols over the Euro-Mediterranean domain. The results show that aerosols strongly influence the spatial pattern, seasonal cycle and long-term trend of PV production. The most affected area is Central Europe where sensitivity of PV production to aerosols is higher. The annual production loss due to aerosols ranges from no impact to -16{\%} in The Netherlands, with variation depending on the area and on the typology of the tracking system. The summer production loss can even reach -20{\%} over regions of Africa and Syria-Iraq. We conclude that aerosols cannot be neglected in the assessment of PV production at large time scales over the Euro-Mediterranean area. Besides, the potential increase in energy due to reduction in the anthropogenic aerosols is shown in the simulation of the brightening period over Europe, with an increase of 2000 kWhkWp in a PV lifetime for the most affected areas. It illustrates the evolution that PV potential could follow in highly polluted areas through the effective implementation of pollution control measures.},

abstract = {In recent decades, trends in photovoltaic (PV) technology deployment have shown an overall increase across the world. Comprehensive knowledge of the solar resource and its future evolution is demanded by the energy sector. Solar resource and PV potential have been estimated in several studies using both the global climate model (GCM) and regional climate model (RCM), revealing a GCM-RCM discrepancy in the projected change over Europe. An increase in surface solar radiation (SSR) (and therefore in PV potential production) is projected by GCMs, whereas most RCM simulations project a decrease in SSR over Europe. In this work, we investigate the role of aerosol forcing in RCMs as a key explaining factor of this inconsistency. The results show that RCM simulations including evolving aerosols agree with GCMs in the sign and amplitude of the SSR change over Europe for mid-21st century projections (2021-2050 compared to 1971-2000 for representative concentration pathway climate change scenario RCP8.5). The opposite signal is projected by the rest of the RCMs. The amplitude of the changes likely depends on the RCM and on its aerosol forcing choice. In terms of PV potential, RCMs including evolving aerosols simulate an increase, especially in summer for Central and Eastern Europe, with maximum values reaching +10{\%} in some cases. This study illustrates the key role of the often-neglected aerosol forcing evolution in RCMs. It also suggests that it is important to be very careful when using the multi-model Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) projections for solar radiation and related variables, and argues for the inclusion of aerosol forcing evolution in the next generation of CORDEX simulations.},

Temperatures in Central Asia have risen significantly within the last decades whereas mean precipitation remains almost unchanged. However, climatic trends can vary greatly between different subregions, across altitudinal levels, and within seasons. Investigating in the seasonally and spatially differentiated trend characteristics amplifies the knowledge of regional climate change and fosters the understanding of potential impacts on social, ecological, and natural systems. Considering the known limitations of available climate data in this region, this study combines both high-resolution and long-term records to achieve the best possible results. Temperature and precipitation data were analyzed using Climatic Research Unit (CRU) TS 4.01 and NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43. To study long-term trends and low-frequency variations, we performed a linear trend analysis and compiled anomaly time series and regional grid-based trend maps. The results show a strong increase in temperature, almost uniform across the topographically complex study site, with particular maxima in winter and spring. Precipitation depicts minor positive trends, except for spring when precipitation is decreasing. Expected differences in the development of temperature and precipitation between mountain areas and plains could not be detected.},

abstract = {Robust projections and predictions of climate variability and change, particularly at regional scales, rely on the driving processes being represented with fidelity in model simulations. The role of enhanced horizontal resolution in improved process representation in all components of the climate system is of growing interest, particularly as some recent simulations suggest the possibility for significant changes in both large-scale aspects of circulation, as well as improvements in small-scale processes and extremes. However, such high resolution global simulations at climate time scales, with resolutions of at least 50 km in the atmosphere and 0.25° in the ocean, have been performed at relatively few research centers and generally without overall coordination, primarily due to their computational cost. Assessing the robustness of the response of simulated climate to model resolution requires a large multi-model ensemble using a coordinated set of experiments. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) is the ideal framework within which to conduct such a study, due to the strong link to models being developed for the CMIP DECK experiments and other MIPs. Increases in High Performance Computing (HPC) resources, as well as the revised experimental design for CMIP6, now enables a detailed investigation of the impact of increased resolution up to synoptic weather scales on the simulated mean climate and its variability. The High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) presented in this paper applies, for the first time, a multi-model approach to the systematic investigation of the impact of horizontal resolution. A coordinated set of experiments has been designed to assess both a standard and an enhanced horizontal resolution simulation in the atmosphere and ocean. The set of HighResMIP experiments is divided into three tiers consisting of atmosphere-only and coupled runs and spanning the period 1950-2050, with the possibility to extend to 2100, together with some additional targeted experiments. This paper describes the experimental set-up of HighResMIP, the analysis plan, the connection with the other CMIP6 endorsed MIPs, as well as the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulation. HighResMIP thereby focuses on one of the CMIP6 broad questions: “what are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?”, but we also discuss how it addresses the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) grand challenges.},

Analysis and nowcasting fields include temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation amount, precipitation type, cloudiness, and global radiation. The analysis part of the system combines surface station data with remote sensing data in such a way that the observations at the station locations are reproduced, whereas the remote sensing data provide the spatial structure for the interpolation. The nowcasting part employs classical correlation-based motion vectors derived from previous consecutive analyses. In the case of precipitation the nowcast includes an intensity-dependent elevation effect. After 2-6 h of forecast time the nowcast is merged into an NWP forecast provided by a limited-area model, using a predefined temporal weighting function. Cross validation of the analysis and verification of the nowcast are performed. Analysis quality is high for temperature, but comparatively low for wind and precipitation, because of the limited representativeness of station data in mountainous terrain, which can be only partially compensated by the analysis algorithm. Significant added value of the system compared to the NWP forecast is found in the first few hours of the nowcast. At longer lead times the effects of the latest observations becomes small, but in the case of temperature the downscaling of the NWP forecast within the INCA system continues to provide some improvement compared to the direct NWP output. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This study investigated potential future climate changes over East Asia with a focus on temperature variation and changes in precipitation as well as future changes in the East Asian monsoon system. The current and future climate projection scenarios are downscaled over East Asia using the regional spectral model (RSM). The representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios driven by the Hadley Center Global Environmental Model version 2 (HG2) are used to provide large-scale forcing for the RSM downscaling simulations. Simulations were conducted for the current climate from 1980 to 2005 and two types of future climate between 2020 and 2100. Near-future (2025–2050) and far-future (2075–2100) climate simulations are compared with the current (1980–2005) climatology to investigate climatic change over East Asia. The RSM well captures the precipitation and temperature distribution related to the East Asian summer and winter monsoon and mesoscale mountain range with added values, although the wet and cold biases are aggravated in the RSM downscaling. Additionally, short time-scale phenomena such as daily mean temperature and daily precipitation are more accurately reproduced by the RSM than by the HG2. From future climate projection, the increasing temperature trends of each RCP scenario are consistently reproduced in the RSM downscaling; in particular, the result from the RCP 8.5 experiment shows a significantly steeper trend with increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the East Asian monsoon is intensified in the future climate projection by the strengthening North Pacific subtropical high and Okhotsk high in summer and intensified Siberian high in winter. These changes lead to an increase in precipitation for summer and a decrease for winter.},

abstract = {AbstractThe Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) is a fully coupled, regional Earth system model applied over the pan-Arctic domain. This paper discusses the implementation of the Variable Infiltration Capacity land surface model (VIC) in RASM and evaluates the ability of RASM, version 1.0, to capture key features of the land surface climate and hydrologic cycle for the period 1979–2014 in comparison with uncoupled VIC simulations, reanalysis datasets, satellite measurements, and in situ observations. RASM reproduces the dominant features of the land surface climatology in the Arctic, such as the amount and regional distribution of precipitation, the partitioning of precipitation between runoff and evapotranspiration, the effects of snow on the water and energy balance, and the differences in turbulent fluxes between the tundra and taiga biomes. Surface air temperature biases in RASM, compared to reanalysis datasets ERA-Interim and MERRA, are generally less than 2°C; however, in the cold seasons there are ...},

abstract = {The influences of agricultural irrigation on trends in surface air temperature from 1959 to 2006 over Xinjiang, Northwest China are evaluated using data from 90 meteorological stations. The 90 stations are located in landscapes with markedly different cultivated land uses. The increasing trends in daily average temperature (Ta), maximum temperature (Tmax), and minimum temperature (Tmin) for May-September (the main growing season) are negatively correlated with cultivated land proportions within 4 km of the meteorological stations, as indicated by year 2000 land use data. The correlations between the trends in Tmax and cultivated land proportions are the most significant. The trends in Ta, T max, and Tmin for May-September are expected to decrease by -0.018, -0.014, and -0.016 ° C per decade, respectively, along with a 10{\%} increase in cultivated land proportion. As irrigated cultivated land occupies over 90{\%} of total cultivated land, the dependence of temperature trends on cultivated area is attributed to irrigation. The cooling effects on stations with cultivated land proportion larger than 50{\%} are compared to temperature trends in a reference group with cultivated land proportion smaller than 10{\%}. The irrigation expansion from 1959 to 2006 over Xinjiang is found to be associated with cooling of May-September Ta, Tmax, and Tmin by around -0.15 ° C to -0.10 ° C/decade in the station group with extensive irrigation. Short periods of rapid irrigation expansion co-occurred with the significant cooling of the May-September temperature. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Here, in an update of our previous ISMASS paper (Hanna et al., 2013), we review recent observational estimates of ice sheet and glacier mass balance, and their related uncertainties, first briefly considering relevant monitoring methods. Focusing on the response to climate change during 1992–2018, and especially the post-IPCC AR5 period, we discuss recent changes in the relative contributions of ice sheets and glaciers to sea-level change. We assess recent advances in understanding of the relative importance of surface mass balance and ice dynamics in overall ice-sheet mass change. We also consider recent improvements in ice-sheet modelling, highlighting data-model linkages and the use of updated observational datasets in ice-sheet models. Finally, by identifying key deficiencies in the observations and models that hamper current understanding and limit reliability of future ice-sheet projections, we make recommendations to the research community for reducing these knowledge gaps. Our synthesis aims to provide a critical and timely review of the current state of the science in advance of the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report that is due in 2021.},

abstract = {Much uncertainty exists in reproducing Arctic temperature using different general circulation models (GCMs). Therefore, evaluating the performance of GCMs in reproducing Arctic temperature is critically important. In our study, 32 GCMs in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) during the period 1900–2005 are used, and several metrics, i.e., bias, correlation coefficient (R), and root mean square error (RMSE), are applied. The Cowtan data set is adopted as the reference data. The results suggest that the GCMs used can reasonably reproduce the Arctic warming trend during the period 1900–2005, as observed in the observational data, whereas a large variation of inter-model differences exists in modeling the Arctic warming magnitude. With respect to the reference data, most GCMs have large cold biases, whereas others have weak warm biases. Additionally, based on statistical thresholds, the models MIROC-ESM, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, HadGEM2-AO, and MIROC-ESM-CHEM (bias ≤ ±0.10 °C, R ≥ 0.50, and RMSE ≤ 0.60 °C) are identified as well-performing GCMs. The ensemble of the four best-performing GCMs (ES4), with bias, R, and RMSE values of −0.03 °C, 0.72, and 0.39 °C, respectively, performs better than the ensemble with all 32 members, with bias, R, and RMSE values of −0.04 °C, 0.64, and 0.43 °C, respectively. Finally, ES4 is used to produce projections for the next century under the scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.0. The uncertainty in the projected temperature is greater in the higher emissions scenarios. Additionally, the projected temperature in the cold half year has larger variations than that in the warm half year.},

The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.},

abstract = {Recent climate projections indicate substantial environmental alterations in oceanic island regions during the 21st century, setting up profound threats to insular floras. Inherent characteristics of island species and ecosystems (e.g. small population sizes, low habitat availability, isolated evolution, low functional redundancy) cause a particular vulnerability. Strong local anthropogenic pressures interact with climate change impacts and increase threats. Owing to the high degree of endemism in their floras, a disproportionally high potential for global biodiversity loss originates from climate change impacts on oceanic islands. We reviewed a growing body of research, finding evidence of emerging climate change influences as well as high potentials of future impacts on insular species and ecosystems. Threats from global climate change are not evenly distributed among the world's oceanic islands but rather vary with intrinsic (e.g. island area, structure, age and ecological complexity) and extrinsic factors (regional character, magnitude and rate of climatic alterations, local human influences). The greatest flora vulnerabilities to climate change impacts can be expected on islands of small area, low elevation and homogeneous topography. Islands of low functional redundancies will particularly suffer from high rates of co-modifications and co-extinctions due to climate-change-driven disruptions of ecological interactions. High threat potentials come from synergistic interactions between different factors, especially between climatic changes and local anthropogenic encroachments on native species and ecosystems. In addition, human responses to climate change can cause strong indirect impacts on island floras, making highly populated islands very vulnerable to secondary (derivative) effects. We provide an integrated overview of climate change-driven processes affecting oceanic island plants and depict knowledge gaps and uncertainties. The suitability of oceanic islands and their ecosystems for potential research on the field of climate change ecology is highlighted and implications for adequate research approaches are given.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the Mediterranean Sea heat budget components from a set of forced and coupled simulations performed in the frame of the Med-CORDEX project. The simulations use regional climate system models (RCSMs) dedicated to the Mediterranean area and driven by the ERA40/ERA-Interim reanalyses. The study focuses on the period 1980–2010. Interannual variations of the average net heat flux at the sea surface are consistent among models but the spread in the mean values is large (from −4.8 to +2.2 Wm−2) with the coupled models showing the lowest heat loss from the sea. For the heat flux at the Strait of Gibraltar both interannual variations and mean values show a large intermodel spread. The basin average temperature shows positive trends with highest values in the coupled models; it also shows interannual variations that are in good agreement with observations. The heat content rate is calculated based on the derivative of the average temperature and is found to be significantly correlated for most models with the net heat flux at the sea surface (average correlation {\~{}}0.5) but not with the net heat flux through the Strait of Gibraltar (average correlation {\~{}}0.2), suggesting that in the considered RCSMs the interannual variability of the heat content rate is mainly driven by the surface heat fluxes. The resemblance between the simulated and observed heat content rates is stronger in the forced models than in the coupled ones. This is explained by the stronger constraint applied to the forced models by the use of the surface temperature relaxation to observations. The temperature of the outflowing water through the Strait of Gibraltar shows positive and significant trends, also higher in the coupled models. It is suggested that the Mediterranean Sea warming found in most models and in particular in the coupled ones, induces a change of the hydrographic conditions that affects the Strait of Gibraltar.},

The traditional approach uses ensembles of climate model simulations, statistical bias correction, downscaling to the spatial and temporal scales relevant to decision-makers, and then translation into quantities of interest. The veracity of this approach cannot be tested, and it faces in-principle challenges. Alternatively, numerical weather prediction models in a hypothetical climate setting can provide tailored narratives for high-resolution simulations of high-impact weather in a future climate.

abstract = {The Arctic Oscillation (AO), which depicts a most dominant large-scale seesaw between the mid-latitudes and Arctic atmospheric mass, influences climate over Eurasia, North America, eastern Canada, North Africa, and the Middle East, especially during boreal winter. This review, with a special focus on the East Asian region, summarizes the climatic impact of AO. It begins with a description of the spatial structure of AO and the related climatic anomalies. The relationship of winter AO with the simultaneous East Asian winter climate (e.g. the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), cold surges/cold waves, and precipitation) and its instability are then followed. It is generally accepted that, through impacting the Siberian high, westerly wind, blocking frequency, Rossby wave activities etc., a positive phase of winter AO is associated with a weaker-than-normal EAWM, warmer conditions in East Asia, less frequency of cold surges/cold waves, increasing (decreasing) of winter precipitation in south (north) parts of East Asia; and vice versa. Notably, the pathways that the winter AO exerts impact are different. Besides, the AO-EAWM and the AO-cold surges/cold wave linkages have spatial and temporal variations. Subsequently, an overview of the inter-seasonal linkages between the East Asian summer monsoon with the preceding spring/winter AO is presented. There is a generally accepted knowledge that a positive spring AO is followed by significant positive summer precipitation anomalies in southern China and western Pacific as well as negative ones in the lower valley of Yangtze River and southern Japan. Finally, this review synthesizes the impact of winter/spring AO on the East Asian spring climate (e.g. dust storm, temperature, and precipitation) and discusses the potential predictive value of AO. The projection of AO and its impact on the East Asian climate in future has been barely explored. We conclude that, along with the long-term observation data, the linkage between AO and the East Asian climate on the sub-seasonal and decadal time scales, how tropical and extratropical forcing modulates the linkage and how the linkage evolves under future warming conditions should be more investigated. Notably, the change of AO during 1990–2013 winters could explain the Eurasian cooling but failed to explain the Arctic warming. In the future, the effect of Ural blocking on Arctic and Eurasian climate and their connection might be a hot topic.},

abstract = {Coupled climate system models consistently show that the low-level southerly wind associated with the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is enhanced under anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing, and the enhanced EASM was attributed to the enhanced land–sea thermal contrast by previous studies. Based on a comparison of the global warming scenarios with the present-day climate in an ensemble of 30 coupled models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), we show evidence that changes in land–sea thermal contrast cannot explain the enhanced EASM circulation in terms of the seasonality. Indeed, the enhanced low-level southerly wind over East Asia is associated with a large-scale anomalous cyclone around the Tibetan Plateau (TP), and numerical simulation by the Linear Baroclinic Model suggests that the enhanced latent heating over the TP associated with enhanced precipitation is responsible for this low-level cyclone anomaly and the enhanced EASM circulation projected by the coupled models. Moisture budget analysis shows that enhanced hydrological recycling and enhanced vertical moisture advection due to increased specific humidity have the largest contribution to the increased precipitation over the TP, and more than half of the intermodel uncertainty in the projected change of EASM circulation is associated with the uncertainty in the changes of precipitation over the TP. Therefore, the TP plays an essential role in enhancing the EASM circulation under global warming through enhanced latent heating over the TP.},

We use three relatively high resolved downscalings of one global coupled model: the Arp{\`{e}}ge global atmospheric model (stretched grid with 35-km horizontal resolution over Norway) and the WRF-downscaled Arp{\`{e}}ge model (30 and 10-km) for the 30-year periods of 1961-1990 and 2021-2050. The cluster analysis finds three main SLP patterns responsible for extreme precipitation in different parts of the country. The SLP patterns found are similar to the NAO positive pattern known to strengthen the westerly flow towards European coast. We then apply the method to investigate future change in extreme precipitation. We find an increase in the number of days with extreme precipitation of 15, 39 and 35{\%} in the two simulations (Arp{\`{e}}ge 35-km and WRF 30 and 10-km, respectively). We do not find evidence of a significant change in the frequency of weather patterns between the present and the future periods. Rather, it is the probability of a given weather pattern to cause extreme precipitation which is increased in the future, probably due to higher temperatures and an increased moisture content of the air. The WRF model predicts the increase in this probability caused by the most important SLP patterns to be {\textgreater}50{\%}. The Arp{\`{e}}ge model does not predict such a significant change because the general increase in extreme precipitation predicted is smaller, probably due to its coarser resolution over ocean which leads to smoother representation of the low pressure systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Recent years (i.e., 2007-2014) have exhibited large declines in snow cover extent (SCE) in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), marked by earlier snowmelt in the springtime. In Northern latitudes, the snow-albedo feedback (SAF) is most pronounced in the spring and may be contributing to these decreasing trends in SCE. Rising surface air temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns could also vary the declining trends in SCE depending on latitude and elevation. Previous trend analyses of NH SCE are extended here to cover the period 1 October 1971 to 30 September 2014 using observed data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration snow chart climate data record. Trends in snow coverage (significant when p {\textless} 0.05) with latitude and elevation are investigated using the Mann-Kendall test. Over the 43 year period, strong polar amplification of negative trends in snow cover are observed. The majority of statistically significant negative trends are found in the mid- to high-latitudes, reaching a maximum reduction at 75.5°N. There is also elevation dependence of SCE over time as statistically significant negative trends occur at most elevations, with the strongest observed at 3950 m a.s.l. These significant negative trends exhibited in the mid- to high-latitudes and mid- to high-elevations provide evidence of polar amplification and elevation dependence of trends in snow cover in a warming climate, suggesting a leading role of the SAF on the recent retreat of NH snow cover.},

Between 2013 and 2016, the Caribbean experienced a widespread drought due in part to El Ni{\~{n}}o in 2015–2016, but it is unknown whether its severity was exacerbated by anthropogenic warming. This work examines the role of recent warming on this drought, using a recently developed high-resolution self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index data set. The resulting analysis suggest that anthropogenic warming accounted for {\~{}}15–17{\%} of the drought's severity and {\~{}}7{\%} of its spatial extent. These findings strongly suggest that climate model projected anthropogenic drying in the Caribbean is already underway, with major implications for the more than 43 million people currently living in this region.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase the severity and frequency of drought in the Caribbean. Understanding drought variability and its trends is therefore critical for improving resiliency and adaptation capacity of this region, as well as for assessing the dynamics and predictability of regional hydroclimate across spatial and temporal scales. This work introduces a first of its kind high-resolution drought dataset for the Caribbean region from 1950 to 2016, using monthly estimates of the “self calibrating” Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI), with the physically based Penman–Monteith approximation for the potential evapotranspiration. Statistically downscaled data products, including reanalysis, are employed to establish an historical baseline for characterizing drought from 1950 to the near present. Since 1950, the Caribbean has been affected by severe droughts in 1974–77, 1997/98, 2009/10, and 2013–16. Results indicate that the 2013–16 drought is the most severe event during the time interval analyzed in this work, which agrees with qualitative reports of many meteorological institutions across the Caribbean. Linear trends in the scPDSI show a significant drying in the study area, averaging an scPDSI change of −0.09 decade−1 (p {\textless} 0.05). However, this trend is not homogenous, and significant trends toward wetter conditions in portions of the study area were observed. Results further indicate a strong influence of both tropical Pacific and North Atlantic oceans in modulating drought variability across the study domain. Finally, this effort is the first step in building high-resolution drought products for the Caribbean to be updated regularly, with the purpose of drought monitoring and eventually seasonal drought prediction.},

abstract = {Abstract. The present work presents a new observational gridded dataset (referred to as Iberia01) for daily precipitation and temperatures produced using a dense network (thousands) of stations over the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1971–2015 at 0.1∘ regular (and 0.11∘ CORDEX-compliant rotated) resolutions. We analyze mean and extreme indices and compare the results with the E-OBS v17 dataset (using both the standard and ensemble versions, at 0.25 and 0.1∘ resolutions, respectively), in order to assess observational uncertainty in this region. We show that Iberia01 produces more realistic precipitation patterns than E-OBS for the mean and extreme indices considered, although both are comparable for temperatures. To assess the differences between these datasets, a new probabilistic intercomparison analysis was performed, using the E-OBS ensemble (v17e) to characterize observational uncertainty and testing whether Iberia01 falls within the observational uncertainty range provided by E-OBS. In general, uncertainty values are large in the whole territory, with the exception of a number of kernels where the uncertainty is small, corresponding to the stations used to build the E-OBS grid. For precipitation, significant differences – at the 10 {\%} level – between both datasets were found for fewer than 25 {\%} of days over the Iberian Peninsula. For temperature, a very inhomogeneous spatial pattern was obtained, with either a small (in most of the regions) or large fraction of significantly different days, thus indicating sensible regions for observational uncertainty. Iberia01 is publicly available (Herrera et al., 2019a, https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/8641).},

abstract = {High spatial resolution of precipitation (P) and average air temperature (Tavg) datasets are ideal for determining the spatial patterns associated with large-scale atmospheric and oceanic indexes, and climate change and variability studies, however such datasets are not usually available. Those datasets are particularly important for Central America because they allow the conception of climate variability and climate change studies in a region of high climatic heterogeneity and at the same time aid the decisionmaking process at the local scale (municipalities and districts). Tavg data from stations and complementary gridded datasets at 50 km resolution were used to generate a high-resolution (5 km grid) dataset for Central America from 1970 to 1999. A highresolution P dataset was used along with the new Tavg dataset to study climate variability and a climate change application. Consistently with other studies, it was found that the 1970-1999 trends in P are generally non-significant, with the exception of a few small locations. In the case of Tavg, there were significant warming trends in most of Central America, and cooling trends in Honduras and northern Panama. When the sea surface temperature anomalies between the Tropical Pacific and the Tropical Atlantic have different (same) sign, they are a good indicator of the sign of P (Tavg) annual anomalies. Even with non-significant trends in precipitation, the significant warming trends in Tavg in most of Central America can have severe consequences in the hydrology and water availability of the region, as the warming would bring increases in evapotranspiration, drier soils and higher aridity.},

Limited prior Antarctic cloud observations have slowed the progress of numerical weather prediction in this region. The AWARE observations from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide during December 2015 and January 2016 are used to evaluate the operational forecasts of the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) and new simulations with the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) 3.9.1. The Polar WRF 3.9.1 simulations are conducted with the WRF single-moment 5-class microphysics (WSM5C) used by the AMPS and with newer generation microphysics schemes. The AMPS simulates few liquid clouds during summer at the WAIS Divide, which is inconsistent with observations of frequent low-level liquid clouds. Polar WRF 3.9.1 simulations show that this result is a consequence of WSM5C. More advanced microphysics schemes simulate more cloud liquid water and produce stronger cloud radiative forcing, resulting in downward longwave and shortwave radiation at the surface more in agreement with observations. Similarly, increased cloud fraction is simulated with the more advanced microphysics schemes. All of the simulations, however, produce smaller net cloud fractions than observed. Ice water paths vary less between the simulations than liquid water paths. The colder and drier atmosphere driven by the Global Forecast System (GFS) initial and boundary conditions for AMPS forecasts produces lesser cloud amounts than the Polar WRF 3.9.1 simulations driven by ERA-Interim.},

Projections vary considerably between regions, and also among the glacier models. Global glacier mass changes per degree global air temperature rise tend to increase with more pronounced warming indicating that mass-balance sensitivities to temperature change are not constant. Differences in glacier mass projections among the models are attributed to differences in model physics, calibration and downscaling procedures, initial ice volumes and varying ensembles of forcing GCMs.},

abstract = {Two theories for observed East Africa drying trends during March–May 1979–2013 are reconciled. Both hypothesize that variations in tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) caused East Africa drying. The first invokes a mainly human cause resulting from sensitivity to secular warming of Indo–western Pacific SSTs. The second invokes a mainly natural cause resulting from sensitivity to a strong articulation of ENSO-like Pacific decadal variability involving warming of the western Pacific and cooling of the central Pacific. Historical atmospheric model simulations indicate that observed SST variations contributed significantly to the East Africa drying trend during March–May 1979–2013. By contrast, historical coupled model simulations suggest that external radiative forcing alone, including the ocean's response to that forcing, did not contribute significantly to East Africa drying. Recognizing that the observed SST variations involved a commingling of natural and anthropogenic effects, this study diagnosed how East African rainfall sensitivity was conditionally dependent on the interplay of those factors. East African rainfall trends in historical coupled models were intercompared between two composites of ENSO-like decadal variability, one operating in the early twentieth century before appreciable global warming and the other in the early twenty-first century of strong global warming. The authors find the coaction of global warming with ENSO-like decadal variability can significantly enhance 35-yr East Africa drying trends relative to when the natural mode of ocean variability acts alone. A human-induced change via its interplay with an extreme articulation of natural variability may thus have been key to Africa drying; however, these results are speculative owing to differences among two independent suites of coupled model ensembles.},

abstract = {Future climate projections show a marked increase in Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) runoff during the 21st century, a direct consequence of the Polar Amplification signal. Regional climate models (RCMs) are a widely used tool to downscale ensembles of projections from global climate models (GCMs) to assess the impact of global warming on GrIS melt and sea level rise contribution. Initial results of the CMIP6 GCM model intercomparison project have revealed a greater 21st century temperature rise than in CMIP5 models. However, so far very little is known about the subsequent impacts on the future GrIS surface melt and therefore sea level rise contribution. Here, we show that the total GrIS sea level rise contribution from surface mass loss in our high-resolution (15 km) regional climate projections is 17.8 ± 7.8 cm in SSP585, 7.9 cm more than in our RCP8.5 simulations using CMIP5 input. We identify a +1.3 °C greater Arctic Amplification and associated cloud and sea ice feedbacks in the CMIP6 SSP585 scenario as the main drivers. Additionally, an assessment of the GrIS sea level contribution across all emission scenarios highlights, that the GrIS mass loss in CMIP6 is equivalent to a CMIP5 scenario with twice the global radiative forcing.},

abstract = {Changes in climatic parameters are often given in terms of global averages even though large regional variability is generally observed. The study of regional tendencies provides not only supplementary conclusions to more large-scale oriented results but is also of particular interest to local policy-makers and resource managers to have detailed information regarding sensible and influential climatic parameters. In this study, changes in precipitation for the Balearic Islands (Spain) have been analyzed using data from 18 rain gauges with complete daily time series during the period 1951-2006 and two additional sites where only monthly totals were available. Tendencies for maximum and minimum 2-m temperatures have also been derived using data from three thermometric stations with daily time series for the period 1976-2006. The thermometric stations are located at the head of the runways in the airports of the three major islands of the archipelago, where urbanization has arguably not had a relevant impact on the registered values. The annual mean temperature in the mid-troposphere and lower stratosphere has also been analyzed using the Balearics radiosonde data for the period 1981-2006. Results show there is a negative tendency for annual precipitation (163 mm per century) with 85{\%} significance on the sign of the trend. An abrupt decrease in mean yearly precipitation of 65 mm is objectively detected in the time series around 1980. Additionally, the analysis shows that light and heavy daily precipitation (up to 4 mm and above 64 mm, respectively) increase their contribution to the total annual, while the share from moderate-heavy precipitations (16-32 mm) is decreasing. Regarding the thermometric records, minimum temperatures increased at a rate of 5.8°C per century during the 31 years and maximum temperatures also increased at a rate of 5.0°C per century, both having a level of statistical significance for the sign of the linear trend above 99{\%}. Temperatures in the mid-troposphere decreased at a rate of - 5.4°C per century while a tendency of - 7.8°C per century is found in the lower stratosphere. The level of statistical significance for the sign of both the tropospheric and stratospheric linear trends is above 98{\%} despite the great inter-annual variability of both series. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {Through extensive modeling efforts, it has been established that the ongoing global warming will increase the overall precipitation associated with the East Asian summer monsoon, but the future change of its spatial distribution has not reached a consensus. In this study, meridional shifts of the mei-yu–baiu rainband are studied in association with the subtropical jet by using outputs from atmosphere–ocean coupled climate models provided by CMIP5. The models reproduce observed associations between the jet and precipitation over wide time scales from synoptic to interannual. The same relation is found in intermodel differences in simulated climatology, so that the meridional locations of the jet and baiu precipitation are positively correlated. The multimodel-mean projection suggests that the both are shifted southward by the late twenty-first century. This shift is not inconsistent with the projected tropical expansion, not only because the change is local but also because the projected tropical expansion occurs mainly in the Southern Hemisphere. No significant future change in the continental mei-yu precipitation location is identified, which might be because the jet change is weak there. For comparison, the summertime Atlantic jet position, which shifts northward, is investigated briefly. This study suggests that the future change of the subtropical jet is an important aspect to investigate possible future changes of the baiu rainband, and it prompts further studies including the role of the ocean.},

abstract = {In southern Africa, models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) predict robust future drying associated with a delayed rainy-season onset in the austral spring and a range of wetting and drying patterns in the austral summer. This paper relates these rainfall changes to dynamical shifts in two classes of weather systems: the Congo Air Boundary (CAB) and tropical lows. Objective algorithms are used to track these features in CMIP5 model output. It is then established that the climatological locations and frequencies of these systems are reasonably well represented in the CMIP5 models. RCP8.5 end-of-twenty-first-century projections are compared with historical end-of-twentieth-century simulations. Future projections in tropical-low locations and frequencies diverge, but indicate an overall average decrease of 15{\%} and in some cases a northward shift. The projected spatial change in the tropical-low frequency distribution is weakly positively correlated to the projected spatial change in the austral summer rainfall distribution. Meanwhile, future projections indicate a 13{\%} increase in CAB frequency from October to December. This is associated with the gradual climatological CAB breakdown occurring half a month later on average in end-of-twenty-first-century RCP8.5 projections. A delay in the gradual seasonal decline of the CAB prevents rainfall to the south of the CAB's mean position, most of which is shown to occur on CAB breakdown days, hence creating the austral spring drying signal and delayed wet-season onset. Intermodel variability in the magnitude of CAB frequency increase is able to explain intermodel variability in the projected drying.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This study examines the temporal variations and spatial distributions of annual precipitation over Central Asia during the periods of 1901?2013, 1951?2013, and 1979?2013 using the latest version of Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) full data reanalysis version 7 (GPCC V7) data set. The linear trend and multiperiods of the precipitation over the entire region and plain and mountainous area separately are analysed by linear least square method and ensemble empirical mode decomposition method. An overall increasing trend [0.66 mm (10 years)?1] is found for the entire region during 1901?2013, which is smaller than that of 1951?2013. The regional annual precipitation exhibits multi-decadal variations, with a sharp decline during 1901?1944, followed by an increase until 1980s, and a fluctuation thereafter. During 1979?2013, the mountainous area shows a greater increasing trend than the entire region. Furthermore, the regional annual precipitation has exhibited high-frequency variations with 3-year and 6-year quasiperiods and a low-frequency variation with 28-year quasiperiods. In terms of the spatial distribution, increasing trend in the annual precipitation is found in Xinjiang and decreasing trends appear over the five countries of Central Asia during 1951?2013. Empirical orthogonal function results show that the mountainous area is the large variability centre of the annual precipitation. The dominant mode of interannual variability in Central Asia annual precipitation is related to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation, which explains about 17{\%} of the interannual variance during 1951?2013. The results of this study describe the long-term variation in the annual precipitation over Central Asia as well as its relationship with some key climate indices in great detail, which will benefit the understanding and the prediction of the climate variations in this region.},

abstract = {AbstractThe arid and semiarid region in central Asia is sensitive and vulnerable to climate variations. However, the sparse and highly unevenly distributed meteorological stations in the region provide limited data for understanding of the region?s climate variations. In this study, the near-surface air temperature change in central Asia from 1979 to 2011 was examined using observations from 81 meteorological stations, three local observation validated reanalysis datasets of relatively high spatial resolutions, and the Climate Research Unit (CRU) dataset. Major results suggested that the three reanalysis datasets match well with most of the local climate records, especially in the low-lying plain areas. The consensus of the multiple datasets showed significant regional surface air temperature increases of 0.36°?0.42°C decade?1 in the past 33 years. No significant contributions from declining irrigation and urbanization to temperature change were found. The rate is larger in recent years than in the early years in the study period. Additionally, unlike in many regions in the world, the temperature in winter showed no increase in central Asia in the last three decades, a noticeable departure from the global trend in the twentieth century. The largest increase in surface temperature was occurring in the spring season. Analyses further showed a warming center in the middle of the central Asian states and weakened temperature variability along the northwest?southeast temperature gradient from the northern Kazakhstan to southern Xinjiang. The reanalysis datasets also showed significant negative correlations between temperature increase rate and elevation in this complex terrain region.},

abstract = {The monthly global 2° × 2° Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) has been revised and updated from version 4 to version 5. This update incorporates a new release of ICOADS release 3.0 (R3.0), a decade of near-surface data from Argo floats, and a new estimate of centennial sea ice from HadISST2. A number of choices in aspects of quality control, bias adjustment, and interpolation have been substantively revised. The resulting ERSST estimates have more realistic spatiotemporal variations, better representation of high-latitude SSTs, and ship SST biases are now calculated relative to more accurate buoy measurements, while the global long-term trend remains about the same. Progressive experiments have been undertaken to highlight the effects of each change in data source and analysis technique upon the final product. The reconstructed SST is systematically decreased by 0.077°C, as the reference data source is switched from ship SST in ERSSTv4 to modern buoy SST in ERSSTv5. Furthermore, high-latitude SSTs are decreased by 0.1°–0.2°C by using sea ice concentration from HadISST2 over HadISST1. Changes arising from remaining innovations are mostly important at small space and time scales, primarily having an impact where and when input observations are sparse. Cross validations and verifications with independent modern observations show that the updates incorporated in ERSSTv5 have improved the representation of spatial variability over the global oceans, the magnitude of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events, and the decadal nature of SST changes over 1930s–40s when observation instruments changed rapidly. Both long- (1900–2015) and short-term (2000–15) SST trends in ERSSTv5 remain significant as in ERSSTv4.},

abstract = {Realistically representing the Arctic amplification in global climate models (GCMs) represents a key to accurately predict the climate system's response to increasing anthropogenic forcings. We examined the amplified Arctic warming over the past century simulated by 36 state-of-the-art GCMs against observation. We found a clear difference between the simulations and the observation in terms of the evolution of the secular warming rates. The observed rates of the secular Arctic warming increase from 0.14 °C/10a in the early 1890s to 0.21 °C/10a in the mid-2010s, while the GCMs show a negligible trend to 0.35 °C/10a at the corresponding times. The overestimation of the secular warming rate in the GCMs starts from the mid-twentieth century and aggravates with time. Further analysis indicates that the overestimation mainly comes from the exaggerated heating contribution from the Arctic sea ice melting. This result implies that the future secular Arctic warming may have been over-projected.},

Under different emission scenarios during the twenty-first century, the climatic mean and ISD (long-term trends) of the annual precipitation over CA projected by the five best models' ensemble mean show very similar (quite different) spatial patterns to those in the twentieth century. Relatively stronger increasing rates (over 3 mm decade−1 in RCP2.6 and over 6 mm decade−1 in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are located over northern CA and the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Compared to the situations in the twentieth century, the climatic mean, ISD, and long-term trends of the projected annual precipitation over most of CA under different emission scenarios exhibit robust increasing changes during the twenty-first century. The projected increasing changes in the climatic mean (ISD) of the CA annual mean range from 10{\%} to 35{\%} (10{\%}–90{\%}) under different emission scenarios with relatively large increases over Xinjiang, China (northern CA and Xinjiang). The increasing trends of the annual precipitation over most of CA are projected to intensify with relatively large increases (over 3–9 mm decade−1) located over northern CA, the Tian Shan Mountains, and northern Tibet during the twenty-first century. In addition, the intensities of the increasing changes in the climatic mean, ISD, and trends of CA annual precipitation are intensified with the emissions increased correspondingly. Further analyses of the possible mechanisms related to the projected changes in precipitation indicate that the increases of the annual precipitation over CA in the twenty-first century are mainly attributed to the enhanced precipitable water that results from strengthened water vapor transport and surface evaporation.},

abstract = {In recent decades, the Greenland Ice Sheet has been a major contributor to global sea-level rise1,2, and it is expected to be so in the future3. Although increases in glacier flow4–6 and surface melting7–9 have been driven by oceanic10–12 and atmospheric13,14 warming, the degree and trajectory of today's imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual satellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet's volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. Although the ice sheet was close to a state of balance in the 1990s, annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 335 ± 62 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,800 ± 339 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.6 ± 0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that reduced surface mass balance has driven 1,971 ± 555 billion tonnes (52{\%}) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,827 ± 538 billion tonnes (48{\%}) of ice loss was due to increased glacier discharge, which rose from 41 ± 37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 ± 25 billion tonnes per year since then. Between 2013 and 2017, the total rate of ice loss slowed to 217 ± 32 billion tonnes per year, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured cooler conditions15 and as ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}16. Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the IPCC's predicted rates for their high-end climate warming scenario17, which forecast an additional 50 to 120 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 when compared to their central estimate.},

The climatic trends at the end of the 20th — beginning of the 21st centuries for the ATR as a whole as well as for its separate regions were assessed through comparison of temperature and pressure variability indices for two time intervals: 1975–2005, and 1982–2012. It was established that climatic changes during 1982–2012 continued to manifest themselves in a rise of mean annual surface air temperature; however, the warming process was less intense than during 1975–2005. A large role in the decrease of the temperature growth rates is played by the winter months when the warming process is replaced by the cooling process. Furthermore, the latter time interval showed a tendency for an increase in pressure.},

The two driving data sets ERA-Interim reanalysis and the general circulation model EC-Earth have been analyzed besides the RCA4 simulations to address the added value. RCA4 successfully captures the mean climate in both the seasons. The biases in RCA4 appear to come from the driving data sets which are amplified after downscaling. The jet streams influencing the seasonal precipitation variability in both seasons are also analyzed. The spatial and quantitative analysis over CORDEX South Asia generally revealed the ability of RCA4 to capture the mean seasonal climate as well as the position and strength of the jet streams despite weak/strong jet representation in the driving data. The EC-Earth downscaled with RCA4 exhibited cold biases over the domain and a weak Somali jet over the Arabian Sea. Moreover, the moisture transport from the Arabian Sea during summer is pronounced in RCA4 simulations resulting in enhanced monsoon rainfall over northwestern parts of India. Both the Somali jet and the tropical easterly jet become stronger during strong summer monsoon years. However, there is robust impact of wet years in summer over the Somali jet. Wet-minus-dry composites in winter indicate strengthening (weakening) of the subtropical jet in RCA4 run by ERA-Interim (EC-Earth). The driving data have clear reflections on the RCA4 simulations.},

abstract = {Spitsbergen has experienced some of the most severe temperature changes in the Arctic during the last three decades. This study relates the recent warming to variations in large-scale atmospheric circulation (AC), air mass characteristics, and sea ice concentration (SIC), both regionally around Spitsbergen and locally in three fjords. We find substantial warming for all AC patterns for all seasons, with greatest temperature increase in winter. A major part of the warming can be attributed to changes in air mass characteristics associated with situations of both cyclonic and anticyclonic air advection from north and east and situations with a nonadvectional anticyclonic ridge. In total, six specific AC types (out of 21), which occur on average 41{\%} of days in a year, contribute approximately 80{\%} of the recent warming. The relationship between the land-based surface air temperature (SAT) and local and regional SIC was highly significant, particularly for the most contributing AC types. The high correlation between SAT and SIC for air masses from east and north of Spitsbergen suggests that a major part of the atmospheric warming observed in Spitsbergen is driven by heat exchange from the larger open water area in the Barents Sea and region north of Spitsbergen. Finally, our results show that changes in frequencies of AC play a minor role to the total recent surface warming. Thus, the strong warming in Spitsbergen in the latest decades is not driven by increased frequencies of ?warm? AC types but rather from sea ice decline, higher sea surface temperatures, and a general background warming.},

abstract = {Ensembles of climate change projections created by general circulation models (GCMs) with high resolution are increasingly needed to develop adaptation strategies for regional climate change. The Meteorological Research Institute atmospheric GCM version 3.2 (MRI-AGCM3.2), which is listed in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), has been typically run with resolutions of 60 km and 20 km. Ensembles of MRI-AGCM3.2 consist of members with multiple cumulus convection schemes and different patterns of future sea surface temperature, and are utilized together with their downscaled data; however, the limited size of the high-resolution ensemble may lead to undesirable biases and uncertainty in future climate projections that will limit its appropriateness and effectiveness for studies on climate change and impact assessments. In this study, to develop a comprehensive understanding of the regional precipitation simulated with MRI-AGCM3.2, we investigate how well MRI-AGCM3.2 simulates the present-day regional precipitation around the globe and compare the uncertainty in future precipitation changes and the change projection itself between MRI-AGCM3.2 and the CMIP5 multiple atmosphere–ocean coupled GCM (AOGCM) ensemble. MRI-AGCM3.2 reduces the bias of the regional mean precipitation obtained with the high-performing CMIP5 models, with a reduction of approximately 20{\%} in the bias over the Tibetan Plateau through East Asia and Australia. When 26 global land regions are considered, MRI-AGCM3.2 simulates the spatial pattern and the regional mean realistically in more regions than the individual CMIP5 models. As for the future projections, in 20 of the 26 regions, the sign of annual precipitation change is identical between the 50th percentiles of the MRI-AGCM3.2 ensemble and the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. In the other six regions around the tropical South Pacific, the differences in modeling with and without atmosphere–ocean coupling may affect the projections. The uncertainty in future changes in annual precipitation from MRI-AGCM3.2 partially overlaps the maximum–minimum uncertainty range from the full ensemble of the CMIP5 models in all regions. Moreover, on average over individual regions, the projections from MRI-AGCM3.2 spread over roughly 0.8 of the uncertainty range from the high-performing CMIP5 models compared to 0.4 of the range of the full ensemble.},

abstract = {A new approach for rigorous spatial analysis of the downscaling performance of regional climate model (RCM) simulations is introduced. It is based on a multiple comparison of the local tests at the grid cells and is also known as “field” or “global” significance. New performance measures for estimating the added value of downscaled data relative to the large-scale forcing fields are developed. The methodology is exemplarily applied to a standard EURO-CORDEX hindcast simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the land surface model NOAH at 0.11 ∘ grid resolution. Monthly temperature climatology for the 1990–2009 period is analysed for Germany for winter and summer in comparison with high-resolution gridded observations from the German Weather Service. The field significance test controls the proportion of falsely rejected local tests in a meaningful way and is robust to spatial dependence. Hence, the spatial patterns of the statistically significant local tests are also meaningful. We interpret them from a process-oriented perspective. In winter and in most regions in summer, the downscaled distributions are statistically indistinguishable from the observed ones. A systematic cold summer bias occurs in deep river valleys due to overestimated elevations, in coastal areas due probably to enhanced sea breeze circulation, and over large lakes due to the interpolation of water temperatures. Urban areas in concave topography forms have a warm summer bias due to the strong heat islands, not reflected in the observations. WRF-NOAH generates appropriate fine-scale features in the monthly temperature field over regions of complex topography, but over spatially homogeneous areas even small biases can lead to significant deteriorations relative to the driving reanalysis. As the added value of global climate model (GCM)-driven simulations cannot be smaller than this perfect-boundary estimate, this work demonstrates in a rigorous manner the clear additional value of dynamical downscaling over global climate simulations. The evaluation methodology has a broad spectrum of applicability as it is distribution-free, robust to spatial dependence, and accounts for time series structure.},

abstract = {The transferability of the regional climate model REMO with a standard setup over different regions of the world has been evaluated. The study is based on the idea that the modeling parameters and parameterizations in a regional climate model should be robust to adequately simulate the major climatic characteristic of different regions around the globe. If a model is not able to do that, there might be a chance of an “overtuning” to the “home-region”, which means that the model physics are tuned in a way that it might cover some more fundamental errors, e.g., in the dynamics. All simulations carried out in this study contribute to the joint effort by the international regional downscaling community called COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX). REMO has been integrated over six CORDEX domains forced with the so-called perfect boundary conditions obtained from the global reanalysis dataset ERA-Interim for the period 1989 to 2008. These six domains include Africa, Europe, North America, South America, West Asia and the Mediterranean region. Each of the six simulations was conducted with the identical model setup which allows investigating the transferability of a single model to regions with substantially different climate characteristics. For the consistent evaluation over the different domains, a new evaluation framework is presented by combining the K{\"{o}}ppen-Trewartha climate classification with temperature-precipitation relationship plots and a probability density function (PDF) skill score method. The evaluation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of simulated precipitation and temperature, in comparison to observational datasets, shows that REMO is able to simulate the mean annual climatic features over all the domains quite reasonably, but still some biases remain. The regions over the Amazon and near the coast of major upwelling regions have a significant warm bias. Wet and dry biases appear over the mountainous regions and East Africa, respectively. The temperature over South America and precipitation over the tundra and highland climate of West Asia are misrepresented. The probable causes leading to these biases are discussed and ideas for improvements are suggested. The annual cycle of precipitation and temperature of major catchments in each domain are also well represented by REMO. The model has performed well in simulating the inter- and intra-seasonal characteristics of different climate types in different regions. Moreover, the model has a high ability in representing the general characteristics of different climate types as measured by the probability density function (PDF) skill score method. Although REMO seems to perform best over its home domain in Europe (domain of development and testing), the model has simulated quite well the climate characteristics of other regions with the same set of parameterization options. Therefore, these results lead us to the conclusion that REMO is well suited for long-term climate change simulations to examine projected future changes in all these regions.},

abstract = {Climate models are becoming evermore complex and increasingly relied upon to inform climate change adaptation. Yet progress in model development is lagging behind in many of the regions that need the information most, including in Africa. Targeted model development for Africa is crucial and so too is targeted model evaluation. Assessment of model performance in specific regions often follows a “validation” approach, focusing on mean biases, but if models are to be improved, it is important to understand how they simulate regional climate dynamics: to move from validation to process-based evaluation. This evaluation may be different for every region and requires local weather and climate expertise: a “one size fits all” approach could overlook important, region-specific phenomena. So which are the important processes in African regions? And how might they be evaluated? This paper addresses these questions, drawing on the expertise of a team of scientists from Central, East, southern, and West Africa. For each region, the current understanding of climate models is reviewed, and an example of targeted evaluation is provided, including analysis of moist circulations, teleconnections, and modes of variability. A pan-African perspective is also considered, to examine processes operating between regions. The analysis is based on the Met Office Unified Model, but it uses diagnostics that might be applied to other models. These examples are intended to prompt further discussion among climate modelers and African scientists about how to best evaluate models with an African lens, and promote the development of a model evaluation hub for Africa, to fast track understanding of model behavior for this important continent.},

abstract = {This study evaluates projected changes to rain-on-snow (ROS) characteristics (i.e., frequency, rainfall amount, and runoff) for the future 2041–2070 period with respect to the current 1976–2005 period over North America using six simulations, based on two Canadian RCMs, driven by two driving GCMs for RCP4.5 and 8.5 emission pathways. Prior to assessing projected changes, the two RCMs are evaluated by comparing ERA-Interim driven RCM simulations with available observations, and results indicate that both models reproduce reasonably well the observed spatial patterns of ROS event frequency and other related features. Analysis of current and future simulations suggest general increases in ROS characteristics during the November–March period for most regions of Canada and for northwestern US for the future period, due to an increase in the rainfall frequency with warmer air temperatures in future. Future ROS runoff is often projected to increase more than future ROS rainfall amounts, particularly for northeastern North America, during snowmelt months, as ROS events usually accelerate snowmelt. The simulations show that ROS event is a primary flood generating mechanism over most of Canada and north-western and -central US for the January–May period for the current period and this is projected to continue in the future period. More focused analysis over selected basins shows decreases in future spring runoff due to decreases in both snow cover and ROS runoff. The above results highlight the need to take into consideration ROS events in water resources management adaptation strategies for future climate.},

All 92 models are able to simulate the geographical distribution of the above variables reasonably well. Compared with earlier CMIP5 models, current CMIP6 models have nationally weaker cold biases, a similar nationwide overestimation of precipitation and a weaker underestimation of the southeast$\backslash$3-northwest precipitation gradient, a comparable overestimation of the spatial variability of the interannual variability, and a similar underestimation of the strength of winter monsoon over northern Asia. Pairwise comparison indicates that models have improved from CMIP5 to CMIP6 for climatological temperature and precipitation and winter monsoon but display little improvement for the interannual temperature and precipitation variability and summer monsoon. The ability of models relates to their horizontal resolutions in certain aspects. Both the multi-model arithmetic mean and median display similar skills and outperform most of the individual models in all considered aspects.},

abstract = {Snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays an important role in Asian climate. State-of-the-art models, however, show significant simulation biases. In this study, we assess the main uncertainty associated with model physics in snow cover modeling over the TP using ground-based observations and high-resolution snow cover satellite products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and FengYun-3B (FY3B). We first conducted 10-km simulations using the Noah with multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model by optimizing physics-scheme options, which reduces 8.2{\%} absolute bias of annual snow cover fraction (SCF) compared with the default model settings. Then, five SCF parameterizations in Noah-MP were optimized and assessed, with three of them further reducing the annual SCF biases from around 15{\%} to less than 2{\%}. Thus, optimizing SCF parameterizations appears to be more important than optimizing physics-scheme options in reducing the uncertainty of snow modeling. As a result of improved SCF, the positive bias of simulated surface albedo decreases significantly compared to the GLASS albedo data, particularly in high-elevation regions. This substantially enhances the absorbed solar radiation and further reduces the annual mean biases of ground temperature from −3.5 to −0.8°C and snow depth from 4.2 to 0.2 mm. However, the optimized model still overestimates SCF in the western TP and underestimates SCF in the eastern TP. Further analysis using a higher-resolution (4 km) simulation driven by topographically adjusted air temperature shows slight improvement, suggesting a rather limited contribution of the finer-scale land surface characteristics to SCF uncertainty.},

All RCMs are performed at {\~{}}50 km resolution over the CORDEX-East Asia domain, and are driven by the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) for the period 1989–2008. ERA-Interim sea surface temperature is prescribed as the lower boundary. Performances of the individual RCMs and multi-RCM ensemble mean are investigated in detail for 20-year climatology, intensity, and interannual variability of TC activity compared to observational datasets. Although most of the individual RCMs show significant biases and underestimate TC intensity due to horizontal resolutions still too low to resolve the most intense observed TCs, they reasonably capture the observed climatological spatial distribution and interannual variability of TC activity. The multi-RCM ensemble mean based on the model performance generally outperforms most of the individual models with smaller biases and higher correlation on the spatial and temporal variation of TC activity. This ensemble mean reduces the uncertainty in the simulated TC activity by a single RCM. These analyses suggest that the multi-RCM ensemble within CORDEX-East Asia can be applied to provide more reliable and credible estimation of future TC activity over the western North Pacific due to climate change.},

abstract = {The Aral Sea basin (ASB) is one of the most environmentally vulnerable regions to climate change and human activities. During the past 60 years, irrigation has greatly changed the water distribution and caused severe environmental issues in the ASB. Using remote sensing data, this study investigated the environmental changes induced by irrigation activities in this region. The results show that, in the past decade, land water storage has significantly increased in the irrigated upstream regions (13 km3 year−1) but decreased in the downstream regions (−27 km3 year−1) of the Amu Darya River basin, causing a water storage decrease in the whole basin (−20 km3 year−1). As a result, the water surface area of the Aral Sea has decreased from 32,000 in 2000 to 10,000 km2 in 2015. The shrinking Aral Sea exposed a large portion of the lake bottom to the air, increasing (decreasing) the daytime (nighttime) temperatures by about 1 °C year−1 (0.5 °C year−1). Moreover, there were other potential environmental changes, including drier soil, less vegetation, decreasing cloud and precipitation, and more severe and frequent dust storms. Possible biases in the remote sensing data due to the neglect of the shrinking water surface area of the Aral Sea were identified. These findings highlight the severe environmental threats caused by irrigation in Central Asia and call attention to sustainable water use in such dryland regions.},

Here, we analyse recent atmosphere, surface ocean and sea-ice observations in this region and assess their trends in the context of palaeoclimate records and climate model simulations. Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability overwhelms the forced response in the observations, but the models may not fully represent this natural variability or may overestimate the magnitude of the forced response.},

abstract = {In this paper we report on the development of a new homogeneous dataset for Pacific Island station temperatures, and the variability and change that these data show. We have worked closely with meteorological services in the Pacific and East Timor to collate and rehabilitate historical climate records, incorporating homogeneity assessment and adjustment where appropriate to produce reliable analyses of temperature trends. Overall, these homogeneity adjustments create no systematic bias compared to the raw data since the early 1960s, but improve both spatial and temporal consistency at the individual station level for both variability and trends. The updated homogeneous records indicate that mean temperatures have increased at all available Pacific island stations over 1961-2010, with rates ranging from +0.04 to +0.33 °C/decade, across the network as a whole. The strongest warming trends are found in Papua New Guinea and French Polynesia, while none of the homogeneous station records show cooling over the past 70, 50 or 30 years. Trends in maximum and minimum temperatures are very similar to those of mean temperature at most stations, apart from in Fiji, Tonga and Niue where there is a tendency for greater warming for maximum temperatures. The amount of warming in the wet and dry seasons is also similar at most stations, although stations in Fiji, Tonga and Niue display more warming during the wet season. A simple regional mean of Pacific island series shows a trend of +0.16 °C/decade over 1961-2010 and indicates that 2010 was the warmest year on record averaged across the stations available at time of analysis. This regional mean station series compares well with a regional mean series extracted from a global gridded dataset for the last 50 years. Overall, the warming in Pacific Island temperature records over the past half-century is consistent with that expected from humaninduced global warming and is large relative to natural interannual variability associated with factors such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation.},

abstract = {Temperature trends across Antarctica over the last few decades reveal strong and statistically significant warming in West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) contrasting with no significant change overall in East Antarctica. However, recent studies have documented cooling in the AP since the late 1990s. This study aims to place temperature changes in the AP and West Antarctica into a larger spatial and temporal perspective by analyzing monthly station-based surface temperature observations since 1957 across the extratropical Southern Hemisphere, along with sea surface temperature (SST) data and mean sea level pressure reanalysis data. The results confirm statistically significant cooling in station observations and SST trends throughout the AP region since 1999. However, the full 60-yr period shows statistically significant, widespread warming across most of the Southern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. Positive SST trends broadly reflect these warming trends, especially in the midlatitudes. After confirming the importance of the southern annular mode (SAM) on southern high-latitude climate variability, the influence is removed from the station temperature records, revealing statistically significant background warming across all of the extratropical Southern Hemisphere. Antarctic temperature trends in a suite of climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are then investigated. Consistent with previous work the CMIP5 models warm Antarctica at the background temperature rate that is 2 times faster than that observed. However, removing the SAM influence from both CMIP5 and observed temperatures results in Antarctic trends that differ only modestly, perhaps due to natural multidecadal variability remaining in the observations.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: We investigated the performance of RegCM4 in simulating rainfall over Southeast Asia with different combinations of deep-convection and air-sea flux parameterization schemes. Four different gridded rainfall datasets were used for the model assessment. In general, the simulations produced dry biases over the equatorial region and slightly wet biases over mainland Indo-China, except those experiments with the MIT Emanuel cumulus schemes, in which large positive rainfall biases were simulated. However, simulations with the MIT schemes were generally better at reproducing annual rainfall variations. The simulations were not sensitive to the treatment of air-sea fluxes. While the simulations generally produced the rainfall climatology well, all simulations showed stronger inter-annual variability compared to observations. Nevertheless, the time evolution of the inter-annual variations was well reproduced, particularly over the eastern Maritime Continent. Over mainland Southeast Asia, all simulations produced unrealistic rainfall anomaly responses to surface temperature. The lack of summer air-sea interactions in the model resulted in enhanced oceanic forcing over the regions, leading to positive rainfall anomalies during years with warm ocean temperature anomalies. This shortcoming in turn caused much stronger atmospheric forcing on the land surface processes compared to that of the observation. A robust score-ranking system was designed to rank the simulations according to their performance in reproducing different aspects of rainfall characteristics. The results suggest that the simulation with the MIT Emanuel convective scheme and the BATS1e air-sea flux scheme performs better overall compared to the rest of the simulations.},

Ten observed, reanalysed and model-simulated climate data sets were explored for changes in surface air temperature, rainfall, air pressure, winds, ocean currents and sea surface height. The analysis of spatial and temporal climate trends from historical observations provided a context to assess two coupled model simulations (IPSL, MIROC) based on the A1B emission scenario. Temperatures in the satellite era exhibited upward trends greater than +0.4 °C/year in the MIROC and IPSL A1B model simulations; between +0.02 °C/year and +0.03 °C/year in NCDC, HADCRU, CFS-R and NCEPe data sets; +0.01 °C/year in NCEPr and GHCN observations; and +0.002 °C/year in the ECMWF data set. Although rainfall trends in the satellite era were minimal in many data sets because of drought in the early 1980s, there was a significant downtrend in the IPSL simulation of -0.013 mm/day per year. When averaging the longer data sets together over the 20th century, the southern African rainfall trend was -0.003 mm/day per year. Other key features of the analyses include a poleward drift of the sub-tropical anticyclones and a +1.5 mm/year rise in sea surface height along the coast.},

All the RCMs regionalized information from the same general circulation model (GCM), applying the IPCC-SRES A2 radiative forcing scenario. In addition, some simulations used SRES B2 radiative forcing and/or boundary conditions provided by an alternative GCM. Ice cover over the Baltic Sea was examined using a statistical model that related the annual maximum extent of ice to wintertime coastal temperatures. Fewer days with frost and snow, shorter frost seasons, a smaller liquid water equivalent of snow, and milder sea ice conditions were produced by all model simulations, irrespective of the forcing scenario and the driving GCM. The projected changes have implications across a diverse range of human activities. Details of the projections were subject to differences in RCM design, deviations between the boundary conditions of the driving GCMs, uncertainties in future emissions and random effects due to internal climate variability. A larger number of GCMs as drivers of the RCMs would most likely have resulted in somewhat wider ranges in the frost, snow and sea ice estimates than those presented in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract While the Hawaiian Islands are experiencing long-term warming, spatial and temporal patterns are poorly characterized. Drawing on daily temperature records from 309 stations (1905–2017), we explored relationships of surface air temperatures (Tmax, Tmin, Tavg, and diurnal temperature range) to atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface variables. Statistical modeling of spatial patterns (2006–2017) highlighted the strong negative influence of elevation and moisture on air temperature and the effects of distance inland, cloud frequency, wind speed, and the local trade wind inversion on the elevation dependence of surface air temperature. We developed time series of sea level air temperature and surface lapse rate by modeling surface air temperature as a simple function of elevation and found a strong long-term (1905–2017) warming trend in sea level Tmin, twice that of Tmax (+0.17 vs +0.07°C/decade), suggesting regional warming, possibly enhanced by urbanization and cloud cover effects. Removing this trend, sea level Tmax and Tmin tracked SST and rainfall at decadal time scales, while Tmax increased with periods of weakened trade winds. Sea level air temperatures correlated with North Pacific climate indices, reflecting the influence of regional circulation via SST, rain, clouds, and trade winds that modulate environmental warming across the Hawaiian Islands. Increasing (steeper) Tmax surface lapse rates for the 0- to 1,600-m elevation range (into the cloud zone) over 1978–2017 coincide with observations of marine boundary layer drying and rising cloud base heights, suggesting a need to better understand elevation-dependent warming in this tropical/subtropical maritime environment and associated changes to cloud formation and persistence.},

abstract = {Regional reanalyses constitute valuable new data sources for climatological applications by providing consistent meteorological parameter fields commonly requested, e.g., wind speed, solar radiation, temperature and precipitation. Within the European project Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional ReAnalyses (UERRA) three different numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been employed to generate different European regional reanalyses and subsequent surface reanalysis products. The uncertainties of the individual reanalysis products and of the combined UERRA multi-model ensemble are investigated by comparing against observations. Here, we provide guidance on the meteorological parameters and spatial-temporal scales where regional reanalyses add value to global reanalyses. The reanalysis fields are compared to station measurements and derived gridded fields, as well as satellite data. In general, reanalyses are especially valuable in data sparse areas, where the NWP models are superior in transporting information compared to the traditional gridding procedures based on station observations. For wind speed at heights relevant for wind energy, where little conventional observations exist, regional reanalyses can provide higher resolution horizontally, vertically, and in time, adding value to global reanalyses. Solar radiation fields capture the variability in general, however, they are prone to model-dependent biases. Temperature fields were generally found to be in good agreement with station observations, with biases for the (moderately) extreme values causing potential pitfalls for threshold applications such as climate indices. Comparisons of the precipitation fields in different areas of Europe demonstrate that various reanalyses excel in different regions. The multi-model ensemble of regional reanalyses was found to provide better uncertainty estimates than an ensemble realisation from one reanalysis system alone. The freely available regional reanalyses provide a new, high resolution data source, which might be attractive for many applications, especially when conventional data are sparse or restricted by data policies.},

abstract = {The interannual precipitation variability over Western Himalaya–Karakoram–Hindukush (WHKH) region has a significant impact on the freshwater resources, energy and agriculture sectors. Midlatitude storms play the role of an atmospheric bridge between large-scale circulation patterns and regional precipitation distributions during the winter (December–April) season. In this study, we investigated long-term changes between El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and storm activity as well as between ENSO and for precipitation, over WHKH for the period 1950–2015. The Melbourne University Objective Cyclone Identification and Tracking Scheme is used to track the midlatitude storms. A non-linear relationship is identified between the storm track frequency and precipitation over the WHKH region. The correlation between the storm frequency and precipitation increases significantly (95{\%}) after the 1980s and reaches a maximum value of 0.53. Furthermore, 21-year running correlations also show non-linear relationships between ENSO and WHKH's precipitation as well as for storm tracks frequency. The simultaneous correlation between storm tracks frequency (precipitation) and Ni{\~{n}}o3.4 index was insignificant 0.03 (0.25) in the earlier period from 1950 to 1979, which surged to 0.47 (0.60) in recent 30-years period from 1986 to 2015. Composites and regression analysis illustrate that ENSO modulated the midlatitude storm tracks over the WHKH region, which in turns impact more precipitation anomalies in the recent 30-years period. Moreover, Saudi King Abdulaziz University Atmospheric General Circulation Model (Saudi-KAU AGCM) also confirms the change in the relationship between ENSO and WHKH precipitation variability during the winter season between the two periods. These findings may have important implications for the seasonal rainfall predictability of the WHKH region.},

abstract = {Multidecadal variations in the relationship between El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Arabian Peninsula rainfall are investigated using observed data for the last 60 years and various atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments. The wet season in the Arabian Peninsula from November to April was considered. The 6-month averaged Arabian rainfall was negatively correlated with ENSO for an earlier 30-yr period from 1950 to 1979 and positively correlated to ENSO for a more recent period from 1981 to 2010. The multidecadal variations can be attributed to the variations in Indian Ocean SST anomalies accompanied by ENSO. In the early 30-yr period, ENSO accompanied relatively large SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean, whereas in the recent 30-yr period it accompanied relatively small SST anomalies in the Indian Ocean. The atmospheric anomalies in the Arabian region during ENSO are combined responses to the Pacific and Indian Ocean SST anomalies, which offset each other during ENSO. The recent El Ni{\~{n}}o events accompanied negative 200-hPa geopotential height (GH) anomalies over the Arabian region, mainly forced by the Pacific SST anomalies, resulting in an increase of precipitation over the region. In contrast, in the early 30-yr period, Indian Ocean SST anomalies played a dominant role in the atmospheric responses over the Arabian region during ENSO, and the negative GH anomalies and more precipitation over the Arabian region were mainly forced by the negative SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean, which appeared during La Ni{\~{n}}a. These observed findings are confirmed by various AGCM experiments.},

The JJA season exhibited the highest mean temperature, whilst DJF displayed the lowest mean temperature in the whole study period. The JJA monthly empirical cumulative distribution frequency (ECDF) range (26 to 28 °C) was less than that of DJF (7 to 10 °C) since JJA matched closely to CRU. The JJA and DJF seasons are warming, with higher warming trends in winters than in summers. On temporal scale, models performed better in JJA with overall low bias, low RMSE (root mean square error), and higher positive CC (correlation coefficient) values. DJF performance was undermined with higher bias and RMSE with weak positive correlation estimates. Overall, CanESM5, CESM2, CESM2-WACCM, GFDL-CM4, HadGEM-GC31-LL, MPI-ESM1-2-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, and MRI-ESM-0 performed better for JJA and DJF.},

This study presents results from two ground-based radar surveys conducted in Greenland in 2007 and 2015, respectively. The first survey was conducted during the traverse from the ice-core station NGRIP (North Greenland Ice Core Project) to the ice-core station NEEM (North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling). The second survey was carried out during the traverse from NEEM to the ice-core station EGRIP (East Greenland Ice Core Project) and then onwards to Summit Station. The total length of the radar profiles is 1427 km. From the radar data, we retrieve the large-scale spatial variation of the accumulation rates in the interior of the ice sheet. The accumulation rates range from 0.11 to 0.26 m a −1 ice equivalent with the lowest values found in the northeastern sector towards EGRIP. We find no evidence of temporal or spatial changes in accumulation rates when comparing the 150-year average accumulation rates with the 321-year average accumulation rates. Comparisons with regional climate models reveal that the models underestimate accumulation rates by up to 35{\%} in northeastern Greenland. Our results serve as a robust baseline to detect present changes in either surface accumulation rates or patterns.},

abstract = {The South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) is a continental scale weather phenomenon, which fluctuates at a range of temporal and spatial scales. Although majority of global climate models are broadly able to simulate the large scale characteristics of the SASM, they generally have major deficiencies such as constraints in reproducing observed mean precipitation. It is generally anticipated that higher resolution regional climate models (RCMs) would be able to simulate an improved mean state owing to their capacity to better simulate fine temporal and spatial scale features and variability. Here, we analyse SASM simulations using a contemporary Hadley Centre RCM, forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis and observed sea surface temperature, at medium (0.44°) and high (0.11°) horizontal resolutions. Evaluation of the results show that, compared to the medium resolution RCM, the high resolution RCM is able to better resolve the interaction of the low level monsoon flow with the Himalayan orography leading to added value in simulating many aspects of SASM precipitation such as the seasonal mean, relative frequency distribution of daily precipitation, and various metrics of precipitation extremes. In contrast to many previous studies, maximum added value is note along the Indo-Gangetic plain rather than over the complex Himalayas, and the added values of up to 5 mm day−1 and 50 days are noted for mean precipitation and number of wet days, respectively over the region. Similarly, added values of up to 15 and 3 mm day−1 are noted for 95th percentile of daily precipitation and simple daily intensity index, respectively over central India and the Himalayan range. These results suggest that higher resolution RCMs have the potential to add more value when downscaling global climate model climate change projections. {\textcopyright} 2016 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = { AbstractTwo ensembles of dynamically downscaled climate simulations for North America—the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) featuring simulations for North America (NA-CORDEX)—are analyzed to assess the impact of using a small set of global general circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs) on representing uncertainty in regional projections. Selecting GCMs for downscaling based on their equilibrium climate sensitivities is a reasonable strategy, but there are regions where the uncertainty is not fully captured. For instance, the six NA-CORDEX GCMs fail to span the full ranges produced by models in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) in summer temperature projections in the western and winter precipitation projections in the eastern United States. Similarly, the four NARCCAP GCMs are overall poor at spanning the full CMIP3 ranges in seasonal temperatures. For the Southeast, the NA-CORDEX GCMs capture the uncertainty in summer but not in winter projections, highlighting one consequence of downscaling a subset of GCMs. Ranges produced by the RCMs are often wider than their driving GCMs but are sensitive to the experimental design. For example, the downscaled projections of summer precipitation are of opposite polarity in two RCM ensembles in some regions. Additionally, the ability of the RCMs to simulate observed temperature trends is affected by the internal variability characteristics of both the RCMs and driving GCMs, and is not systematically related to their historical performance. This has implications for adequately sampling the impact of internal variability on regional trends and for using model performance to identify credible projections. These findings suggest that a multimodel perspective on uncertainties in regional projections is integral to the interpretation of RCM results. },

abstract = {Abstract. In the current work we present six hindcast WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model) simulations for the EURO-CORDEX (European Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment) domain with different configurations in microphysics, convection and radiation for the time period 1990–2008. All regional model simulations are forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis and have the same spatial resolution (0.44°). These simulations are evaluated for surface temperature, precipitation, short- and longwave downward radiation at the surface and total cloud cover. The analysis of the WRF ensemble indicates systematic temperature and precipitation biases, which are linked to different physical mechanisms in the summer and winter seasons. Overestimation of total cloud cover and underestimation of downward shortwave radiation at the surface, mostly linked to the Grell–Devenyi convection and CAM (Community Atmosphere Model) radiation schemes, intensifies the negative bias in summer temperatures over northern Europe (max −2.5 °C). Conversely, a strong positive bias in downward shortwave radiation in summer over central (40–60{\%}) and southern Europe mitigates the systematic cold bias over these regions, signifying a typical case of error compensation. Maximum winter cold biases are over northeastern Europe (−2.8 °C); this location suggests that land–atmosphere rather than cloud–radiation interactions are to blame. Precipitation is overestimated in summer by all model configurations, especially the higher quantiles which are associated with summertime deep cumulus convection. The largest precipitation biases are produced by the Kain–Fritsch convection scheme over the Mediterranean. Precipitation biases in winter are lower than those for summer in all model configurations (15–30{\%}). The results of this study indicate the importance of evaluating not only the basic climatic parameters of interest for climate change applications (temperature and precipitation), but also other components of the energy and water cycle, in order to identify the sources of systematic biases, possible compensatory or masking mechanisms and suggest pathways for model improvement.},

abstract = {The roles of anthropogenic climate change and internal climate variability in causing the Mediterranean region's late 20th Century extended winter drying trend are examined using 19 coupled models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. The observed drying was influenced by the robust positive trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) from the 1960s to the 1990s. Model simulations and observations are used to assess the probable relative roles of radiative forcing, and internal variability in explaining the circulation trend that drove much of the precipitation change. Using the multi-model ensemble we assess how well the models can produce multidecadal trends of realistic magnitude, and apply signal-to-noise maximizing EOF analysis to obtain a best estimate of the models' (mean) sea-level pressure (SLP) and precipitation responses to changes in radiative forcing. The observed SLP and Mediterranean precipitation fields are regressed onto the timeseries associated with the models' externally forced pattern and the implied linear trends in both fields between 1960 and 1999 are calculated. It is concluded that the radiatively forced trends are a small fraction of the total observed trends. Instead it is argued that the robust trends in the observed NAO and Mediterranean rainfall during this period were largely due to multidecadal internal variability with a small contribution from the external forcing. Differences between the observed and NAO-associated precipitation trends are consistent with those expected as a response to radiative forcing. The radiatively forced trends in circulation and precipitation are expected to strengthen in the current century and this study highlights the importance of their contribution to future precipitation changes in the region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries of the world to temperature extremes due to its predominant arid climate and geographic location in the fast temperature rising zone. Spatial distribution of the trends in annual and seasonal temperatures and temperature extremes over Pakistan has been assessed in this study. The gauge-based gridded daily temperature data of Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) having a spatial resolution of 1° × 1° was used for the assessment of trends over the period 1960–2013 using modified Mann-Kendall test (MMK), which can discriminate the multi-decadal oscillatory variations from secular trends. The results show an increase in the annual average of daily maximum and minimum temperatures in 92 and 99{\%} area of Pakistan respectively at 95{\%} level of confidence. The annual temperature is increasing faster in southern high-temperature region compared to other parts of the country. The minimum temperature is rising faster (0.17–0.37 °C/decade) compared to maximum temperature (0.17–0.29 °C/decade) and therefore declination of diurnal temperature range (DTR) (− 0.15 to − 0.08 °C/decade) in some regions. The annual numbers of both hot and cold days are increasing in whole Pakistan except in the northern sub-Himalayan region. Heat waves are on the rise, especially in the hot Sindh plains and the Southern coastal region, while the cold waves are becoming lesser in the northern cold region. Obtained results contradict with the findings of previous studies on temperature trends, which indicate the need for reassessment of climatic trends in Pakistan using the MMK test to understand the anthropogenic impacts of climate change.},

abstract = {Natural variability of climate considerably affects hydro-climatic trend significance, and therefore, removal of such influence is essential to understand the unidirectional trends due to global warming. The objective of this study was to evaluate the trends in precipitation extremes in the arid province of Pakistan by removing the natural variability of climate to understand the effect of global warming on precipitation extremes during two major cropping seasons, Rabi and Kharif. Daily precipitation data of APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation—Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation) for the period 1951–2015 was used for this purpose. An improved form of classical Mann-Kendall (MK) test known as modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) was used which can estimate trends by discarding the influence of natural cycles present in time series. The results were compared with the classical MK test to show the novelty in the findings of this investigation. The results revealed a large influence of climate fluctuations on the trends in all the extreme precipitation indices for both seasons. The reduction in trend significance was noticed between 25 and 100{\%} for different precipitation indices when MMK instead of MK test was used. The reduction was observed more for the positive trends in the indices compared with negative trends. The results revealed that global warming caused an increase in total annual precipitation at a rate of 2.8–34.8 mm/decade during 1951–2015. Besides, the annual number of extreme precipitation days was found to increase in the north by 0.1–0.84 days/decade and the number of annual precipitation days to decrease in the west for all seasons up to − 8.6 days/decade. An increase in continuous precipitation days was detected by 0.6–1.0 day/decade in the northeast while a decrease by − 0.5 to − 1.0 days/decade in the southwest and northwest. The continuous dry days decreased in the north and the central regions by up to − 6.3 days/decade while a rise in 1-day maximum precipitation by 6.6–35 mm/decade in the central north. Analysis of results revealed that the overestimation of trends by classical MK test is more in the arid region of Pakistan compared with other regions.},

The estimation of contributions from such climate-forming factors as radiation and circulation is performed for the same intervals. It is revealed that an increase in the annual mean ground–air temperature in the investigated region of Western Siberia was still taking place in the period of 1985–2014; however, the warming process was less active than in the 1976–2005 period. Winter months play the largest role in decreasing the temperature growth rate; during these months, the warming process was replaced by a cooling one in the second time interval. It is shown that the circulation factors, that is, the mechanisms described by indices of global circulation, played the dominant role in the period from 1985 to 2014.},

The simulated precipitation shows that climatic heavy rainfall centers are well captured in the seasonal march. In near and far future, the projected rainfall by NHRCM using outputs of the Meteorological Research Institute atmospheric general circulation model 3.2 with RCP8.5 scenario will clearly decrease in Northwest and Central Vietnam in June–August, while it will remarkably increase in Northeast and Central Vietnam in September–November. The model underestimates TC number and activity area in the first half of the TC season but slightly overestimates in the second half as compared to the best track. Projected TCs indicate a decrease in both TC number and activity area in near and far future. Moreover, the maximum TC number occurs one month late as compared to the present climate, whereas TC number remarkably decreases in July–August in far future. Rainfall induced by TCs increases in North Vietnam in the projected climate as compared to the baseline period. It also increases in mid-Central Vietnam in near future but decreases in southern Central Vietnam in near and far future. Conversely, non-TC rainfall is likely to decrease in North Vietnam in future and in mid-Central Vietnam in near future but increase in southern Central Vietnam in far future.},

abstract = {In this study, a comparison in the precipitation extremes as exhibited by the seven reference datasets is made to ascertain whether the inferences based on these datasets agree or they differ. These seven datasets, roughly grouped in three categories i.e. rain-gauge based (APHRODITE, CPC-UNI), satellite-based (TRMM, GPCP1DD) and reanalysis based (ERA-Interim, MERRA, and JRA55), having a common data period 1998–2007 are considered. Focus is to examine precipitation extremes in the summer monsoon rainfall over South Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Measures of extreme precipitation include the percentile thresholds, frequency of extreme precipitation events and other quantities. Results reveal that the differences in displaying extremes among the datasets are small over South Asia and East Asia but large differences among the datasets are displayed over the Southeast Asian region including the maritime continent. Furthermore, precipitation data appear to be more consistent over East Asia among the seven datasets. Decadal trends in extreme precipitation are consistent with known results over South and East Asia. No trends in extreme precipitation events are exhibited over Southeast Asia. Outputs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulation data are categorized as high, medium and low-resolution models. The regions displaying maximum intensity of extreme precipitation appear to be dependent on model resolution. High-resolution models simulate maximum intensity of extreme precipitation over the Indian sub-continent, medium-resolution models over northeast India and South China and the low-resolution models over Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand. In summary, there are differences in displaying extreme precipitation statistics among the seven datasets considered here and among the 29 CMIP5 model data outputs.},

This study analyzes temperature data from regional climate models (RCMs) participating in the CORDEX - East Asia region, accounting for the spatial dependence structure of the data. In particular, we assess similarities and dissimilarities of the outputs from two RCMs, HadGEM3-RA and RegCM4, over the region and over time. A Bayesian functional analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach is used to simultaneously model the temperature patterns from the two RCMs for the current and future climate. We exploit nonstationary spatial models to handle the spatial dependence structure of the temperature variable, which depends heavily on latitude and altitude. For a seasonal comparison, we examine changes in the winter temperature in addition to the summer temperature data. We find that the temperature increase projected by RegCM4 tends to be smaller than the projection of HadGEM3-RA for summers, and that the future warming projected by HadGEM3-RA tends to be weaker for winters. Also, the results show that there will be a warming of 1-3°C over the region in 45 years. More specifically, the warming pattern clearly depends on the latitude, with greater temperature increases in higher latitude areas, which implies that warming may be more severe in the northern part of the domain.},

abstract = {This study analyzed decadal variability in the near-surface air temperature and precipitation and key climatological elements in South Korea from 1960 to 2010. The decadal trend toward increases in annual temperature was conspicuous in large cities at a rate of 0.29 ± 0.08 °C decade−1 compared with 0.11 ± 0.08 °C decade−1 in other stations. The increasing rate in January temperatures has resulted in a rise in annual temperature. The 1990s marked an all-time high in decadal January temperatures, which caused a shift of −3 °C in the northern boundary of the subtropical climate zone, compared with the 1960s–1980s. The shift of −3 °C isotherm to the north occurred in the inland and on the western parts of South Korea in the 1990s. The increasing trend of air temperature in Korea is associated with the general increase in greenhouse gases in East Asia. The decadal precipitation trend has caused a large increase in summer precipitation at a rate of 40.6 ± 4.3 mm decade−1, resulting in an increase of annual precipitation of 27.7 ± 5.5 mm decade−1. The spatial variability of the overlapping 30-year precipitation grew due to increases in precipitation on the southern and eastern parts of South Korea from 1981 to 2010. The northward shift of the subtropical zone has resulted in a rise of heavy rainfall days (≥30 mm day−1) from 1981 to 2010.},

abstract = {This study investigates the performance of simulated precipitation and estimates future changes in precipitation in CORDEX-East Asia Phase I. In the Historical experiment (1981–2005), a global climate model used as a lateral boundary condition does not realistically simulate the timing and intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon. Hence, it overestimates precipitation over East Asia. Generally, the results of the regional climate models also show similar bias characteristics to that of the large-scale forcing data. The individual biases of the regional climate model vary according to a model configuration, such as physical parameterization schemes. However, when bias correction is applied to data, the spatial variability and spatial correlation of the long-term mean precipitation become similar to the observations, and the annual cycle of precipitation is much improved. The two future experiments in the mid-twenty-first century period (2025–2049), show that mean and extreme precipitation amounts increase over the Korean Peninsula and northern China compared to the frequency of wet days. The increment of the low-level water vapor in all seasons can be attributed to the increased precipitation amounts; moreover, the East Asian summer monsoon is enhanced in mid-latitudes and lasts longer in summer owing to the strengthened western North Pacific Subtropical High. The increasing southerly wind from the East Asian summer monsoon over eastern China and the Korean Peninsula results in favorable conditions for the increase in precipitation.},

F{\"{o}}hn conditions occurred for over 20{\%} of the time during this period and are associated with increased air temperatures and decreased relative humidity (relative to nonf{\"{o}}hn conditions) over the western part of the ice shelf. During f{\"{o}}hn conditions, the downward turbulent flux of sensible heat and the downwelling shortwave radiation both increase. However, in AMPS, these warming tendencies are largely balanced by an increase in upward latent heat flux and a decrease in downwelling longwave radiation so the impact of f{\"{o}}hn on the modeled net SEB is small. This balance is highly sensitive to the representation of surface energy fluxes in the model, and limited validation data suggest that AMPS may underestimate the sensitivity of SEB and melt to f{\"{o}}hn. There is broad agreement on the spatial pattern of melt between the model and satellite observations but disagreement in the frequency with which melt occurs. Satellite observations indicate localized regions of persistent melt along the foot of the Antarctic Peninsula mountains which are not simulated by the model.

The models' ability to reproduce the space-time variability of annual, seasonal, and interannual rainfall has been diagnosed. A series of metrics have been employed to quantify the RCM-simulated rainfall pattern discrepancies and biases compared to three gridded observational datasets. It is found that most models underestimate the annual rainfall over the country; however, the seasonality of rainfall is properly reproduced by the RCMs with a bimodal component over the major part of the country and a unimodal component over the north. Models reproduce the interannual variability of the dry season (December–February) but fail with the long and short rains seasons even if the ENSO and IOD signal is correctly simulated by most models. In many aspects, the UQAM-CRCM5 RCM is found to perform best over the region. Overall, the ensemble mean of the ten RCMs reproduces the rainfall climatology over Uganda with reasonable skill.},

The SMB over grounded ice is projected to increase as a response to stronger snowfall, only partly offset by enhanced meltwater run-off. This leads to a cumulated sea-level-rise mitigation (i.e. an increase in surface mass) of the grounded Antarctic surface by 5.1 ± 1.9 cm sea level equivalent (SLE) in CMIP5-RCP8.5 (Relative Concentration Pathway 8.5) and 6.3 ± 2.0 cm SLE in CMIP6-ssp585 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 585). Additionally, the CMIP6 low-emission ssp126 and intermediate-emission ssp245 scenarios project a stabilized surface mass gain, resulting in a lower mitigation to sea level rise than in ssp585. Over the ice shelves, the strong run-off increase associated with higher temperature is projected to decrease the SMB (more strongly in CMIP6-ssp585 compared to CMIP5-RCP8.5). Ice shelves are however predicted to have a close-to-present-equilibrium stable SMB under CMIP6 ssp126 and ssp245 scenarios. Future uncertainties are mainly due to the sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing and the timing of the projected warming. While ice shelves should remain at a close-to-equilibrium stable SMB under the Paris Agreement, MAR projects strong SMB decrease for an Antarctic near-surface warming above +2.5 ∘C compared to 1981–2010 mean temperature, limiting the warming range before potential irreversible damages on the ice shelves. Finally, our results reveal the existence of a potential threshold (+7.5 ∘C) that leads to a lower grounded-SMB increase. This however has to be confirmed in following studies using more extreme or longer future scenarios.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. We investigate European regional climate change for time periods when the global mean temperature has increased by 1.5 and 2 °C compared to pre-industrial conditions. Results are based on regional downscaling of transient climate change simulations for the 21st century with global climate models (GCMs) from the fifth-phase Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We use an ensemble of EURO-CORDEX high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) simulations undertaken at a computational grid of 12.5 km horizontal resolution covering Europe. The ensemble consists of a range of RCMs that have been used for downscaling different GCMs under the RCP8.5 forcing scenario. The results indicate considerable near-surface warming already at the lower 1.5 °C of warming. Regional warming exceeds that of the global mean in most parts of Europe, being the strongest in the northernmost parts of Europe in winter and in the southernmost parts of Europe together with parts of Scandinavia in summer. Changes in precipitation, which are less robust than the ones in temperature, include increases in the north and decreases in the south with a borderline that migrates from a northerly position in summer to a southerly one in winter. Some of these changes are already seen at 1.5 °C of warming but are larger and more robust at 2 °C. Changes in near-surface wind speed are associated with a large spread among individual ensemble members at both warming levels. Relatively large areas over the North Atlantic and some parts of the continent show decreasing wind speed while some ocean areas in the far north show increasing wind speed. The changes in temperature, precipitation and wind speed are shown to be modified by changes in mean sea level pressure, indicating a strong relationship with the large-scale circulation and its internal variability on decade-long timescales. By comparing to a larger ensemble of CMIP5 GCMs we find that the RCMs can alter the results, leading either to attenuation or amplification of the climate change signal in the underlying GCMs. We find that the RCMs tend to produce less warming and more precipitation (or less drying) in many areas in both winter and summer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We analyze and intercompare the performance of a set of ten regional climate models (RCMs) along with the ensemble mean of their statistics in simulating daily precipitation characteristics during the West African monsoon (WAM) period (June–July–August–September). The experiments are conducted within the framework of the COordinated Regional Downscaling Experiments for the African domain. We find that the RCMs exhibit substantial differences that are associated with a wide range of estimates of higher-order statistics, such as intensity, frequency, and daily extremes mostly driven by the convective scheme employed. For instance, a number of the RCMs simulate a similar number of wet days compared to observations but greater rainfall intensity, especially in oceanic regions adjacent to the Guinea Highlands because of a larger number of heavy precipitation events. Other models exhibit a higher wet-day frequency but much lower rainfall intensity over West Africa due to the occurrence of less frequent heavy rainfall events. This indicates the existence of large uncertainties related to the simulation of daily rainfall characteristics by the RCMs. The ensemble mean of the indices substantially improves the RCMs' simulated frequency and intensity of precipitation events, moderately outperforms that of the 95th percentile, and provides mixed benefits for the dry and wet spells. Although the ensemble mean improved results cannot be generalized, such an approach produces encouraging results and can help, to some extent, to improve the robustness of the response of the WAM daily precipitation to the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming.},

abstract = {Monthly precipitation data from the Global Historical Climatology Network for 42 stations in Morocco and its vicinity are investigated with respect to baroclinicity, storm track and cyclone activity, moisture transports, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variations, and different circulation types by means of correlation and composite studies. The results are related to a climate change scenario from an ECHAM4/OPYC3 transient greenhouse gas only (GHG) simulation. Precipitation in northwestern Morocco shows a clear link to the baroclinic activity over the North Atlantic during boreal winter (DJF). In large precipitation months the North Atlantic storm track is shifted southward, more westerly and northwesterly circulation situations occur and moisture transports from the Atlantic are enhanced. The occurrence of local cyclones and upper-level troughs is more frequent than in low precipitation months. The negative correlation to the NAO is relatively strong, especially with Gibraltar as a southern pole ( - 0.71). The northward shift of the storm track and eastward shift of the Azores High predicted by the ECHAM model for increasing GHG concentrations would therefore be associated with decreasing precipitation and potentially serious impacts for the future water supply for parts of Morocco. In the region south of the Atlas mountains, moisture transports from the Atlantic along the southern flank of the Atlas Mountains associated with cyclones west of Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula can be identified as a decisive factor for precipitation. Northeastern Morocco and Northwestern Algeria, however, is rather dominated by the influence of cyclones over the Western Mediterranean that are associated with a strong northwesterly moisture transport. As both regions appear to be less dependent on the North Atlantic storm track and more on local processes, a straight forward interpretation of the large-scale changes predicted by the ECHAM4/OPYC3 cannot be done without the application of down-scaling methods in the future.},

Despite widespread warming, historical trends in snowfall and snow depth are generally mixed owing to competing influences of trends in precipitation. Trends toward later snow-cover onset in the western half of the conterminous United States and earlier onset in the eastern half and a widespread trend toward earlier final meltoff of snow cover combined to produce trends toward shorter snow seasons in the eastern half of the United States and in the west and longer snow seasons in the Great Plains and southern Rockies. The annual total number of days with snow cover exhibited a widespread decline. Monthly trend patterns show the dominant influence of temperature trends on occurrence of snow cover in the warmer snow-season months and a combination of temperature and precipitation trends in the colder months. A canonical correlation analysis indicated that most trends presented here took hold in the 1970s, consistent with the temporal pattern of global warming during the study period.},

abstract = {An assessment was made of whether detectable changes in tropical cyclone (TC) activity are identifiable in observations and whether any changes can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Overall, historical data suggest detectable TC activity changes in some regions associated with TC track changes, while data quality and quantity issues create greater challenges for analyses based on TC intensity and frequency. A number of specific published conclusions (case studies) about possible detectable anthropogenic influence on TCs were assessed using the conventional approach of preferentially avoiding type I errors (i.e., overstating anthropogenic influence or detection). We conclude there is at least low to medium confidence that the observed poleward migration of the latitude of maximum intensity in the western North Pacific is detectable, or highly unusual compared to expected natural variability. Opinion on the author team was divided on whether any observed TC changes demonstrate discernible anthropogenic influence, or whether any other observed changes represent detectable changes. The issue was then reframed by assessing evidence for detectable anthropogenic influence while seeking to reduce the chance of type II errors (i.e., missing or understating anthropogenic influence or detection). For this purpose, we used a much weaker “balance of evidence” criterion for assessment. This leads to a number of more speculative TC detection and/or attribution statements, which we recognize have substantial potential for being false alarms (i.e., overstating anthropogenic influence or detection) but which may be useful for risk assessment. Several examples of these alternative statements, derived using this approach, are presented in the report.},

The CMIP5 historical all-forcing runs are broadly consistent with the observed trend pattern (1901–2010), but with an apparent low trend bias tendency in the simulations. Despite this bias, observed and modeled trends are statistically consistent over 59{\%} of the analyzed area. Over 20{\%} (9{\%}) of the analyzed area, increased (decreased) precipitation is partly attributable to anthropogenic forcing. These inferred human-induced changes include increases over regions of the north-central United States, southern Canada, Europe, and southern South America and decreases over parts of the Mediterranean region and northern tropical Africa. Trends for the shorter periods (1951–2010 and 1981–2010) do not indicate a prominent low trend bias in the models, as found for the 1901–2010 trends. An atmosphere-only model, forced with observed sea surface temperatures and other climate forcing agents, also underpredicts the observed precipitation increase in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics since 1901. The CMIP5 all-forcing ensemble's low bias in simulated trends since 1901 is a tentative finding that, if borne out in further studies, suggests that precipitation projections using these regions and models could overestimate future drought risk and underestimate future flooding risk, assuming all other factors equal.},

abstract = {Abstract. Contemporary climate warming over the Arctic is accelerating mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet through increasing surface melt, emphasizing the need to closely monitor its surface mass balance in order to improve sea-level rise predictions. Snow accumulation is the largest component of the ice sheet's surface mass balance, but in situ observations thereof are inherently sparse and models are difficult to evaluate at large scales. Here, we quantify recent Greenland accumulation rates using ultra-wideband (2–6.5 GHz) airborne snow radar data collected as part of NASA's Operation IceBridge between 2009 and 2012. We use a semiautomated method to trace the observed radiostratigraphy and then derive annual net accumulation rates for 2009–2012. The uncertainty in these radar-derived accumulation rates is on average 14 {\%}. A comparison of the radar-derived accumulation rates and contemporaneous ice cores shows that snow radar captures both the annual and long-term mean accumulation rate accurately. A comparison with outputs from a regional climate model (MAR) shows that this model matches radar-derived accumulation rates in the ice sheet interior but produces higher values over southeastern Greenland. Our results demonstrate that snow radar can efficiently and accurately map patterns of snow accumulation across an ice sheet and that it is valuable for evaluating the accuracy of surface mass balance models.},

The regional model simulations largely reflect the circulation bias patterns of the driving global models in the historical period, indicating the importance of lateral and lower boundary conditions. However, local differences occur as a reduced winter 2-m air temperature bias over the Arctic Ocean and increased cold biases over land areas in RCA. The projected changes are dominated by a strong warming in the Arctic, exceeding 15°K in autumn and winter over the Arctic Ocean in RCP8.5, strongly increased precipitation and reduced sea-level pressure. Near-surface temperature and precipitation are linearly related in the Arctic. The wintertime inversion strength is reduced, leading to a less stable stratification of the Arctic atmosphere. The diurnal temperature range is reduced in all seasons. The large-scale change patterns are dominated by the surface and lateral boundary conditions so future response is similar in RCA and the driving global models. However, the warming over the Arctic Ocean is smaller in RCA; the warming over land is larger in winter and spring but smaller in summer. The future response of winter cloud cover is opposite in RCA and the GCMs. Precipitation changes in RCA are much larger during summer than in the global models and more small-scale change patterns occur.},

abstract = {A newly digitized record of snow depth from the Abisko Scientific Research Station in northern Sweden covers the period 1913-present. Mean snow depths were taken from paper records of measurements made on a profile comprising 10 permanent stakes. This long-term record yields snow depths consistent with two other shorter term Abisko records: measurements made at another 10-stake profile (1974-present) and at a single stake (1956-present). The measurement interval is variable, ranging from daily to monthly, and there are no data for about half of the winter months in the period 1930-1956. To fill the gaps, we use a simple snowpack model driven by concurrent temperature and precipitation measurements at Abisko. Model snow depths are similar to observed; differences between the two records are comparable to those between profile and single stake measurements. For both model and observed snow depth records, the most statistically significant trend is in winter mean snow depths, amounting to an increase of about 2 cm or 5{\%} of the mean per decade over the whole measurement period, and 10{\%} per decade since the 1930-40s, but all seasonal means of snow depth show positive trends on the longest timescales. However, the start, end, and length of the snow season do not show any statistically significant long-term trends. Finally, the relation between the Arctic Oscillation index and Abisko temperature, precipitation and snow depth is positive and highly significant, with the best correlations for winter.},

The simulations show a high spatial and temporal variability of the recent 2-m air temperature increase in the Arctic. The maximum warming occurs north of Novaya Zemlya in the Kara Sea and Barents Sea between March 2003 and 2012 and is responsible for up to a 20°C increase. Land-based observations confirm the increase but do not cover the maximum regions that are located over the ocean and sea ice. Also, the 30-km version of the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) is used to verify the CCLM for the overlapping time period 2002/03?2011/12. The differences between CCLM and ASR 2-m air temperatures vary slightly within 1°C for the ocean and sea ice area. Thus, ASR captures the extreme warming as well. The monthly 2-m air temperatures of observations and ERA-Interim data show a large variability for the winters 1979?2016. Nevertheless, the air temperature rise since the beginning of the twenty-first century is up to 8 times higher than in the decades before. The sea ice decrease is identified as the likely reason for the warming. The vertical temperature profiles show that the warming has a maximum near the surface, but a 0.5°C yr?1 increase is found up to 2 km. CCLM, ASR, and also the coarser resolved ERA-Interim data show that February and March are the months with the highest 2-m air temperature increases, averaged over the ocean and sea ice area north of 70°N; for CCLM the warming amounts to an average of almost 5°C for 2002/03?2011/12.},

abstract = {The influence of uncertainties in gridded observational reference data on regional climate model (RCM) evaluation is quantified on a pan-European scale. Three different reference data sets are considered: the coarse-resolved E-OBS data set, a compilation of regional high-resolution gridded products (HR) and the European-scale MESAN reanalysis. Five high-resolution ERA-Interim-driven RCM experiments of the EURO-CORDEX initiative are evaluated against each of these references over eight European sub-regions and considering a range of performance metrics for mean daily temperature and daily precipitation. The spatial scale of the evaluation is 0.22°, i.e. the grid spacing of the coarsest data set in the exercise (E-OBS). While the three reference grids agree on the overall mean climatology, differences can be pronounced over individual regions. These differences partly translate into RCM evaluation uncertainty. For most cases observational uncertainty is smaller than RCM uncertainty. Nevertheless, for individual sub-regions and performance metrics observational uncertainty can dominate. This is especially true for precipitation and for metrics targeting the wet-day frequency, the pattern correlation and the distributional similarity. In some cases the spatially averaged mean bias can also be considerably affected. An illustrative ranking exercise highlights the overall effect of observational uncertainty on RCM ranking. Over individual sub-domains, the choice of a specific reference can modify RCM ranks by up to four levels (out of five RCMs). For most cases, however, RCM ranks are stable irrespective of the reference. These results provide a twofold picture: model uncertainty dominates for most regions and for most performance metrics considered, and observational uncertainty plays a minor role. For individual cases, however, observational uncertainty can be pronounced and needs to be definitely taken into account. Results can, to some extent, also depend on the treatment of precipitation undercatch in the observational reference.},

abstract = {Climate models robustly project a strong overall summer warming across Europe showing a characteristic north-south gradient with enhanced warming and drying in southern Europe. However, the processes that are responsible for this pattern are not fully understood. We here employ an extended surrogate or pseudo-warming approach to disentangle the contribution of different mechanisms to this response pattern. The basic idea of the surrogate technique is to use a regional climate model and apply a large-scale warming to the lateral boundary conditions of a present-day reference simulation, while maintaining the relative humidity (and thus implicitly increasing the specific moisture content). In comparison to previous studies, our approach includes two important extensions: first, different vertical warming profiles are applied in order to separate the effects of a mean warming from lapse-rate effects. Second, a twin-design is used, in which the climate change signals are not only added to present-day conditions, but also subtracted from a scenario experiment. We demonstrate that these extensions provide an elegant way to separate the full climate change signal into contributions from large-scale thermodynamic (TD), lapse-rate (LR), and circulation and other remaining effects (CO). The latter in particular include changes in land-ocean contrast and spatial variations of the SST warming patterns. We find that the TD effect yields a large-scale warming across Europe with no distinct latitudinal gradient. The LR effect, which is quantified for the first time in our study, leads to a stronger warming and some drying in southern Europe. It explains about 50 {\%} of the warming amplification over the Iberian Peninsula, thus demonstrating the important role of lapse-rate changes. The effect is linked to an extending Hadley circulation. The CO effect as inherited from the driving GCM is shown to further amplify the north-south temperature change gradient. In terms of mean summer precipitation the TD effect leads to a significant overall increase in precipitation all across Europe, which is compensated and regionally reversed by the LR and CO effects in particular in southern Europe.},

abstract = {Purpose: The study aims at examining the main features of precipitation distribution in Ukraine for three future periods in the 21st century and its changes relatively to the period of current climate 1991–2010 and standard WMO climatic period 1961–1990, based on a selected best regional climate model ensemble. Methodology: In order to obtained long-term precipitation projections for the territory of Ukraine with high resolution, we used regional climate models (RCMs) from the EU FP-6 project ENSEMBLES (ensembles-eu.metoffice.com) initiated with boundary conditions from the IPCC scenario SRES A1B. Previous statistical analysis of all RCMs' outputs, compared with the gridded observational data E-Obs (ecad.eu), showed that an ensemble of four regional climate models (REMO, RCA3-E, RRCM and RCA3-B) proves much better than other reproduced regional features and the annual distribution of precipitation over the territory of Ukraine. Therefore, this ensemble was used to calculate future precipitation fields. Further, we calculated precipitation values in each grid point (approximately 1200, with 25km step) on the basis of observation for the base period 1991–2010 and projected changes between each future and the base period by additive and multiplicative methods. Annual, seasonal and monthly changes of precipitation distributions were analysed for five different regions and on average for the whole territory of Ukraine in three future periods 2011–2030, 2031–2050, and 2081–2100. Maps of seasonal and annual changes in precipitation distribution in Ukraine are presented and analysed in the study. Findings: According to the obtained projections of precipitation changes for three 20-year future periods, ranges of changes for monthly precipitation sums are expected to be from −20{\%} to +42{\%} in 2011–2030, from −18{\%} to +37{\%} in 2031–2050, and from −40{\%} to +48{\%} in 2081–2100. In general, we project precipitation increase in the cold period of year and its decrease in the warm period of year. The annual precipitation numbers will slightly rise and their inter-annual distribution in most regions will remain continental, except for the east and south regions, where clear minimums and maximums of the annual precipitation distribution in the future will be smoothed out. Practical value: Long-term climatic forecast of precipitation change is an important scientific task. It may be used for example in strategic planning of the development of different economic sectors, such as agriculture, energy, transport; it may also be helpful in other biological and natural scientific studies. Keywords: precipitation, regional climate model, ensemble of models, climatic period.},

Statistical characteristics of 14 RCMs of the EU project FP-6 ENSEMBLES (ensembles-eu.metoffice.com) initiated with boundary conditions from 6 Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models calculated for the IPCC scenario SRES A1B have been presented and analyzed for two climatic periods in the past – standard 1961–1990 and recent 1991–2010. Different RCMs' ensembles have been examined and the optimal one of 10RCMs has been determined via evaluation by the gridded observational data E-Obs (ecad.eu). Bias correction by additive method has been applied to some RCMs' ensembles and substantial reduction in errors and improvement in projections have been demonstrated. Along with averaged over the territory of Ukraine statistical characteristics, spatial distribution of obtained differences between projected by some RCMs' ensemble and observed temperature in 1991–2010 has been received for all 1175 coordinate grids with approximate resolution 25 x 25 km within Ukraine's boundaries. It has proved that the projection of 10 RCMs ensemble has had minimum errors over the domain of Ukraine and can be recommended as the optimal.

These models perform well in simulating twentieth-century snowfall, although there is a positive bias in many re- gions. Annual snowfall is projected to decrease across much of the Northern Hemisphere during the twenty- first century, with increases projected at higher latitudes. On a seasonal basis, the transition zone between negative and positive snowfall trends corresponds approximately to the2108Cisotherm of the late twentieth- century mean surface air temperature, such that positive trends prevail in winter over large regions of Eurasia and North America. Redistributions of snowfall throughout the entire snow season are projected to occur— even in locations where there is little change in annual snowfall. Changes in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow contribute to decreases in snowfall across most Northern Hemisphere regions, while changes in total precipitation typically contribute to increases in snowfall.Asignal-to-noise analysis reveals that the projected changes insnowfall, based ontheRCP4.5 scenario, are likely to become apparentduringthe twenty-first century formost locations in theNorthernHemisphere. The snowfall signal emergesmore slowly than the temperature signal, suggesting that changes in snowfall are not likely to be early indicators of regional climate change. 1.},

abstract = {Climate models and/or their output are usually bias-corrected for climate impact studies. The underlying assumption of these corrections is that climate biases are essentially stationary between historical and future climate states. Under very strong climate change, the validity of this assumption is uncertain, so the practical benefit of bias corrections remains an open question. Here, this issue is addressed in the context of bias correcting the climate models themselves. Employing the ARPEGE, LMDZ and CanAM4 atmospheric models, we undertook experiments in which one centre's atmospheric model takes another centre's coupled model as observations during the historical period, to define the bias correction, and as the reference under future projections of strong climate change, to evaluate its impact. This allows testing of the stationarity assumption directly from the historical through future periods for three different models. These experiments provide evidence for the validity of the new bias-corrected model approach. In particular, temperature, wind and pressure biases are reduced by 40–60{\%} and, with few exceptions, more than 50{\%} of the improvement obtained over the historical period is on average preserved after 100 years of strong climate change. Below 3 °C global average surface temperature increase, these corrections globally retain 80{\%} of their benefit.},

abstract = {Rising propensity of precipitation extremes and concomitant decline of summer-monsoon rains are amongst the most distinctive hydroclimatic signals that have emerged over South Asia since 1950s. A clear understanding of the underlying causes driving these monsoon hydroclimatic signals has remained elusive. Using a state-of-the-art global climate model with high-resolution zooming over South Asia, we demonstrate that a juxtaposition of regional land-use changes, anthropogenic-aerosol forcing and the rapid warming signal of the equatorial Indian Ocean is crucial to produce the observed monsoon weakening in recent decades. Our findings also show that this monsoonal weakening significantly enhances occurrence of localized intense precipitation events, as compared to the global-warming response. A 21st century climate projection using the same high-resolution model indicates persistent decrease of monsoonal rains and prolongation of soil drying. Critical value-additions from this study include (1) realistic simulation of the mean and long-term historical trends in the Indian monsoon rainfall (2) robust attributions of changes in moderate and heavy precipitation events over Central India (3) a 21st century projection of drying trend of the South Asian monsoon. The present findings have profound bearing on the regional water-security, which is already under severe hydrological-stress.},

abstract = {Time series of South African temperatures were investigated for temporal and spatial trends for the period 1960 to 2003. For this purpose a total of 26 climate stations were utilized, with each having sufficient data available and not having undergone major moves or changes in exposure that would influence the homogeneity of their data series. The vast majority, a total of 23 stations, showed positive trends in their annual mean maximum temperature series, 13 of them significant, with trends higher for central stations than those closer to the coast. Annual mean minimum temperatures showed 21 stations having positive trends, with 18 significant. Stations not showing significantly positive trends in annual mean minimum temperatures were mostly situated in the central interior. The annual average temperature data series of 24 of the stations showed positive trends, with 18 of them significant. Trends of mean seasonal temperature showed that temperature trends are not consistent throughout the year, with the average trend for autumn showing a maximum and spring a minimum. Monthly trends of average annual temperatures showed large differences in trend between stations, and for each station between months, but similar tendencies in trend between months were found to exist for stations close by and also for groups of stations on a regional basis. Trends in diurnal temperature range are almost equally divided between positive and negative, with the positive trends in the central interior mainly being caused by large positive trends in maximum temperature. It is also shown that, in general, days and nights with relatively high temperatures have increased, while days and nights with relatively low temperatures have decreased. The effects of urbanization on temperature trends are investigated, and the conclusion is that most stations regarded as urban stations are still useful for trend analysis; being situated on the outskirts of cities they are, therefore, not substantially influenced by the urban heat island.

abstract = {The aim of this study is to update the analysis of historical rainfall trends with reference to the work from previous studies, through optimizing the highest spatial resolution with the longest possible period of analysis, i.e., 1921–2015. Two interlinked datasets, namely the district rainfall and individual rainfall stations datasets were used for the trend analyses, namely, daily time series of 60 individual rainfall stations and the daily district rainfall of 88 of 94 rainfall districts in South Africa. The extreme precipitation indices defined by the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices were applied. In general, the results show an increase in rainfall for most rainfall stations in the southern interior of South Africa, and indications of decreases in rainfall in the far northern and north-eastern parts. The increase in the annual rainfall in the south is reflected in the seasonal trends, where summer rainfall shows a similar increase, but also extends into the central interior. For other seasons, most of the country shows no significant historical trends in annual total rainfall. From the extreme rainfall analyses, an increase in daily rainfall extremes in the southern to western interior is apparent. Also, most of the country experienced increases in the intensity of daily rainfall, which confirms global results in general. Decreases in rainfall from wet spells were noted in most places over the east and north-east, while the southern and eastern parts along the escarpment experienced shorter annual dry spells. This study improves on previous studies in the region by more than doubling the analysis period, largely eliminating the influence that decadal-scale cycles might have on analyses over shorter periods. However, some differences in the trend results compared to previous studies are apparent, e.g., less pronounced drying in the east and the previously observed increase in rainfall in the western and southern interior not extending as far as the south-western Cape. The observed trends broadly confirm those of projected changes in summer rainfall, i.e., an increase in the west and decrease in the east.},

The utilized weather stations had limited gaps in their time series, did not undergo major moves, or had their exposure compromised during the study period, as to influence the homogeneity of their time series. The indices calculated were forthcoming from those developed by the WMO/CLIVAR Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), but only those applicable to the South African climate were selected. The general result is that warm extremes increased and cold extremes decreased for all of the weather stations. The trends however vary on a regional basis, both in magnitude and statistical significance, broadly indicating that the western half, as well as parts of the northeast and east of South Africa, show relatively stronger increases in warm extremes and decreases in cold extremes than elsewhere in the country. These regions coincide to a large degree with the thermal regimes in South Africa which are susceptible to extreme temperatures. The annual absolute maximum and minimum temperatures do not reflect the general trends displayed by the other indices, showing that individual extreme events cannot always be associated with observed long-term climatic trends. The analyses of longer time series than the common period indicate that it is highly likely that warming accelerated since the mid-1960s in South Africa.},

abstract = {The relevant literature on extreme rainfall events in the Pacific remains relatively sparse compared to other regions (e.g. the coterminous United States, Europe, etc.). Moreover, several recent reports on climate in the Pacific mention the paucity of extremes information and often list ‘trends in historical climate' as a necessary next step. This scientific assessment meets this need by examining historical trends in and drivers of extreme rainfall events across the entire Pacific Basin, inclusive from Alaska southward to Australia, and longitudinally from the Philippines eastward to North America, with an emphasis on island and coastal locations (within 200 km of the coastline). There is evidence of a general decrease in the frequency of annual extreme rainfall events, yet the amount of extreme precipitation contributing to annual and seasonal totals appears to be on the rise. Region-wide, the number of consecutive dry days is increasing for those locations that are already dry, while the number of consecutive wet days is increasing for the already wet locales. The data for extreme rainfall statistics are considered to be relatively high quality for trend detection, while the level of understanding of the physical causes behind extreme rainfall is positively high. Since the ability to analyze the changes in historical rainfall extremes with some confidence is relatively recent, understanding is expected to improve in the future with the advancement of new datasets and ‘climate reanalysis' projects.},

abstract = {Aridity is typically associated with deep and dry daytime boundary layers, stable nighttime stratification, divergent flows, and limited large-scale moisture advection. All these factors are paramount in regulating the hydroclimatology of hyperarid regions, resulting in extremely intermittent-and often intense-local precipitation patterns. However, the link between synoptic-scale forcing and intense precipitation over arid regions has been scarcely investigated in the literature and still remains exceedingly unexplored. We present here a diagnostic study of intense precipitation in the Central Arabian Peninsula, based on the analysis of local extreme signatures embedded in synoptic patterns. Special emphasis is given to the genesis of winter extremes over the Peninsula, and to possible effects of synchronization between the atmospheric circulation over the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Based on composites of the tropospheric circulation for a large ensemble of intense events, we show that moisture necessary to trigger winter extremes over the Peninsula starts to build up in average 8 days before heavy rainfall occurrence, mainly as a consequence of the interplay between the Mediterranean and the Monsoonal circulation. Moisture advection is in turn associated with an upper troposphere cyclonic circulation and pronounced potential vorticity intrusions. Overall, our results demonstrate how large-scale precursors can be effectively used to improve the predictability of rainfall extremes in hyperarid regions.},

abstract = {This paper analyses trends in temperature in Fiji, using data from more stations (10) and longer periods (52-78 years) than previous studies. All the stations analysed show a statistically significant trend in both maximum and minimum temperature, with increases ranging from 0.08 to 0.23°C per decade. More recent temperatures show a higher rate of increase, particularly in maximum temperature (0.18 to 0.69°C per decade from 1989 to 2008). This clear signal of climate change is consistent with that found in previous studies of temperatures in Fiji and other Pacific Islands. Trends in extreme values show an even stronger signal of climate change than that for mean temperatures. Our preliminary analysis of daily maxima at 6 stations indicates that for 4 of them (Suva, Labasa, Vunisea and Rotuma) there has been a tripling in the number of days per year with temperature {\textgreater}32°C between 1970 and 2008. The correlations between annual mean maximum (minimum) temperature and year are mostly strong: for about half the stations the correlation coefficient exceeds 60{\%} over 50+ years. Trends do not vary systematically with location of station. At all 7 stations for which both trends are available there is no statistically significant difference between the trends in maximum and minimum temperatures.},

abstract = {This study examines the potential impacts of 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming (GWL15 and GWL20) on rainfall onset dates (RODs), rainfall cessation dates (RCDs), and length of the rainy season (LRS) in West Africa under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Nineteen multi-model multi-ensemble simulation datasets from eight regional climate models that participated in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment were used for the study. The ability of the model ensemble mean to reproduce the characteristics of RODs, RCDs and LRS for past climate were evaluated using two observed datasets. The impacts of GWL15 and GWL20 on each parameter were quantified and compared. The models reproduce the characteristics of RODs, RCDs, and LRS as observed in the historical climate over West Africa though with few biases. The models projected the western and eastern Sahel as hot-spots for a delayed ROD and reduced LRS in the 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer climate under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. A delayed RCD and longer LRS are projected over the western part of the Guinea coast. The uncertainties associated with the projections are high for RCD but lower for ROD and LRS. While an increase in global warming from 1.5 °C-2 °C enhances late ROD over the entire West Africa under the RCP4.5, it fosters early ROD over the Sahel zone under the RCP8.5. It also encourages a decrease in the LRS over the Guinea zone and an increase in LRS over the Sahel zone, but produces opposite results under RCP8.5. The results of the study have application in reducing the impacts of global warming over West Africa.},

The analysis performed herein on maximum seasonal snow depth points to a robust negative trend in this variable for the period of winter 1960/1961–winter 2014/2015. This conclusion is applicable to North America. Maximum snow depth is also mostly decreasing for those European stations analyzed. Research studies show generally negative trends in snow cover extent and snow water equivalent across both North America and Eurasia. These results are mostly, but not fully, consistent with simple hypotheses for the effects of global warming on snow characteristics.},

abstract = {There is an increasing interest in examining long-term trends in measures of snow climatology. An examination of the U.S. daily snowfall records for 1900-2004 revealed numerous apparent inconsistencies. For example, long-term snowfall trends among neighboring lake-effect stations differ greatly from insignificant to +100{\%} century-1. Internal inconsistencies in the snow records, such as a lack of upward trends in maximum seasonal snow depth at stations with large upward trends in snowfall, point to inhomogeneities. Nationwide, the frequency of daily observations with a 10:1 snowfall-to-liquid-equivalent ratio declined from 30{\%} in the 1930s to a current value of around 10{\%}, a change that is clearly due to observational practice. There then must be biases in cold-season liquid-equivalent precipitation, or snowfall, or both. An empirical adjustment of snow-event, liquid-equivalent precipitation indicates that the potential biases can be statistically significant. Examples from this study show that there are nonclimatic issues that complicate the identification of and significantly change the trends in snow variables. Thus, great care should be taken in interpretation of time series of snow-related variables from the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) network. Furthermore, full documentation of optional practices should be required of network observers so that future users of these data can properly account for such practices. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

For the present-day climate of 21 years from 1983 to 2003, models were forced with observed historical sea surface temperatures (SST). For the future climate of 21 years from 2079 to 2099, models were forced with future SST distributions projected by the models of the Fifth phase of Couple Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Ensemble simulations for four different SST distributions and three different cumulus convection schemes were conducted to evaluate the uncertainty of projection. The simulations consistently project the increase of precipitation over eastern China for almost all months. In June, precipitation decreases over Japan and increases over the ocean to the south of Japan. The geographical distribution of precipitation change tends to depend relatively on the cumulus convection scheme and horizontal resolution of models rather than on SST distributions. The time evolution of pentad mean precipitation over Japan indicates the delay in the onset of Japanese rainy season in June. This delay can be attributed to the decrease of water vapor transport toward Japan associated with the southward shift of the subtropical high. Change in the subtropical high can be interpreted as the southward shift of the local Hadley circulation. The intensity of precipitation increases over most part of East Asia, while the possibility of drought will increase over Japan, the East China Sea and the area to the south of Japan.},

The 20, 60 and 180-km grid size version of this model were used to evaluate the dependence of model performance on horizontal resolution. The dependence of cumulus convection scheme on model performance was also investigated. All the MRI-AGCM3.2 models and the CMIP5 models were forced with observed historical sea surface temperatures for the period 1979--2003 (25 years). The reproducibility of the MRI-AGCM3.2 models is higher or comparable to that of the CMIP5 models for seasonal average precipitation, the seasonal March of rainy zone and extreme precipitation events. Especially in summer, the advantage of the MRI-AGCM3.2 models over the CMIP5 models is striking in terms of various skill measures. This is partly due to the higher horizontal resolution of the MRI-AGCM3.2 models, but the performance of models is also sensitive to and depends on cumulus convection scheme. The better simulation of summer precipitation over East Asia by the MRI-AGCM3.2 models can be partly attributed to the better simulation of precipitation, the West Pacific Subtropical High and the local Hadley circulation in the tropics. This study highlights that higher reproducibility of summertime precipitation over East Asia requires proper simulation not only for tropical circulation but also for the strong dynamical linkage between precipitation over East Asia and tropical circulation.},

The precipitation efficiency defined as precipitation change per 1° surface air temperature warming is evaluated. The global average of precipitation efficiency for annual average precipitation was less than the maximum value expected by thermodynamical theory, indicating that dynamical atmospheric circulation is acting to reduce the conversion efficiency from water vapor to precipitation.

Over the Arctic, the conversion rate from water vapor to precipitation per one degree temperature increase is larger for PAVE than for R5d, which is opposite to the tropics and mid-latitudes. The increases in PAVE, SDII, and R5d can be partly attributed to an increase in water vapor associated with increasing temperatures, and to an increase in the horizontal transport of water vapor from low to high latitudes associated with transient eddies.},

A comparison of future and control simulations enables us to quantify the expected change in snowpack for the next century. Snow simulations are performed on 20 Regional Climate Model (RCM) grid points over the Pyrenees, covering the entire north-south and east-west transects; data were downscaled for four different altitudinal levels (1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 m a.s.l.). This procedure yields a relatively complete picture of the expected impacts of climate change in the Pyrenees, covering horizontal spatial variability as well as altitudinal gradients. According to the HIRHAM model projections following different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, the thickness and duration of snowpack in the Pyrenees will decrease dramatically over the next century, especially in the central and eastern sectors of the Spanish Pyrenees. The magnitude of these impacts will follow a marked altitudinal gradient: the maximum accumulated snow water equivalent may decrease by up to 78{\%}, and the season with snow cover may be reduced by up to 70{\%} at 1500 m a.s.l. The magnitude of the impacts decreases rapidly with increasing altitude; snowpack characteristics will remain largely similar in the highest sectors. The decline of the snowpack would be reduced by half if a medium-low emission scenario was considered (B2) instead of the medium-high concentrations of greenhouse gas assumed in the A2 scenario. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Lack of long-term scientific observations makes it difficult to assess whether Arctic changes statistically represent a ‘new Arctic' climate. Here we use five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 class Earth system model large ensembles to show how the Arctic is transitioning from a dominantly frozen state and to quantify the nature and timing of an emerging new Arctic climate in sea ice, air temperatures and precipitation phase (rain versus snow). Our results suggest that Arctic climate has already emerged in sea ice. Air temperatures will emerge under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario in the early- to mid-twenty-first century, followed by precipitation-phase changes. Despite differences in mean state and forced response, these models show striking similarities in their anthropogenically forced emergence from internal variability in Arctic sea ice, surface temperatures and precipitation-phase changes.},

abstract = {In Qu{\'{e}}bec, Eastern Canada, snowmelt runoff contributes more than 30{\%} of the annual energy reserve for hydroelectricity production, and uncertainties in annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) over the region are one of the main constraints for improved hydrological forecasting. Current satellite-based methods for mapping SWE over Qu{\'{e}}bec's main hydropower basins do not meet Hydro-Qu{\'{e}}bec operational requirements for SWE accuracies with less than 15{\%} error. This paper assesses the accuracy of the GlobSnow-2 (GS-2) SWE product, which combines microwave satellite data and in situ measurements, for hydrological applications in Qu{\'{e}}bec. GS-2 SWE values for a 30-year period (1980 to 2009) were compared with space- and time-matched values from a comprehensive dataset of in situ SWE measurements (a total of 38,990 observations in Eastern Canada). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GS-2 SWE product is 94.1 ± 20.3 mm, corresponding to an overall relative percentage error (RPE) of 35.9{\%}. The main sources of uncertainty are wet and deep snow conditions (when SWE is higher than 150 mm), and forest cover type. However, compared to a typical stand-alone brightness temperature channel difference algorithm, the assimilation of surface information in the GS-2 algorithm clearly improves SWE accuracy by reducing the RPE by about 30{\%}. Comparison of trends in annual mean and maximum SWE between surface observations and GS-2 over 1980–2009 showed agreement for increasing trends over southern Qu{\'{e}}bec, but less agreement on the sign and magnitude of trends over northern Qu{\'{e}}bec. Extended at a continental scale, the GS-2 SWE trends highlight a strong regional variability.},

abstract = {The study of regional rainfall trends over South Asia is critically important for food security and economy, as both these factors largely depend on the availability of water. In this study, South Asian summer monsoon rainfall trends on seasonal and monthly (June--September) time scales have been investigated using three observational data sets. Our analysis identify a dipole-type structure in rainfall trends over the region north of the Indo--Pak subcontinent, with significant increasing trends over the core monsoon region of Pakistan and significant decreasing trends over the central-north India and adjacent areas. The dipole is also evident in monthly rainfall trend analyses, which is more prominent in July and August. We show, in particular, that the strengthening of northward moisture transport over the Arabian Sea is a likely reason for the significant positive trend of rainfall in the core monsoon region of Pakistan. In contrast, over the central-north India region, the rainfall trends are significantly decreasing due to the weakening of northward moisture transport over the Bay of Bengal. The leading empirical orthogonal functions clearly show the strengthening (weakening) patterns of vertically integrated moisture transport over the Arabian Sea (Bay of Bengal) in seasonal and monthly interannual time scales. The regression analysis between the principal components and rainfall confirm the dipole pattern over the region. Our results also suggest that the extra-tropical phenomena could influence the mean monsoon rainfall trends over Pakistan by enhancing the cross-equatorial flow of moisture into the Arabian Sea.},

abstract = {Changma, which is a vital part of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) system, plays a critical role in modulating water and energy cycles in Korea. Better understanding of its long-term variability and change is therefore a matter of scientific and societal importance. It has been indicated that characteristics of Changma have undergone significant interdecadal changes in association with the mid-1970s global-scale climate shift and the mid-1990s EASM shift. This paper reviews and revisits the characteristics on the long-term changes of Changma focusing on the underlying mechanisms for the changes. The four important features are manifested mainly during the last few decades: 1) mean and extreme rainfalls during Changma period from June to September have been increased with the amplification of diurnal cycle of rainfall, 2) the dry spell between the first and second rainy periods has become shorter, 3) the rainfall amount as well as the number of rainy days during August have significantly increased, probably due to the increase in typhoon landfalls, and 4) the relationship between the Changma rainfall and Western Pacific Subtropical High on interannual time scale has been enhanced. The typhoon contribution to the increase in heavy rainfall is attributable to enhanced interaction between typhoons and midlatitude baroclinic environment. It is noted that the change in the relationship between Changma and the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) over the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans is a key factor in the long-term changes of Changma and EASM. Possible sources for the recent mid-1990s change include 1) the tropical dipole-like SST pattern between the central Pacific and Indo-Pacific region (the global warming hiatus pattern), 2) the recent intensification of tropical SST gradients among the Indian Ocean, the western Pacific, and the eastern Pacific, and 3) the tropical Atlantic SST warming.},

abstract = {Published findings on climate change impacts on tropical cyclones (TCs) in the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee Region are assessed. We focus on observed TC changes in the western North Pacific (WNP) basin, including frequency, intensity, precipitation, track pattern, and storm surge. Results from an updated survey of impacts of past TC activity on various Members of the Typhoon Committee are also reported. Existing TC datasets continue to show substantial interdecadal variations in basin-wide TC frequency and intensity in the WNP. There has been encouraging progress in improving the consensus between different datasets concerning intensity trends. A statistically significant northwestward shift in WNP TC tracks since the 1980s has been documented. There is low-to-medium confidence in a detectable poleward shift since the 1940s in the average latitude where TCs reach their peak intensity in the WNP. A worsening of storm inundation levels is believed to be occurring due to sea level rise-due in part to anthropogenic influence-assuming all other factors equal. However, we are not aware that any TC climate change signal has been convincingly detected in WNP sea level extremes data. We also consider detection and attribution of observed changes based on an alternative Type II error avoidance perspective.},

The summertime warming extends the thermal low at the surface from South Asia across the Middle East over North Africa, as the hot desert climate intensifies and becomes more extreme. Observations and model calculations of the recent past consistently show increasing heat extremes, which are projected to accelerate in future. The number of warm days and nights may increase sharply. On average in the MENA, the maximum temperature during the hottest days in the recent past was about 43 °C, which could increase to about 46 °C by the middle of the century and reach almost 50 °C by the end of the century, the latter according to the RCP8.5 (business-as-usual) scenario.

In recent years (2009 and 2011), regionally extreme snowfall anomalies in Dronning Maud Land, in the Atlantic sector of East Antarctica, have been observed. It has been unclear, however, whether these anomalies can be ascribed to natural decadal variability, or whether they could signal the beginning of a long-term increase of snowfall. Here we use output of a regional atmospheric climate model, evaluated with available firn core records and gravimetry observations, and show that such episodes had not been seen previously in the satellite climate data era (1979). Comparisons with historical data that originate from firn cores, one with records extending back to the 18th century, confirm that accumulation anomalies of this scale have not occurred in the past {\~{}}60 years, although comparable anomalies are found further back in time. We examined several regional climate model projections, describing various warming scenarios into the 21st century. Anomalies with magnitudes similar to the recently observed ones were not present in the model output for the current climate, but were found increasingly probable toward the end of the 21st century.},

In this study, we use a novel pair of climate model ensembles to identify a simulated spatial signature of ozone depletion-forced AIS precipitation change. Distinct areas of little change or precipitation decrease, arising from interaction between ozone depletion-forced atmospheric circulation changes and ice sheet topography, are outweighed by large-scale precipitation increases. This signature bears notable similarities to a new ice core-based reconstruction of AIS accumulation change and yields a significant increase in annual integrated precipitation (38 ± 10 Gt/year over the 1986–2005 period or 51 ± 11 Gt/year over the 1991–2005 period). Remarkably, this simulated ozone depletion-forced precipitation change is of a similar absolute magnitude to recent observed AIS mass loss trends and as a consequence, it may play a role in dampening recent AIS sea level rise contributions.},

CESM correctly simulates present-day Antarctic sea ice extent, large-scale atmospheric circulation and near-surface climate, but fails to simulate the recent expansion of Antarctic sea ice. The present-day Antarctic ice sheet SMB equals 2280 ± 131 Gtyear-1, which concurs with existing independent estimates of AIS SMB. When forced by two CMIP5 climate change scenarios (high mitigation scenario RCP2.6 and high-emission scenario RCP8.5), CESM projects an increase of Antarctic ice sheet SMB of about 70 Gtyear-1 per degree warming. This increase is driven by enhanced snowfall, which is partially counteracted by more surface melt and runoff along the ice sheet's edges. This intensifying hydrological cycle is predominantly driven by atmospheric warming, which increases (1) the moisture-carrying capacity of the atmosphere, (2) oceanic source region evaporation, and (3) summer AIS cloud liquid water content.},

abstract = {A method to prepare a set of four climate scenarios for the Netherlands is presented. These scenarios for climate change in 2050 and 2085 (compared to present-day) are intended for general use in climate change adaptation in the Netherlands. An ensemble of eight simulations with the global model EC-Earth and the regional climate model RACMO2 (run at 12 km resolution) is used. For each scenario time horizon, two target values of the global mean temperature rise are chosen based on the spread in the CMIP5 simulations. Next, the corresponding time periods in the EC-Earth/RACMO2 simulations are selected in which these target values of the global temperature rise are reached. The model output for these periods is then resampled using blocks of 5 yr periods. The rationale of resampling is that natural variations in the EC-Earth/RACMO2 ensemble are used to represent (part of the) uncertainty in the CMIP5 projections. Samples are then chosen with the aim of reconstructing the spread in seasonal temperature and precipitation changes in CMIP5 for the Netherlands. These selected samples form the basis of the scenarios. The resulting four scenarios represent 50-80{\%} of the CMIP5 spread for summer and winter changes in seasonal means as well as a limited number of monthly statistics (warm, cold, wet and dry months). The strong point of the method - also in relation to the previous set of the climate scenarios for the Netherlands issued in 2006 - is that it preserves nearly all physical inter-variable consistencies as they exist in the original model output in both space and time.},

abstract = {The Paris Agreement of COP21 set a goal of holding global average temperature increases to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. This is particularly relevant for the African context where temperatures are likely to warm faster than the global average and where the magnitude of change will be regionally heterogeneous. Additionally, many biogeophysical and socioeconomic systems are particularly vulnerable to change in both means and extremes. In this paper we contextualise the lack of regional climate information over Africa at global warming levels (GWLs) of 1.5 and 2°C above pre-industrial levels through a short review of the literature. We show most studies that provide information over Africa under specific GWLs have used data from global models, however global models poorly resolve local scale forcing (e.g. topography) nor the internal climate variability of a region. Although downscaling using regional climate models can address these issues we find only one paper that has used downscaled data for GWL studies over Africa. Articles in this focus collection use data from global climate models and the co-ordinated regional downscaling experiment (CORDEX) to elucidate the regional and local scale climate responses to various warming levels. This may provide information that contributes meaningfully to the UNFCCC negotiation process and also for the development of adaptation and mitigation policies.},

East Asia (EA) is a populous region, and it is crucial to assess the changes in extreme high-temperature events in this region under different climate change scenarios. The Community Earth System Model low-warming experiment data were applied to investigate the changes in the mean and extreme high temperatures in EA under 1.5°C and 2°C warming conditions above preindustrial levels. The results show that the magnitude of warming in EA is approximately 0.2°C higher than the global mean. Most populous subregions, including eastern China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan, will see more intense, more frequent, and longer-lasting extreme temperature events under 1.5°C and 2°C warming. The 0.5°C lower warming will help avoid 35{\%}–46{\%} of the increases in extreme high-temperature events in terms of intensity, frequency, and duration in EA with maximal avoidance values (37{\%}–49{\%}) occurring in Mongolia. Thus, it is beneficial for EA to limit the warming target to 1.5°C rather than 2°C.},

An ensemble of climate simulations, with resolution of 0.44°, was conducted by downscaling four GCMs: CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH, HadGEM2, and MPI-ESM-LR. The CCLM outputs were compared against different observations and reanalysis datasets. Results showed strong seasonal variability of CCLM's ability in reproducing climatological means, variability and extremes. The bias of the simulated summer temperatures is generally smaller than that of the winter temperatures; additionally, areas where CCLM adds value to the driving GCMs in simulating temperature are larger in the winter than in the summer. The CCLM outperforms GCMs in terms of generating climatological precipitation means and daily precipitation distributions for most regions in the winter; however, this is not always the case for the summer. It was found that CCLM biases are partly inherited from GCMs and are significantly shaped by structural biases of the CCLM. Furthermore, downscaled simulations show an added value in capturing features of consecutive wet days for the tropics and of consecutive dry days for northern areas to 30°N. We found considerable uncertainty from reanalysis and observation datasets in temperatures and precipitation climatological means for some regions that rival bias values of GCMs and CCLM simulations. We recommend carefully selecting reference datasets when evaluating modeled climate means.},

abstract = { AbstractTime series of global or regional average surface air temperature (SAT) are fundamental to climate change studies. A number of studies have developed several national and regional SAT series for China, but because of the diversity of the meteorological observational sites, the different quality control routines for processing the data, and the inconsistency of the statistical methods used, they differ in their long-term trends. This paper assesses the similarities and differences of the existing time series of the annual average SAT for China that are based upon historical meteorological observations since the 1900s. The results indicate that the China average is similar to the series for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) landmass, except that the initial warming of the NH series derived from the CRUTEM3/4 datasets, which represent global historical land surface air temperatures and near-surface air temperature anomalies over land, respectively, ends earlier (before the early 1940s) than in China's series. A major difference among the existing China average time series is the 1940s warmth, a period when there were very few observations across the country because of World War II. The SAT anomalies for China during the 1930s to 1940s have been reduced by improved homogeneity assessment compared to previous estimates. The new improved time series is in better agreement with both the historical twentieth-century reanalysis data and the historical climate simulation of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models. The new time series also shows the slowdown of the warming trend during the past 18 yr (1998–2015). The best estimate of a linear trend for increases in temperature with a 95{\%} uncertainty range is 0.121° ± 0.009°C decade–1 for 1900–2015, indicating that the improved homogeneity assessment for China leads to a slightly greater trend than that based on raw data (0.107° ± 0.009°C decade–1). },

abstract = {Abstract Understanding the link between future changes in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and global warming levels is of great importance for regional climate change adaptation and mitigation in East Asia. Here, we analyze the projected changes in EASM circulation and precipitation under different warming levels from 1.5 to 5 °C above the preindustrial global mean temperature, using large-ensemble simulations conducted with Canadian Earth System Model version 2. We find that the model projects enhanced monsoon circulation and precipitation with global warming. The 850-hPa meridional winds, precipitation, and 500-hPa vertical ascending motion will be enhanced nonlinearly, while the total column precipitable water will increase quasi-linearly. The increase in precipitable water in the wet EASM region is only slightly greater than global average but the increase in precipitation is much greater than global one, with enhanced 500-hPa vertical ascending motion contrary to global mean. The increased low-level land-sea thermal contrast leads to the enhanced EASM meridional circulation and thus bring a large amount of moisture into Eastern China, providing favorable conditions for additional increase in precipitation. A simplified moisture budget analysis shows that the dynamic component related to strengthening monsoon circulation plays dominant role in the increase in EASM precipitation when the global temperature increases by more than approximately 2 °C, while the thermodynamic component caused by increased water vapor is important when the warming is smaller.},

abstract = {During 1960–2010, the air temperature in the arid region of northwest China had a significant rising trend (P {\textless} 0.001), at a rate of 0.343°C/decade, higher than the average of China (0.25°C/decade) and that of the entire globe (0.13°C/decade) for the same period. Based on the analysis of the data from 74 meteorological stations in the region for 1960–2010, we found that among the four seasons the temperature change of winter has been playing the most important role in the yearly change in this region. We also found that the winter temperature in this region has a strong association with the Siberian High (correlation coefficient: R = −0.715) and the greenhouse gas emission (R = 0.51), and between the two the former is stronger. We thus suggest that the weakening of the Siberian High during the 1980s to 1990s on top of the steady increasing of the greenhouse emission is the main reason for the higher rate of the temperature rise in the arid region of the northwest China.},

abstract = {The 1981–2014 climatology and variability of the March–May eastern Horn of Africa boreal spring wet season are examined using precipitation, upper- and lower-level winds, low-level specific humidity, and convective available potential energy (CAPE), with the aim of better understanding the establishment of the wet season and the cause of the recent observed decline. At 850 mb, the development of the wet season is characterized by increasing specific humidity and winds that veer from northeasterly in February to southerly in June and advect moisture into the region, in agreement with an earlier study. Equally important, however, is a substantial weakening of the 200-mb climatological easterly winds in March. Likewise, the shutdown of the wet season coincides with the return of strong easterly winds in June. Similar changes are seen in the daily evolution of specific humidity and 200-mb wind when composited relative to the interannual wet season onset and end, with the easterlies decreasing (increasing) several days prior to the start (end) of the wet season. The 1981–2014 decrease in March–May precipitation has also coincided with an increase in 200-mb easterly winds, with no attendant change in specific humidity, leading to the conclusion that, while high values of specific humidity are an important ingredient of the wet season, the recent observed precipitation decline has resulted mostly from a strengthening of the 200-mb easterlies. This change in the easterly winds appears to be related to an increase in convection over the Indonesian region and in the associated outflow from that enhanced heat source.},

abstract = {Based on quality-controlled daily station data, long-term trends and variability of total and extreme precipitation indices during 1955–2014 were examined for Thailand. An analysis showed that while precipitation events have been less frequent across most of Thailand, they have become more intense. Moreover, the indices measuring the magnitude of intense precipitation events indicate a trend toward wetter conditions, with heavy precipitation contributing a greater fraction to annual totals. One consequence of this change is the increased frequency and severity of flash floods as recently evidenced in many parts of Thailand. On interannual-to-interdecadal time scales, significant relationships between variability of precipitation indices and the indices for the state of El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) were found. These results provide additional evidence that large-scale climate phenomena in the Pacific Ocean are remote drivers of variability in Thailand's total and extreme precipitation. Thailand tended to have greater amounts of precipitation and more extreme events during La Ni{\~{n}}a years and the PDO cool phase, and vice versa during El Ni{\~{n}}o years and the PDO warm phase. Another noteworthy finding is that in 2011 Thailand experienced extensive flooding in a year characterized by exceptionally extreme precipitation events. Our results are consistent with the regional studies for the Asia-Pacific Network. However, this study provides a more detailed picture of coherent trends at a station scale and documents changes that have occurred in the twenty-first century, both of which help to inform decisions concerning effective management strategies.},

The annually averaged DTR is evaluated for the present-day climate using two gridded datasets (HadGHCND and CRU). The DTR varies substantially between different CMIP5 models, particularly in the subtropics, and is generally underestimated. In future projections of the high emission scenario RCP8.5, the models disagree on both the sign and the magnitude of the change in DTR. Still, a majority of the models project a globally averaged reduction in the DTR, with an increase over Europe, a decrease over the Sahara desert and a substantial decrease in DTR at high latitudes in winter. The general DTR reduction is partly linked to the enhancement of the downwelling clear sky longwave radiation due to greenhouse gases. At high latitudes in winter, the decrease in DTR seems to be enforced by an increase in cloudiness, but in most other regions counteracted by decreases in cloud fraction. Changes in the hydrological cycle and in the clear sky shortwave radiation also impact the DTR. The DTR integrates many processes and neither the model differences in the DTR nor in the change in DTR can be attributed to a single parameter. Which variables that impact the model discrepancies vary both regionally and seasonally. However, clouds seem to matter in most regions and seasons and the evaporative fraction is important in summer.},

These datasets to large extent agree that in the twentieth century: (a) Mediterranean regional and global temperatures have warmed at a similar rate until the 1980s and (b) decadal variability determines a large uncertainty that prevents to identify long-term links between precipitation in the Mediterranean region and global temperature. However, in the twenty-first century, as mean global temperature increases, in the Mediterranean region, precipitation will decrease at a rate around − 20 mm/K or − 4{\%}/K and temperature will warm 20{\%} more than the global average. Warming will be particularly large in summer (approximately 50{\%} larger than global warming) and for the land areas located north of the basin (locally up to 100{\%} larger than global warming). Reduction of precipitation will affect all seasons in the central and southern Mediterranean areas, with maximum reduction for winter precipitation (− 7 mm/K or − 7{\%}/K for the southern Mediterranean region). For areas along the northern border of the Mediterranean region, reduction will be largest in summer (− 7 mm/K or − 9{\%}/K for the whole northern Mediterranean region), while they will not experience a significant reduction of precipitation in winter.},

We found that, relative to the historical experiment, water availability below normal conditions of the +1.5 and +2 °C experiments would decrease in the midlatitudes and the tropics, indicating that hydrological drought is likely to increase in warmer worlds. These cause more (less) people in East Asia, Central Europe, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (West Africa and Alaska/Northwest Canada) to be exposed to water shortage. Stabilizing warming at 1.5 °C instead of 2 °C would limit population impact in most of the regions, less effective in Alaska/Northwest Canada, Southeast Asia, and Amazon.

abstract = {Orographic precipitation and snowpack provide a vital water resource for the western U.S., while convective precipitation accounts for a significant part of annual precipitation in the eastern U.S. As a result, water managers are keenly interested in their fate under climate change. However, previous studies of water cycle changes in the U.S. have been conducted with climate models of relatively coarse resolution, leading to potential misrepresentation of key physical processes. This paper presents results from a high-resolution climate change simulation that permits convection and resolves mesoscale orography at 4-km grid spacing over much of North America using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Two 13-year simulations were performed, consisting of a retrospective simulation (October 2000–September 2013) with initial and boundary conditions from ERA-interim and a future climate sensitivity simulation with modified reanalysis-derived initial and boundary conditions through adding the CMIP5 ensemble-mean high-end emission scenario climate change. The retrospective simulation is evaluated by validating against Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) and an ensemble of gridded observational datasets. It shows overall good performance capturing the annual/seasonal/sub-seasonal precipitation and surface temperature climatology except for a summer dry and warm bias in the central U.S. In particular, the WRF seasonal precipitation agrees with SNOTEL observations within a few percent over the mountain ranges, providing confidence in the model's estimation of western U.S. seasonal snowfall and snowpack. The future climate simulation forced with warmer and moister perturbed boundary conditions enhances annual and winter-spring-fall seasonal precipitation over most of the contiguous United States (CONUS), but suppresses summertime precipitation in the central U.S. The WRF-downscaled climate change simulations provide a high-resolution dataset (i.e., High-Resolution CONUS downscaling, HRCONUS) to the community for studying one possible scenario of regional climate changes and impacts.},

abstract = { In this study over the Asian territory of Russia (ATR) (45° N–80° N, 60° E–180° E) for the period of 1979–2010 the temporal variability of the surface air temperature field was investigated. There are several climatic factors which can influence temperature variability including radiative balance at the top of atmosphere (TOA), heat balance at the surface, total cloud cover, and large-scale atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere. The contribution of these factors to temperature variability is also investigated. It was found that during the past decade, over the ATR, the process of warming prevails mainly in the warm season, but in the cold season it is either not as marked or there is cooling instead. In the winter season there is a positive relationship between temperature anomalies and anomalies in cloudiness, effective radiation, and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index. During the same period, a negative relationship between anomalies of temperature and anomalies of net radiation at the TOA, net shortwave radiation at the surface, and the Scandinavian (SCAND) index was observed. In the summer season, the relationship between temperature and cloudiness becomes negative and the relationship between temperature and atmospheric circulation indices decreases. For the period 2001–2010, radiative fluxes obtained from reanalysis data sets Japanese Reanalysis Data (JRA-25) and Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) were compared to satellite remotely sensed data project Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). It was found that there is a good agreement between estimates of the net radiation at the TOA calculated using reanalysis data and satellite data: the difference is about 1.5 W m−2 and the correlation coefficient is more than 0.7. As for the comparison of radiative fluxes estimates at the surface for clear sky, there is less difference between MERRA and CERES. So, during the period 2001–2010 the relation between atmospheric circulation and surface air temperature variability increased in winter months. Obtained regression models allow us to describe from 27{\%} to 82{\%} of temperature variability in different months if we take into account both circulation and radiative factors. },

Recent studies raise the matter of the AEM influence on the next Pacific ENSO episodes and also on the Indian Monsoon. This paper evaluates the response of four different atmospheric global circulation models, using the above-mentioned AEM sensitivity experiments, to study the tropical forcing associated with the Atlantic Ni{\~{n}}o mode. The results show a remote signal in both the Pacific and Indian basins. For a warm phase of the AEM the associated southward location of the ITCZ, with rising motions over the Equatorial Atlantic, leads to a global subsidence over the rest of the tropics, weakening the Asian Monsoon and favouring the La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions in the central Pacific. Although ocean-atmosphere coupled experiments are required to test the latter hypothesis, the present studies shows how the AEM is able to influence the rest of the tropics, a result with important implications on ENSO seasonal predictability. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {In this study, an ensemble of four multi-year climate simulations is performed with the regional climate model ALADIN to evaluate its ability to simulate the climate over North America in the CORDEX framework. The simulations differ in their driving fields (ERA-40 or ERA-Interim) and the nudging technique (with or without large-scale nudging). The validation of the simulated 2-m temperature and precipitation with observationally-based gridded data sets shows that ALADIN performs similarly to other regional climate models that are commonly used over North America. Large-scale nudging improves the temporal correlation of the atmospheric circulation between ALADIN and its driving field, and also reduces the warm and dry summer biases in central North America. The differences between the simulations driven with different reanalyses are small and are likely related to the regional climate model's induced internal variability. In general, the impact of different driving fields on ALADIN is smaller than that of large-scale nudging. The analysis of the multi-year simulations over the prairie and the east taiga indicates that the ALADIN 2-m temperature and precipitation interannual variability is similar or larger than that observed. Finally, a comparison of the simulations with observations for the summer 1993 shows that ALADIN underestimates the flood in central North America mainly due to its systematic dry bias in this region. Overall, the results indicate that ALADIN can produce a valuable contribution to CORDEX over North America.},

abstract = {This study presents two simulations of the climate over Greenland with the regional climate model (RCM) HIRHAM5 at 0.05 and 0.25 resolution driven at the lateral boundaries by the ERA-Interim reanalysis for the period 1989-2009. These simulations are validated against observations from meteorological stations (Danish Meteorological Institute) at the coast and automatic weather stations on the ice sheet (Greenland Climate Network). Generally, the temperature and precipitation biases are small, indicating a realistic simulation of the climate over Greenland that is suitable to drive ice sheet models. However, the bias between the simulations and the few available observations does not reduce with higher resolution. This is partly explained by the lack of observations in regions where the higher resolution is expected to improve the simulated climate. The RCM simulations show that the temperature has increased the most in the northern part of Greenland and at lower elevations over the period 1989-2009. Higher resolution increases the relief variability in the model topography and causes the simulated precipitation to be larger on the coast and smaller over the main ice sheet compared to the lower-resolution simulation. The higher-resolution simulation likely represents the Greenlandic climate better, but the lack of observations makes it difficult to validate fully. The detailed temperature and precipitation fields that are generated with the higher resolution are recommended for producing adequate forcing fields for ice sheet models, particularly for their improved simulation of the processes occurring at the steep margins of the ice sheet.

abstract = {The arid and semi-arid areas in Central Asia have scarce water resources and fragile ecosystems that are especially sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. Reliable information regarding future projections of change in climate is crucial for long-term planning of water resources management and structural adjustment of agriculture in this region. However, the low-density meteorological observation network brings great challenges for investigating the effects of climate variations. In this study, variations of precipitation and temperature in Central Asia were examined by a combination of gridded climate dataset of the Climate Research Unit and the latest general circulation models (GCMs) under a representative concentration pathway 4.5. Three downscaling methods, Delta, Advanced Delta, and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) methods, translate the coarse GCMs to local climatic variations for the period 2021–2060 relative to 1965–2004. Major results suggested that the Advanced Delta and BMA methods outperformed the Delta method in precipitation downscaling. Projected precipitation exhibited a general increasing trend at a rate of 4.63 mm/decade for entire Central Asia with strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity. While a declining trend was observed in the southwestern and central parts of Central Asia in summer. The projected temperature was revealed an obvious ascending at 0.37°C/decade, while the warming rate accelerated in higher latitude and mountainous areas. [Correction added on 03 December 2018, after first online publication: The preceding statement has been corrected in this version.] The surface land coverage had significant effects on the variations of precipitation and temperature, respectively. The driven factors of local climate were suggested by analysing the relationships between climate variations and large-scale atmospheric circulation fields anomalies. The findings of this study aims to provide useful information to improve our understanding for future climate change and benefit local decision makers.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The fragile ecosystem, scarce water resources, and limited ecosystem resilience of Xinjiang, China make the region especially vulnerable to climate change. Researchers need reliable analyses of climate change trends to formulate regional mitigation and adaption strategies and to support sustainable development. Therefore, two statistical downscaling methods and the combination of a Mann?Kendall test with Co-Kriging interpolation were used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of climate change in Xinjiang based on the ensemble of 37 general circulation models (GCMs) in 2021?2060. The reliabilities of single run and ensemble downscaling results of GCMs were evaluated by 69 meteorological stations over the period 1965?2004. The correlation coefficients (CC) with the observations for precipitation and temperature ranged between 0.4?0.8 and 0.9?0.99 in the reference period, respectively. CC improved to 0.87 and was close to 1 after downscaling for precipitation and temperature, respectively. A pronounced increase of ca. 0.27?0.51?°C?decade?1 was projected overall, and especially for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 in northern Xinjiang. In general, the precipitation changed by ?1.66 to 6.83{\%} decade?1 while varying seasonally and spatially; a declining tendency emerged in the western regions of Xinjiang during summer. More extreme rainfall events are predicted to occur in summer and autumn months, while warmer extremes would be concentrated in August. The climate in Xinjiang will continue to become warmer and wetter. Nevertheless, Western Xinjiang will experience a warmer and drier climate in summer and autumn. These projections of climate change in the near future are able to provide useful information for the development of potential mitigation measures and adaptation strategies. Multiple circulation mechanisms are also suggested accounting for the changes in precipitation and temperature which will benefit the understanding of the possible drivers of climate variability in this region.},

abstract = {Snow conditions in high-latitude regions are changing in response to climate warming, and these changes are likely to accelerate as the warming proceeds. Here, we analyse daily gridded snow depth, temperature and precipitation data from Finland over the period 1961–2014 to discover the ongoing changes in monthly average snow depths (SN) and several snow-related indices. Our results indicate that regional differences of changes in snow conditions can be relatively large, even within such a small district as Finland. Moreover, the interannual variation of the various snow indices was found to be larger in southern Finland than in northern Finland. The largest decrease in snow depth occurred in the southern, western and central parts of Finland in late winter and early spring. This decrease was driven by increasing mixed and liquid precipitation and, especially in spring, increasing temperature. In northern Finland, the decreasing trend of snow depth was most evident in spring, but no change occurred during winter months, although the amount of solid precipitation was found to increase in December–February. In the same months, temperature and the amount of mixed and liquid precipitation increased, likely counteracting the effects of the increasing solid precipitation on snow depth. The annual maximum snow depth that typically occurs in March was found to decrease in over 85{\%} of Finland's area, most strongly in western coastal areas. In almost half of Finland's area, this decrease occurred despite increasing solid precipitation. Our findings highlight the complexity of the responses of snow conditions to climatic variability in northern Europe.},

abstract = {Abstract. The conventional climate gridded datasets based on observations only are widely used in atmospheric sciences; our focus in this paper is on climate and hydrology. On the Norwegian mainland, seNorge2 provides high-resolution fields of daily total precipitation for applications requiring long-term datasets at regional or national level, where the challenge is to simulate small-scale processes often taking place in complex terrain. The dataset constitutes a valuable meteorological input for snow and hydrological simulations; it is updated daily and presented on a high-resolution grid (1 km of grid spacing). The climate archive goes back to 1957. The spatial interpolation scheme builds upon classical methods, such as optimal interpolation and successive-correction schemes. An original approach based on (spatial) scale-separation concepts has been implemented which uses geographical coordinates and elevation as complementary information in the interpolation. seNorge2 daily precipitation fields represent local precipitation features at spatial scales of a few kilometers, depending on the station network density. In the surroundings of a station or in dense station areas, the predictions are quite accurate even for intense precipitation. For most of the grid points, the performances are comparable to or better than a state-of-the-art pan-European dataset (E-OBS), because of the higher effective resolution of seNorge2. However, in very data-sparse areas, such as in the mountainous region of southern Norway, seNorge2 underestimates precipitation because it does not make use of enough geographical information to compensate for the lack of observations. The evaluation of seNorge2 as the meteorological forcing for the seNorge snow model and the DDD (Distance Distribution Dynamics) rainfall–runoff model shows that both models have been able to make profitable use of seNorge2, partly because of the automatic calibration procedure they incorporate for precipitation. The seNorge2 dataset 1957–2015 is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.845733. Daily updates from 2015 onwards are available at http://thredds.met.no/thredds/catalog/metusers/senorge2/seNorge2/provisional{\_}archive/PREC1d/gridded{\_}dataset/catalog.html.},

abstract = {The reconstructed surface-temperature time series from boreholes in Antarctica have significantly contributed to our understanding of multidecadal and centennial temperature changes and thus provide a good way to evaluate the ability of climate models to reproduce low-frequency climate variability. However, up to now, there has not been any systematic model-data comparison based on temperature from boreholes at a regional or local scale in Antarctica. Here, we discuss two different ways to perform such a comparison using borehole measurements and the corresponding reconstructions of surface temperature at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide, Larissa, Mill Island, and Styx Glacier in Antarctica. The standard approach is to compare the surface temperature simulated by the climate model at the grid cell closest to each site with the reconstructions in the time domain derived from the borehole temperature observations. Although some characteristics of the reconstructions, for instance the nonuniform smoothing, limit to some extent the model-data comparison, several robust features can be evaluated. In addition, a more direct model-data comparison based on the temperature measured in the boreholes is conducted using a forward model that simulates explicitly the subsurface temperature profiles when driven with climate model outputs. This comparison in the depth domain is not only generally consistent with observations made in the time domain but also provides information that cannot easily be inferred from the comparison in the time domain. The major results from these comparisons are used to derive metrics that can be applied for future model-data comparison. We also describe the spatial representativity of the sites chosen for the metrics. The long-term cooling trend in West Antarctica from 1000 to 1600 CE (-1:0 °C) is generally reproduced by the models but often with a weaker amplitude. The 19th century cooling in the Antarctic Peninsula (-0:94 °C) is not reproduced by any of the models, which tend to show warming instead. The trend over the last 50 years is generally well reproduced in West Antarctica and at Larissa (Antarctic Peninsula) but overestimated at other sites. The wide range of simulated trends indicates the importance of internal variability in the observed trends and shows the value of model-data comparison to investigate the response to forcings.},

abstract = { Abstract Major prolonged droughts in Mexico during the twentieth century are mainly related to anomalous dry summers, such as those observed in the 1930s, the 1950s, or the 1990s. Droughts in northern Mexico frequently coincide with anomalously wet conditions over Mesoamerica (i.e., southern Mexico and Central America), and vice versa, displaying a dominant “seesaw” structure in persistent precipitation anomalies, mostly in relation to tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. A warmer North Atlantic Ocean, expressed as a positive phase of Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), is related to the occurrence of major droughts in North America associated with weaker-than-normal moisture flux into northern Mexico. Drought over northern Mexico may also be related to changes in transient activity in the Caribbean Sea. During the negative phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), the Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) weakens and easterly wave (EW) activity increases, leading to more tropical convection over Mesoamerica and less moisture flux into northern Mexico. On the other hand, when EW activity is weak over the intra-Americas seas (IAS) (i.e., the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea) because of a stronger-than-normal CLLJ, precipitation increases over northern Mexico. Therefore, the interaction between easterly waves and the trade winds over the IAS appears to be crucial to explain the spatial patterns of droughts that have affected Mexico. In addition, low-frequency modulators, such as AMO or PDO, may serve to explain the spatial patterns of severe prolonged droughts in Mexico during the nineteenth century. },

This is done using climate projections from a multi-model ensemble of 25 regional climate model (RCM) simulations. The RCMs take boundary conditions from ten global climate models (GCMs) under the RCP8.5 scenario. We define CDD as the maximum number of consecutive days with rainfall amount less than 1 mm and CWD as the maximum number of consecutive days with rainfall amount more than 1 mm. The differences in model representations of the change in CDD and CWD, at 1.5°C and 2°C global warming, and based on the control period 1971-2000 are reported. The models agree on a noticeable response to both 1.5°C and 2°C warming for each index. Enhanced warming results in a reduction in mean rainfall across the region. More than 80{\%} of ensemble members agree that CDD will increase over the Guinea Coast, in tandem with a projected decrease in CWD at both 1.5°C and 2°C global warming levels. These projected changes may influence already fragile ecosystems and agriculture in the region, both of which are strongly affected by mean rainfall and the length of wet and dry periods.},

abstract = {Glacier surface mass-balance measurements on Greenland started more than a century ago, but no compilation exists of the observations from the ablation area of the ice sheet and local glaciers. Such data could be used in the evaluation of modelled surface mass balance, or to document changes in glacier melt independently from model output. Here, we present a comprehensive database of Greenland glacier surface mass-balance observations from the ablation area of the ice sheet and local glaciers. The database spans the 123 a from 1892 to 2015, contains a total of {\~{}}3000 measurements from 46 sites, and is openly accessible through the PROMICE web portal ( http://www.promice.dk ). For each measurement we provide X, Y and Z coordinates, starting and ending dates as well as quality flags. We give sources for each entry and for all metadata. Two thirds of the data were collected from grey literature and unpublished archive documents. Roughly 60{\%} of the measurements were performed by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS, previously GGU). The data cover all regions of Greenland except for the southernmost part of the east coast, but also emphasize the importance of long-term time series of which there are only two exceeding 20 a. We use the data to analyse uncertainties in point measurements of surface mass balance, as well as to estimate surface mass-balance profiles for most regions of Greenland.},

abstract = {Observed trends in seasonal and annual total rainfall, number of rain days and daily maximum and minimum temperature were calculated for a number of stations in South Africa for the period 1960–2010. Statistically significant decreases in rainfall and the number of rain days are shown over the central and northeastern parts of the country in the autumn months and significant increases in the number of rain days around the southern Drakensberg are evident in spring and summer. Maximum temperatures have increased significantly throughout the country for all seasons and increases in minimum temperatures are shown for most of the country. A notable exception is the central interior, where minimum temperatures have decreased significantly. Regionally aggregated trends for six water management zones covering the entire country are not evident for total rainfall, but there are some significant trends for the number of rain days. Temperature in these zones has increased significantly for most seasons, with the exception of the central interior. Comparison of the observed trends with statistically downscaled global climate model simulations reveals that the models do not represent the observed rainfall changes nor the cooling trend of minimum temperature in the central interior. Although this result does not rule out the possibility of attributing observed local changes in rainfall to anthropogenically forced global change, it does have major implications for attribution studies. It also raises the question of whether an alternative statistical downscaling method or dynamical downscaling through the use of a regional climate model might better represent regional and local climatic processes and their links to global change.},

abstract = {Separating how model-to-model differences in the forced response ( U MD ) and internal variability ( U IV ) contribute to the uncertainty in climate projections is important, but challenging. Reducing U MD increases confidence in projections, while U IV characterises the range of possible futures that might occur purely by chance. Separating these uncertainties is limited in traditional multi-model ensembles because most models have only a small number of realisations; furthermore, some models are not independent. Here, we use six largely independent single model initial-condition large ensembles to separate the contributions of U MD and U IV in projecting 21st-century changes of temperature, precipitation, and their temporal variability under strong forcing (RCP8.5). We provide a method that produces similar results using traditional multi-model archives. While U MD is larger than U IV for both temperature and precipitation changes, U IV is larger than U MD for the changes in temporal variability of both temperature and precipitation, between 20° and 80° latitude in both hemispheres. Over large regions and for all variables considered here except temporal temperature variability, models agree on the sign of the forced response whereas they disagree widely on the magnitude. Our separation method can readily be extended to other climate variables.},

abstract = {Understanding future precipitation changes is critical for water supply and flood risk applications in the western United States. The North American COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment (NA-CORDEX) matrix of global and regional climate models at multiple resolutions ({\~{}} 50-km and 25-km grid spacings) is used to evaluate mean monthly precipitation, extreme daily precipitation, and snow water equivalent (SWE) over the western United States, with a sub-regional focus on California. Results indicate significant model spread in mean monthly precipitation in several key water-sensitive areas in both historical and future projections, but suggest model agreement on increasing daily extreme precipitation magnitudes, decreasing seasonal snowpack, and a shortening of the wet season in California in particular. While the beginning and end of the California cool season are projected to dry according to most models, the core of the cool season (December, January, February) shows an overall wetter projected change pattern. Daily cool-season precipitation extremes generally increase for most models, particularly in California in the mid-winter months. Finally, a marked projected decrease in future seasonal SWE is found across all models, accompanied by earlier dates of maximum seasonal SWE, and thus a shortening of the period of snow cover as well. Results are discussed in the context of how the diverse model membership and variable resolutions offered by the NA-CORDEX ensemble can be best leveraged by stakeholders faced with future water planning challenges.},

This paper summarizes and synthesizes results from several coordinated studies by the authors. Aspects of North American climate change that are examined include changes in continental-scale temperature and the hydrologic cycle, extremes events, and storm tracks, as well as regional manifestations of these climate variables. The authors also examine changes in the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic tropical cyclone activity and North American intraseasonal to decadal variability, including changes in teleconnections to other regions of the globe. Projected changes are generally consistent with those previously published for CMIP3, although CMIP5 model projections differ importantly from those of CMIP3 in some aspects, including CMIP5 model agreement on increased central California precipitation. The paper also highlights uncertainties and limitations based on current results as priorities for further research. Although many projected changes in North American climate are consistent across CMIP5 models, substantial intermodel disagreement exists in other aspects. Areas of disagreement include projections of changes in snow water equivalent on a regional basis, summer Arctic sea ice extent, the magnitude and sign of regional precipitation changes, extreme heat events across the northern United States, and Atlantic and east Pacific tropical cyclone activity.},

A model run forced by reanalysis data (1/2° resolution), and two runs forced by a GCM (one run with 1/2° and one run with 1/6° resolution) have been realized. The model has been evaluated regarding its ability to simulate the mean climate of the period 1971-2000. It has been found that the spatial pattern of mean temperature and precipitation is simulated well by REMO. The REMO simulations are often closer to observational data than reanalysis data are, and show considerably higher spatial detail. The GCM-forced simulations extend to the year 2100 under the A1B scenario. The climate change signal of temperature is largest in winter in the northern part of the study area and over mountainous terrain. A warming up to 7. °C is projected until the end of the 21st century. In summer, warming is strongest over the southern part of Central Asia.

abstract = {Inter-annual variability and trends of annual/seasonal precipitation totals in Ghana are analyzed considering different gridded observational (gauge- and/or satellite-based) and reanalysis products. A quality-controlled dataset formed by fourteen gauges from the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) is used as reference for the period 1961-2010. Firstly, a good agreement is found between GMet and all the observational products in terms of variability, with better results for the gauge-based products-correlations in the range of 0.7-1.0 and nearly null biases-than for the satellite-gauge merged and satellite-derived products. In contrast, reanalyses exhibit a very poor performance, with correlations below 0.4 and large biases in most of the cases. Secondly, a Mann-Kendall trend analysis is carried out. In most cases, GMet data reveal the existence of predominant decreasing (increasing) trends for the first (second) half of the period of study, 1961-1985 (1986-2010). Again, observational products are shown to reproduce well the observed trends-with worst results for purely satellite-derived data-whereas reanalyses lead in general to unrealistic stronger than observed trends, with contradictory results (opposite signs for different reanalyses) in some cases. Similar inconsistencies are also found when analyzing trends of extreme precipitation indicators. Therefore, this study provides a warning concerning the use of reanalysis data as pseudo-observations in Ghana. ? 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Instead of being selected by watershed, the cities were selected because they are part of the same arid climatic region. The data were analyzed for maximum temperature increases and the trends were confirmed statistically using Spearman's nonparametric test. Temperature trends were correlated with the mortality information related with extreme heat events in the region. The results showed a clear trend of increasing maximum temperatures during the months of June, July, and August for five of the six cities and statically confirmed using Spearman's rho values. Las Vegas was the only city where the temperature increase was not confirmed using Spearman's test, probably because it is geographically located outside of the Sonoran Desert or because of its proximity to the Hoover Dam.

abstract = {Increase in temperature extremes is one of the main expected impacts of climate change, as well as one of the first signs of its occurrence. Nevertheless, results emerging from General Circulation Models, while sufficient for large scales, are not enough for forecasting local trends and, hence, the IPCC has called for local studies based on on-site data. Indeed, it is expected that climate extremes will be detected much earlier than changes in climate averages. Heat waves are among the most important and least studied climate extremes, however its occurrence has been only barely studied and even its very definition remains controversial. This paper discusses the observed changes in temperature trends and heat waves in Northwestern Mexico, one of the most vulnerable regions of the country. The climate records in two locations of the region are analyzed, including one of the cities with extreme climate in Mexico, Mexicali City in the state of Baja California and the Yaqui River basin at Sonora State using three different methodologies. Results showed clear trends on temperature increase and occurrence of heat waves in both of the study zones using the three methodologies proposed. As result, some policy making suggestion are included in order to increase the adaptability of the studied regions to climate change, particularly related with heat wave occurrence.},

abstract = {The Caribbean is a complex region that heavily relies on its rainfall cycle for its economic and societal needs. This makes the Caribbean especially susceptible to hydro-meteorological disasters (i.e. droughts and floods). Previous studies have investigated the seasonal cycle of rainfall in the Caribbean with monthly or longer resolutions that often mask the seasonal transitions and regional differences of rainfall. This has resulted in inconsistent findings on the seasonal cycle. In addition, the mechanisms that shape the climatological rainfall cycle in the region are not fully understood. To address these problems, this study conducts: (i) a principal component analysis of the annual cycle of precipitation across 38 Caribbean stations using daily observed precipitation data; and, (ii) a moisture budget analysis for the Caribbean, using the ERA-Interim Reanalysis. This study finds that the seasonal cycle of rainfall in the Caribbean hinges on three main facilitators of moisture convergence: the Eastern Pacific ITCZ, the Atlantic ITCZ, and the western flank of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH). The Atlantic Warm Pool and Caribbean Low-Level Jet modify the extent of moisture provided by these main facilitators. The expansion and contraction of the western flank of NASH generate the bimodal pattern of the precipitation annual cycle in the northwestern Caribbean, central Caribbean, and with the Eastern Pacific ITCZ the western Caribbean. This study identifies the Atlantic ITCZ as the major source of precipitation for the central and southern Lesser Antilles, which is responsible for their unimodal rainfall pattern. Convergence by sub-monthly transients contributes little to Caribbean rainfall.},

abstract = {Abstract. This study focuses on an assessment of the future snow depth for two larger Alpine catchments. Automatic weather station data from two diverse regions in the Swiss Alps have been used as input for the Alpine3D surface process model to compute the snow cover at a 200 m horizontal resolution for the reference period (1999–2012). Future temperature and precipitation changes have been computed from 20 downscaled GCM-RCM chains for three different emission scenarios, including one intervention scenario (2 °C target) and for three future time periods (2020–2049, 2045–2074, 2070–2099). By applying simple daily change values to measured time series of temperature and precipitation, small-scale climate scenarios have been calculated for the median estimate and extreme changes. The projections reveal a decrease in snow depth for all elevations, time periods and emission scenarios. The non-intervention scenarios demonstrate a decrease of about 50 {\%} even for elevations above 3000 m. The most affected elevation zone for climate change is located below 1200 m, where the simulations show almost no snow towards the end of the century. Depending on the emission scenario and elevation zone the winter season starts half a month to 1 month later and ends 1 to 3 months earlier in this last scenario period. The resulting snow cover changes may be roughly equivalent to an elevation shift of 500–800 or 700–1000 m for the two non-intervention emission scenarios. At the end of the century the number of snow days may be more than halved at an elevation of around 1500 m and only 0–2 snow days are predicted in the lowlands. The results for the intervention scenario reveal no differences for the first scenario period but clearly demonstrate a stabilization thereafter, comprising much lower snow cover reductions towards the end of the century (ca. 30 {\%} instead of 70 {\%}).},

The model reproduces satisfactorily the near-surface temperature and precipitation characteristics over most part of North America. Coastal and mountainous zones remain problematic: a cold bias (2–6 C) prevails over Rocky Mountains in summertime and all year-round over Mexico; winter precipitation in mountainous coastal regions is overestimated. The precipitation patterns related to the North American Monsoon are well reproduced, except on its northern limit. The spatial and temporal structure of the Great Plains Low-Level Jet is well reproduced by the model; however, the night-time precipitation maximum in the jet area is underestimated. The performance of CRCM5 was assessed against earlier CRCM versions and other RCMs. CRCM5 is shown to have been substantially improved compared to CRCM3 and CRCM4 in terms of seasonal mean statistics, and to be comparable to other modern RCMs.},

abstract = {In the Arctic, climate change manifests with the strongest warming trends on the globe, especially in the cold season. It is under debate if climate extremes change similarly strong. Our study provides detailed regional information about two selected temperature extreme indices in the Arctic, namely warm and cold spells in winter and summer. We analyze their temporal evolution and variability from 1979–2013, based on daily station data and ERA-Interim reanalysis. Calculated trends from both datasets suggest a widespread decrease of cold spells in winter and summer of up to −4 days/decade, with regional patches where trends are statistically significant throughout the Arctic. Winter trends are spatially heterogeneous, the reanalysis also shows small areas with statistically significant increases of cold spells throughout Siberia. Calculated changes in warm spells from both datasets are mostly small throughout the Arctic (less than ±1 day/decade) and statistically not significant. Remarkable exceptions are the Lena river basin in winter with a statistically significant decrease of up to −1.5 days/decade and areas in Scandinavia with statistically significant increases of up to 2.5 days/decade in winter and summer (again from both datasets). From the analysis of spell lengths, we find that there are no shifts from longer to shorter spells or vice versa with time, but long cold spells (events lasting for more than 15 days) disappear almost completely after the year 2000. There is a distinct inter-annual and decadal variability in the spells, which hinders the detection of significant trends for all spell categories in all regions.},

abstract = {High-resolution data are needed in order to assess potential impacts of extreme events on infrastructure in the mid-latitudes. Dynamical downscaling offers one way to obtain this information. However, prior to implementation in any impacts assessment scheme, model output must be validated and determined fitfor-purpose. This study presents the results from two 8-km resolution perfect boundary experiments over Scandinavia. Two different regional climate models were initialised and driven with ERA interim reanalysis from 1990 to 2010. Reference data come from both gridded products and point-based station observations. In addition to the canonical variables of daily precipitation and temperature, winds were also investigated. The models exhibit systematic cold and wet biases on seasonal time scales (−1 K and +50–100{\%}, respectively). However, frequency-based skill scores for daily precipitation and temperature are high, indicating that the distributions of these variables are generally well captured. Wind speeds over the North and Norwegian Seas were simulated more realistically in the models than in the ERA interim reanalysis. However, most importantly, for impacts assessments, the models should be capable of capturing the timing, intensity and location of short-duration extreme events, in particular precipitation. In this respect, both models outperform the reanalysis over the city of Copenhagen, where recent pluvial floods led to costly damages to infrastructure.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd. Discriminating climate impacts between 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming levels is particularly important for Central Africa, a vulnerable region where multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interact to constrain the region's adaptive capacity. This study uses an ensemble of 25 transient Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations from the CORDEX initiative, forced with the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, to investigate the potential temperature and precipitation changes in Central Africa corresponding to 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming levels. Global climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) are used to drive the RCMs and determine timing of the targeted global warming levels. The regional warming differs over Central Africa between 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming levels. Whilst there are large uncertainties associated with projections at 1.5 °C and 2 °C, the 0.5 °C increase in global temperature is associated with larger regional warming response. Compared to changes in temperature, changes in precipitation are more heterogeneous and climate model simulations indicate a lack of consensus across the region, though there is a tendency towards decreasing seasonal precipitation in March-May, and a reduction of consecutive wet days. As a drought indicator, a significant increase in consecutive dry days was found. Consistent changes of maximum 5 day rainfall are also detected between 1.5 °C vs. 2 °C global warming levels.},

abstract = {This study evaluates snow water equivalent (SWE) over North America in the reanalysis-driven NARCCAP regional climate model (RCM) experiments. Examination of SWE in these runs allows for the identification of bias due to RCM configuration, separate from inherited GCM bias. SWE from the models is compared to SWE from a new ensemble observational product to evaluate the RCMs' ability to capture the magnitude, spatial distribution, duration, and timing of the snow season. This new dataset includes data from 14 different sources in five different types. Consideration of the associated uncertainty in observed SWE strongly influences the appearance of bias in RCM-generated SWE. Of the six NARCCAP RCMs, the version of MM5 run by Iowa State University (MM5I) is found to best represent SWE despite its use of the Noah land surface model. CRCM overestimates SWE because of cold temperature biases and surface temperature parameterization options, while RegCM3 (RCM3) does so because of excessive precipitation. HadRM3 (HRM3) underestimates SWE because of warm temperature biases, while in the version of WRF using the Grell scheme (WRFG) and ECPC-RSM (ECP2), the misrepresentation of snow in the Noah land surface model plays the dominant role in SWE bias, particularly in ECP2 where sublimation is too high.},

abstract = {The NARCCAP RCM–GCM ensemble is used to explore the uncertainty in midcentury projections of snow over North America that arise when multiple RCMs are used to downscale multiple GCMs. Various snow metrics are examined, including snow water equivalent (SWE), snow cover extent (SCE), snow cover duration (SCD), and the timing of the snow season. Simulated biases in baseline snow characteristics are found to be sensitive to the choice of RCM and less influenced by the driving GCM. By midcentury, domain-averaged SCE and SWE are projected to decrease in all months of the year. However, using multiple RCMs to downscale multiple GCMs inflates the uncertainty in future projections of both SCE and SWE, with projections of SWE being more uncertain. Spatially, the RCMs show winter SWE decreasing over most of North America, except north of the Arctic rim, where SWE is projected to increase. SCD is also projected to decrease with both a later start and earlier termination of the snow season. For all metrics considered, the magnitude of the climate change signal varies across the RCMs. The ensemble spread is large over the western United States, where the RCMs disagree on the sign of the change in SWE in some high-elevation regions. Future projections of snow (both magnitude and spatial patterns) are more similar between simulations performed with the same RCM than the simulations driven by the same GCM. This implies that climate change uncertainty is not sufficiently explored in experiments performed with a single RCM driven by multiple GCMs.},

abstract = {The Aral Sea was formerly one of the world's largest lakes and supported critical ecosystem services, fisheries, and major shipping routes. It was also situated in a rapidly industrializing agricultural region and, as such, multiple anthropogenic forcings have modified the Aral's regional environmental conditions over the latter 20th century. In particular, rising atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations coupled with intensive water resource use have had significant regional climate impacts. Sustained abstractions from regional rivers as an irrigation resource for intensified agricultural production has led to the rapid desiccation of the Aral Sea. As of summer 2014, only 10{\%} of its historic extent remained. This paper reports modeling experiments to elucidate the climatic changes resulting from both increased GHG concentrations and an idealized disappearance of the Aral Sea. We utilized the MIT Regional Climate Model to perform 30-year experiments of pre-desiccated and fully desiccated Aral Sea conditions under moderate and enhanced GHG forcings. Complete desiccation combined with the GHG forcings resulted in substantial increases in summertime net longwave radiation, sensible heating, and surface temperature. Additionally, large reductions in evapotranspiration altered the regional soil moisture − surface temperature relationship. Furthermore, a completely desiccated Aral Sea heightened the GHG-induced regional warming. These results demonstrate how a total loss of the Aral Sea might exacerbate regional climate change. At the same time, they suggest that some of the regional warming and moisture regime shifts could be alleviated with the Aral Sea's restoration, requiring the implementation of conservation practices and improved regional water governance.},

Here we show for a marginal alpine region of Australia using a carbon isotope speleothem reconstruction, warming over the past five decades has experienced equivalent magnitude of temperature change and snow cover decline to the RWP and MCA. The current rate of warming is unmatched for the past 2000 years and seasonal snow cover is at a minimum. On scales of several decades, mean maximum temperatures have undergone considerable change ≈ ± 0.8 °C highlighting local scale susceptibility to rapid temperature change, evidence of which is often masked in regional to hemisphere scale temperature reconstructions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Rainfall records for 23 countries and territories in the western Pacific have been collated for the purpose of examining trends in total and extreme rainfall since 1951. For some countries this is the first time that their data have been included in this type of analysis and for others the number of stations examined is more than twice that available in the current literature. Station trends in annual total and extreme rainfall for 1961–2011 are spatially heterogeneous and largely not statistically significant. This differs with the results of earlier studies that show spatially coherent trends that tended to reverse in the vicinity of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). We infer that the difference is due to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation switching to a negative phase from about 1999, largely reversing earlier rainfall changes. Trend analyses for 1981–2011 show wetter conditions in the West Pacific Monsoon (WPM) region and southwest of the mean SPCZ position. In the tropical North Pacific it has become wetter west of 160°E with the Intertropical Convergence Zone/WPM expanding northwards west of 140°E. Northeast of the SPCZ and in the central tropical Pacific east of about 160°E it has become drier. Our findings for the South Pacific subtropics are consistent with broader trends seen in parts of southern and eastern Australia towards reduced rainfall. The relationship between total and extreme rainfall and Pacific basin sea surface temperatures (SSTs) has been investigated with a focus on the influence of the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We substantiate a strong relationship between ENSO and total rainfall and establish similar relationships for the threshold extreme indices. The percentile-based and absolute extreme indices are influenced by ENSO to a lesser extent and in some cases the influence is marginal. Undoubtedly, larger-scale SST variability is not the only influence on these indices.},

abstract = {AbstractTrends in mean and extreme annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation over the 1951?2015 period were calculated for 57 stations in 20 western Pacific Ocean island countries and territories. The extremes indices are those of the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Sector-Specific Climate Indices. The purpose of the expert team and indices is to promote the use of globally consistent climate indices to highlight variability and trends in climate extremes that are of particular interest to socioeconomic sectors and to help to characterize the climate sensitivity of various sectors. Prior to the calculation of the monthly means and indices, the data underwent quality control and homogeneity assessment. A rise in mean temperature occurred at most stations, in all seasons, and in both halves of the study period. The temperature indices also showed strong warming, which for the majority was strongest in December?February and weakest in June?August. The absolute and percentile-based indices show the greatest warming at the upper end of the distribution. While changes in precipitation were less consistent and trends were generally weak at most locations, declines in both total and extreme precipitation were found in southwestern French Polynesia and the southern subtropics. There was a decrease in moderate- to high-intensity precipitation events, especially those experienced over multiple days, in southwestern French Polynesia from December to February. Strong drying trends have also been identified in the low- to moderate-extreme indices in the June?August and September?November periods. These negative trends contributed to an increase in the magnitude of meteorological drought in both subregions.},

abstract = {Based on a revised and extended multi-station Hawaiʻi Temperature Index (HTI), the mean air temperature in the Hawaiian Islands has warmed significantly at 0.052°C/decade (p {\textless} 0.01) over the past 100 years (1917–2016). The year 2016 was the warmest year on record at 0.924°C above the 100-year mean (0.202°C). During each of the last four decades, mean state-wide positive air temperature anomalies were greater than those of any of the previous decades. Significant warming trends for the last 100 years are evident at low- (0.056°C/decade, p {\textless} 0.001) and high-elevations (0.047°C/decade, p {\textless} 0.01). Warming in Hawai‘i is largely attributed to significant increases in minimum temperature (0.072°C/decade, p {\textless} 0.001) resulting in a corresponding downward trend in diurnal temperature range (−0.055°C/decade, p {\textless} 0.001) over the 100-year period. Significant positive correlations were found between HTI, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Multivariate ENSO Index, indicating that natural climate variability has a significant impact on temperature in Hawaiʻi. Analysis of surface air temperatures from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for the region of Hawaiʻi over the last 69 years (1948–2016) and a mean atmospheric layer temperature time series calculated from radiosonde-measured thickness (distance between constant pressure surfaces) data over the last 40 years (1977–2016) give results consistent with the HTI. Finally, we compare temperature trends for Hawaii's highest elevation station, Mauna Loa Observatory (3,397 m), to those on another mountainous subtropical island station in the Atlantic, Mt. Iza{\~{n}}a Observatory (2,373 m), Tenerife, Canary Islands. Both stations sit above the local temperature inversion layer and have virtually identical significant warming trends of 0.19°C/decade (p {\textless} 0.001) between 1955 and 2016.},

abstract = {End-of-century changes in Caribbean climate extremes are derived from the Providing Regional Climate for Impact Studies (PRECIS) regional climate model (RCM) under the A2 and B2 emission scenarios across five rainfall zones. Trends in rainfall, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature extremes from the RCM are validated against meteorological stations over 1979–1989. The model displays greater skill at representing trends in consecutive wet days (CWD) and extreme rainfall (R95P) than consecutive dry days (CDD), wet days (R10), and maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5). Trends in warm nights, cool days, and warm days were generally well reproduced. Projections for 2071–2099 relative to 1961–1989 are obtained from the ECHAM5 driven RCM. Northern and eastern zones are projected to experience more intense rainfall under A2 and B2. There is less consensus across scenarios with respect to changes in the dry and wet spell lengths. However, there is indication that a drying trend may be manifest over zone 5 (Trinidad and northern Guyana). Changes in the extreme temperature indices generally suggest a warmer Caribbean towards the end of century across both scenarios with the strongest changes over zone 4 (eastern Caribbean).},

abstract = {In many studies that use data from Coupled Model Inter-comparisons Project Five (CMIP5) the large number of models included prohibits the use of data from all models. Studies based on small subsets of CMIP5 may therefore exclude a significant fraction of the plausible range of future climate changes. In the Inter-sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project (ISI-MIP), a subset of five CMIP5 models is used in global climate impact studies. We find that the fraction of the full range of future projections captured across different regions and seasons by the ISI-MIP subset varies from 0.5 to 0.9 for temperature (median 0.75) and 0.3 to 0.8 for precipitation (median 0.55). The implication of this is that for many regions and seasons, this subset can be expected to underestimate both the total uncertainty in future climate impact, and the proportion of total uncertainty that is attributable to the use of different GCMs. The fraction of climate model uncertainty sampled could be improved only marginally by using a strategically selected global optimal subset of 5. In order to capture {\textgreater} 0.8 (0.9) of the range in {\textgreater}75{\%} or more of regions and seasons, at least 13 (20) models would be required. However, the use of regionally optimised subsets could significantly improve the range of regional precipitation changes captured by a subset of restricted size. The results of impact studies based on subsets of CMIP5 could be presented alongside information about how well the subset captures uncertainties in future climate to aid interpretation of impact uncertainty ranges.},

abstract = {Changes in accumulated snowfall over the Antarctic Ice Sheet have an immediate and time-delayed impact on global mean sea level. The immediate impact is due to the instantaneous change in freshwater storage over the ice sheet, whereas the time-delayed impact acts in opposition through enhanced ice-dynamic flux into the ocean 1 . Here, we reconstruct 200 years of Antarctic-wide snow accumulation by synthesizing a newly compiled database of ice core records 2 using reanalysis-derived spatial coherence patterns. The results reveal that increased snow accumulation mitigated twentieth-century sea-level rise by {\~{}}10 mm since 1901, with rates increasing from 1.1 mm decade −1 between 1901 and 2000 to 2.5 mm decade −1 after 1979. Reconstructed accumulation trends are highly variable in both sign and magnitude at the regional scale, and linked to the trend towards a positive Southern Annular Mode since 1957 3 . Because the observed Southern Annular Mode trend is accompanied by a decrease in Antarctic Ice Sheet accumulation, changes in the strength and location of the circumpolar westerlies cannot explain the reconstructed increase, which may instead be related to stratospheric ozone depletion 4 . However, our results indicate that a warming atmosphere cannot be excluded as a dominant force in the underlying increase.},

abstract = {A 1360-yr control run from a global coupled climate model (the Parallel Climate Model) is analyzed. It simulates “megadroughts” in the southwestern United States and Indian monsoon regions. The megadroughts represent extreme events of naturally occurring multidecadal precipitation variations linked to the dominant pattern of multidecadal SST variability in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Gaining insight into the occurrence of megadroughts thus requires an understanding of the mechanism that is producing this multidecadal SST variability. Analysis of the model variability shows that the mechanism involves atmosphere–ocean and tropical–midlatitude interactions, with a crucial element being wind-forced ocean Rossby waves near 20°N and 25°S in the Pacific whose transit times set the decadal time scale. At the western boundary, the Rossby waves reflect into the equatorial Pacific to affect thermocline depth. The resulting feedbacks, involving surface temperature, winds, and the strength of the subtropical cells, produce SST anomalies and associated precipitation and convective heating anomalies. These anomalies are associated with atmospheric Rossby waves and resulting anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns in the midlatitude North and South Pacific. Consequent surface wind stress anomalies extend equatorward into the Tropics and help force ocean Rossby waves near 20°N and 25°S, and so on. Though there are some common elements with various ENSO processes, this decadal mechanism is physically distinct mainly because the surface wind stress anomalies near 20°N and 25°S supplement the wave reflections at the eastern boundary to force the ocean Rossby waves that provide the decadal time scale. These wind anomalies are closely tied to the anomalous midlatitude atmospheric circulation that is a product of teleconnections from the multidecadal SST and tropical convective heating anomalies, themselves linked to precipitation anomalies in the southwestern United States and south Asia associated with megadroughts.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes a suite of global climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archives to understand the mechanisms behind a net increase in the South Asian summer monsoon precipitation in response to enhanced radiative forcing during the twenty-first century. An increase in radiative forcing fuels an increase in the atmospheric moisture content through warmer temperatures, which overwhelms the weakening of monsoon circulation and results in an increase of moisture convergence and therefore summer monsoon precipitation over South Asia. Moisture source analysis suggests that both regional (local recycling, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal) and remote (including the south Indian Ocean) sources contribute to the moisture supply for precipitation over South Asia during the summer season that is facilitated by the monsoon dynamics. For regional moisture sources, the effect of excessive atmospheric moisture is offset by weaker monsoon circulation and uncertainty in the response of the evapotranspiration over land, so anomalies in their contribution to the total moisture supply are either mixed or muted. In contrast, weakening of the monsoon dynamics has less influence on the moisture supply from remote sources that not only is a dominant moisture contributor in the historical period but is also the net driver of the positive summer monsoon precipitation response in the twenty-first century. The results also indicate that historic measures of the monsoon dynamics may not be well suited to predict the nonstationary moisture-driven South Asian summer monsoon precipitation response in the twenty-first century.},

The reproducibility of the statistical characteristics of the anomalies was also considered using ensemble simulations with the MGO atmospheric general circulation model and prescribed boundary conditions from observation for the period 1979–2017.

abstract = {This study evaluates the capability of regional climate models (RCMs) in simulating the link between El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern African droughts. It uses the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI, computed using rainfall and temperature data) to identify 3-month drought over Southern Africa, and compares the observed and simulated correlation between ENSO and SPEI. The observation data are from the Climate Research Unit, while the simulation data are from ten RCMs (ARPEGE, CCLM, HIRHAM, RACMO, REMO, PRECIS, RegCM3, RCA, WRF, and CRCM) that participated in the regional climate downscaling experiment (CORDEX) project. The study analysed the rainy season (December–February) data for 19 years (1989–2008). The results show a strong link between ENSO and droughts (SPEI) over Southern Africa. The link is owing to the influence of ENSO on both rainfall and temperature fields, but the correlation between ENSO and temperature is stronger than the correlation between ENSO and rainfall. Hence, using only rainfall to monitor droughts in Southern Africa may underestimate the influence of ENSO on the droughts. Only few CORDEX RCMs simulate the influence of ENSO on Southern African drought as observed. In this regard, the ARPEGE model shows the best simulation, while CRCM shows the worst. The different in the performance may be due to their lateral boundary conditions. The RCA-simulated link between ENSO and Southern African droughts is sensitive to the global dataset used as the lateral boundary conditions. In some cases, using RCA to downscale global circulation models (GCM) simulations adds value to the simulated link between ENSO and the droughts, but in other cases the downscaling adds no value to the link. The added value of RCA to the simulated link decreases as the capability of the GCM to simulate the link increases. This study suggests that downscaling GCM simulations with RCMs over Southern Africa may improve or depreciate the simulated ENSO-drought link over the region. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Assessing the performance of climate models in surface air temperature (SAT) simulation and projection have received increasing attention during the recent decades. This paper assesses the performance of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) in simulating intra-annual, annual and decadal temperature over Northern Eurasia from 1901 to 2005. We evaluate the skill of different multi-model ensemble techniques and use the best technique to project the future SAT changes under different emission scenarios. The results show that most of the general circulation models (GCMs) overestimate the annual mean SAT in Northern Eurasia and the difference between the observation and the simulations primarily comes from the winter season. Most of the GCMs can approximately capture the decadal SAT trend; however, the accuracy of annual SAT simulation is relatively low. The correlation coefficient R between each GCM simulation and the annual observation is in the range of 0.20 to 0.56. The Taylor diagram shows that the ensemble results generated by the simple model averaging (SMA), reliability ensemble averaging (REA) and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) methods are superior to any single GCM output; and the decadal SAT change generated by SMA, REA and BMA are almost identical during 1901-2005. Heuristically, the uncertainty of BMA simulation is the smallest among the three multi-model ensemble simulations. The future SAT projection generated by the BMA shows that the SAT in Northern Eurasia will increase in the 21st century by around 1.03 °C/100 yr, 3.11 °C/100 yr and 7.14 °C/100 yr under the RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively; and the warming accelerates with the increasing latitude. In addition, the spring season contributes most to the decadal warming occurring under the RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 scenarios, while the winter season contributes most to the decadal warming occurring under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Generally, the uncertainty of the SAT projections increases with time in the 21st century.},

abstract = {Abstract Observational studies indicated that the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) showed significant decadal variations and experienced an interdecadal weakening in the mid-1980s. How did the EAWM evolve thereafter? In this study, we investigate the decadal variations of the EAWM in the past three decades using five reanalysis datasets and one observational dataset. In total, five members of EAWM system are examined. In the lower troposphere, the Siberian high intensity becomes stronger around 2005 in all five reanalysis datasets, whereas the Aleutian low strengthens in the mid-1990s and weakens in the mid-2000s. The two subsystems show opposing changes in the past two decades. In the middle troposphere, the intensity of the East Asian trough remains weakening in recent decades only with some short-time strengthening around the years of 1995 and 2010. In the upper troposphere, the EAWM index based on the meridional shear of the East Asian jet stream at the 300-hPa level shows a weak positive trend since the 1990s. It has decadal variations similar to those of the East Asian trough. In the context of these members' changes, the low-level northerly wind index exhibits two cycles since the year 1980. This index increases in the mid-1980s, then decreases since the mid-1990s, and finally increases in the mid-2000s. Further analysis on the East Asian surface air temperature also reflects similar decadal variations. In summary, unlike the interdecadal shift in the mid-1980s, the EAWM members (i.e., the Siberian high, the Aleutian low, the low-level northwesterly wind, the East Asian trough and the East Asian jet stream) do not show consistent decadal variations over the past 30?years. The low-level members show more significant changes.},

It is found that the surface air temperature increases over the Asian continent and Pacific, and the precipitation increases over the northern Asian continent in winter during the 1.5 and 2.0GW periods. For the 1.5GW period, large uncertainties can be found in the projection of EAWM system members (i.e., Siberian high, Aleutian low, low-level winds over eastern Asia, East Asian trough [EAT] and East Asian jet stream [EAJS]). For the 2.0GW period, more than two-thirds of the models show that the Siberian high, the EAT and the meridional shear of the EAJS are weakened, but the Aleutian low is intensified. In addition, the intensified Aleutian low enhances low-level northwesterly wind along the coast of northeastern Asia. Compared to those in the 1.5GW period, the EAWM system members show more robust changes during the 2.0GW period, except for the low-level winds at mid-latitude eastern Asia. These conclusions are suitable for both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.},

abstract = {As evidence of climate change strengthens, knowledge of its regional implications becomes an urgent need for decision making. Current understanding of regional precipitation changes is substantially limited by our understanding of the atmospheric circulation response to climate change, which to a high degree remains uncertain. This uncertainty is reflected in the wide spread in atmospheric circulation changes projected in multimodel ensembles, which cannot be directly interpreted in a probabilistic sense. The uncertainty can instead be represented by studying a discrete set of physically plausible storylines of atmospheric circulation changes. By mining CMIP5 model output, here we take this broader perspective and develop storylines for Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitude circulation changes, conditioned on the degree of global-mean warming, based on the climate responses of two remote drivers: the enhanced warming of the tropical upper troposphere and the strengthening of the stratospheric polar vortex. For the three continental domains in the SH, we analyse the precipitation changes under each storyline. To allow comparison with previous studies, we also link both circulation and precipitation changes with those of the Southern Annular Mode. Our results show that the response to tropical warming leads to a strengthening of the midlatitude westerly winds, whilst the response to a delayed breakdown (for DJF) or strengthening (for JJA) of the stratospheric vortex leads to a poleward shift of the westerly winds and the storm tracks. However, the circulation response is not zonally symmetric and the regional precipitation storylines for South America, South Africa, South of Australia and New Zealand exhibit quite specific dependencies on the two remote drivers, which are not well represented by changes in the Southern Annular Mode.},

abstract = {Abstract In the region of Earth most sensitive to climate change, spring snowmelt serves as a measurable indicator of climate change and plays a strong role in the feedbacks that amplify Arctic warming. We characterize the melt season and attribute melt onset in a region of northern Canada during the spring snowmelt season from 2003 to 2011. Melt onset dates are obtained from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System retrievals. Energy balance and meteorological fields are obtained from NASA's Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications product. Analysis of three distinct subregions demonstrates that typical values of energy balance terms vary across the region and have different roles in melt attribution. Melt is controlled more by advective energy farther southwest where melt onset begins sooner, compared to higher levels of radiative energy over the tundra. This study demonstrates that a relatively small region can exhibit large differences in controls on spring snowmelt both within the region and interannually, and these differences can be understood in the context of factors ranging from the large-scale synoptic pattern to land cover and the local energy balance. Being able to attribute melt onset to those drivers that are changing as the high latitudes warm as opposed to those that do not (i.e., insolation) allows better long-term prediction of melt season dynamics and the climatological processes influenced by snow cover and its feedbacks.},

abstract = {Spring snowmelt onset has occurred earlier across much of the Northern Hemisphere land area in the last four decades. Understanding the mechanisms driving spring melt has remained a challenge, particularly in its spatial and temporal variability. Here, melt onset dates (MOD) obtained from passive microwave satellite data are used, as well as energy balance and meteorological fields from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, to assess trends in the MOD and attribute melt onset across much of Arctic and sub-Arctic Eurasia and North America during the spring snowmelt season from 1979 to 2012. Across much of the Northern Hemisphere MOD has occurred 1–2 weeks earlier over this period, with the strongest trends in western and central Russia and insignificant trends across most of North America. Trends in MOD are reflected by those in energy balance terms, with energy advection providing an increasing proportion of melt energy in regions with the strongest MOD trends. Energy advection plays a larger role in melt onset in regions where snow begins melting in March and April, while insolation and longwave radiation drives melt where the MOD occurs in May and June. This implies that there is a potential shift in snowmelt drivers toward those involved in advective processes rather than radiative processes with an earlier MOD. As the high latitudes warm and terrestrial snow cover continues to melt and disappear earlier in the spring, it is valuable to elucidate regional snowmelt sensitivities to better understand regional responses to changing climatological processes.},

To that end, we derive a new 9-year long dataset (2009–17) of accumulation rates in Southeast Greenland using NASA Operation IceBridge snow radar. Our accumulation dataset derived from internal layers focuses on high elevations (1500–3000 m) because at lower elevations meltwater percolation obscured internal layer structure. The uncertainty of the radar-derived accumulation rates is 11{\%} [using Firn Densification Model (FDM) density profiles] and the average accumulation rate ranges from 0.5 to 1.2 m w.e. With our observations spanning almost a decade, we find large inter-annual variability, but no significant trend. Accumulation rates are compared with output from two regional climate models (RCMs), MAR and RACMO2. This comparison shows that the models are underestimating accumulation in Southeast Greenland and the models misrepresent spatial heterogeneity due to an orographically forced bias in snowfall near the coast. Our dataset is useful to fill in temporal and spatial data gaps, and to evaluate RCMs where few in situ measurements are available.},

abstract = {Since the early or late arrival of monsoon rainfall can be devastating to agriculture and economy, the prediction of the onset of monsoon is a very important issue. The Asian monsoon is characterized by a strong annual cycle with rainy summer and dry winter. Nevertheless, most of monsoon studies have focused on the seasonal-mean of temperature and precipitation. The present study aims to evaluate a total of 27 coupled models that participated in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) for projection of the time evolution and the intensity of Asian monsoon on the basis of the annual cycle of temperature and precipitation. And future changes of onset, retreat, and intensity of monsoon are analyzed. Four models for good seasonal-mean (GSM) and good harmonic (GH) groups, respectively, are selected. GSM is based on the seasonal-mean of temperature and precipitation in summer and winter, and GH is based on the annual cycle of temperature and precipitation which represents a characteristic of the monsoon. To compare how well the time evolution of the monsoon is simulated in each group, the onset, retreat, and duration of Asian monsoon are examined. The highest pattern correlation coefficient (PCC) of onset, retreat, and duration between the reanalysis data and model outputs demonstrates that GH models' MME predicts time evolution of monsoon most precisely, with PCC values of 0.80, 0.52, and 0.63, respectively. To predict future changes of the monsoon, the representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP 4.5) experiments for the period of 2073-2099 are compared with historical simulations for the period of 1979-2005 from CMIP5 using GH models' MME. The Asian monsoon domain is expanded by 22.6{\%} in the future projection. The onset date in the future is advanced over most parts of Asian monsoon region. The duration of summer Asian monsoon in the future projection will be lengthened by up to 2 pentads over the Asian monsoon region, as a result of advanced onset. The Asian monsoon intensity becomes stronger with the passage of time. This study has important implication for assessment of CMIP5 models in terms of the prediction of time evolution and intensity of Asian monsoon based on the annual cycle of temperature and precipitation.},

Using 1860 to 2005 as the historical period, this index has a global mean of 2069 (±18 years s.d.) for near-surface air temperature under an emissions stabilization scenario and 2047 (±14 years s.d.) under a 'business-as-usual' scenario.

This article reflects upon the key requirements, guiding principles, and design decisions that influenced the prov family of documents. A broad range of requirements were found, relating to the key concepts necessary for describing provenance, such as resources, activities, agents and events, and to balancing prov's ease of use with the facility to check its validity. By this retrospective requirement analysis, the article aims to provide some insights into how prov turned out as it did and why.

abstract = {Nine gridded Northern Hemisphere snow water equivalent (SWE) products were evaluated as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Satellite Snow Product Intercomparison and Evaluation Exercise (SnowPEx). Three categories of datasets were assessed: (1) those utilizing some form of reanalysis (the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System version 2 - GLDAS-2; the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim land surface reanalysis - ERA-Interim/Land and ERA5; the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 1 (MERRA) and version 2 (MERRA-2); the Crocus snow model driven by ERA-Interim meteorology - Crocus); (2) passive microwave remote sensing combined with daily surface snow depth observations (ESA GlobSnow v2.0); and (3) stand-alone passive microwave retrievals (NASA AMSR-E SWE versions 1.0 and 2.0) which do not utilize surface snow observations. Evaluation included validation against independent snow course measurements from Russia, Finland, and Canada and product intercomparison through the calculation of spatial and temporal correlations in SWE anomalies. The stand-alone passive microwave SWE products (AMSR-E v1.0 and v2.0 SWE) exhibit low spatial and temporal correlations to other products and RMSE nearly double the best performing product. Constraining passive microwave retrievals with surface observations (GlobSnow) provides performance comparable to the reanalysis-based products; RMSE over Finland and Russia for all but the AMSR-E products is ĝ{\&}circ;1/450 mm or less, with the exception of ERA-Interim/Land over Russia. Using a seven-dataset ensemble that excluded the stand-alone passive microwave products reduced the RMSE by 10 mm (20 {\%}) and increased the correlation from 0.67 to 0.78 compared to any individual product. The overall performance of the best multiproduct combinations is still at the margins of acceptable uncertainty for scientific and operational requirements; only through combined and integrated improvements in remote sensing, modeling, and observations will real progress in SWE product development be achieved.},

abstract = {Mountain snowpack stores a significant quantity of water in the western US, accumulating during the wet season and melting during the dry summers and supplying much of the water used for irrigated agriculture, and municipal and industrial uses. Updating our earlier work published in 2005, we find that with 14 additional years of data, over 90{\%} of snow monitoring sites with long records across the western US now show declines, of which 33{\%} are significant (vs. 5{\%} expected by chance) and 2{\%} are significant and positive (vs. 5{\%} expected by chance). Declining trends are observed across all months, states, and climates, but are largest in spring, in the Pacific states, and in locations with mild winter climate. We corroborate and extend these observations using a gridded hydrology model, which also allows a robust estimate of total western snowpack and its decline. We find a large increase in the fraction of locations that posted decreasing trends, and averaged across the western US, the decline in average April 1 snow water equivalent since mid-century is roughly 15–30{\%} or 25–50 km3, comparable in volume to the West's largest man-made reservoir, Lake Mead.},

Over 80{\%} of measurement sites west of 115°W experienced record low snowpack in 2015, and we estimate a return period of 400–1000 years for California's snowpack under the questionable assumption of stationarity. Hydrologic modeling supports the conclusion that 2015 was the most severe on record by a wide margin. Using a crowd-sourced superensemble of regional climate model simulations, we show that both human influence and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies contributed strongly to the risk of snow drought in Oregon and Washington: the contribution of SST anomalies was about twice that of human influence. By contrast, SSTs and humans appear to have played a smaller role in creating California's snow drought. In all three states, the anthropogenic effect on temperature exacerbated the snow drought.},

abstract = {Abstract. HARMONIE-AROME is a convection-permitting non-hydrostatic model that includes the multi-purpose SURFEX surface model. It is developed for high resolution (1–3 km) weather forecasting and applied in a number of regions in Europe and the Mediterranean. A version of HARMONIE-AROME is also under development for regional climate modelling. Here we run HARMONIE-AROME for a domain over Greenland that includes a significant portion of the Greenland ice sheet. The model output reproduces temperature, wind speed and direction and relative humidity over the ice sheet well when compared with the observations from PROMICE automatic weather stations (AWS) operated within the model domain on the ice sheet (mean temperature bias 1.31 ± 3.6 K) but we identified a much lower bias (−0.16 ± 2.3 K) at PROMICE sites on days where melt does not occur at the ice sheet surface and is thus an artefact of the simplified surface scheme over glaciers in the existing HARMONIE-AROME operational set-up. The bias in summer time temperature also affects wind speed and direction as the dominant katabatic winds are caused by the cold ice surface and slope gradient. By setting an upper threshold to the surface temperature of the ice surface within SURFEX we show that the weather forecast error over the Greenland ice sheet can be reduced in summer when glacier ice is exposed. This improvement will facilitate accurate ice melt and run-off computations, important both for ice surface mass budget estimation and for commercial applications such as hydro-power forecasting. Furthermore, the HCLIM regional climate model derived from HARMONIE-AROME will need to accurately account for glacier surface processes in these regions in order to be used to accurately compute the surface mass budget of ice sheets and glaciers, a key goal of regional climate modelling studies in Greenland.},

abstract = {The Greenland ice sheet is a major contributor to sea level rise, adding on average 0.47 ± 0.23 mm year − 1 to global mean sea level between 1991 and 2015. The cryosphere as a whole has contributed around 45{\%} of observed global sea level rise since 1993. Understanding the present-day state of the Greenland ice sheet is therefore vital for understanding the processes controlling the modern-day rates of sea level change and for making projections of sea level rise into the future. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of the mass budget of Greenland based on a diverse range of remote sensing observations to produce the essential climate variables (ECVs) of ice velocity, surface elevation change, grounding line location, calving front location, and gravimetric mass balance as well as numerical modelling that together build a consistent picture of a shrinking ice sheet. We also combine these observations with output from a regional climate model and from an ice sheet model to gain insight into existing biases in ice sheet dynamics and surface mass balance processes. Observations show surface lowering across virtually all regions of the ice sheet and at some locations up to −2.65 m year − 1 between 1995 and 2017 based on radar altimetry analysis. In addition, calving fronts at 28 study sites, representing a sample of typical glaciers, have retreated all around Greenland since the 1990s and in only two out of 28 study locations have they remained stable. During the same period, two of five floating ice shelves have collapsed while the locations of grounding lines at the remaining three floating ice shelves have remained stable over the observation period. In a detailed case study with a fracture model at Petermann glacier, we demonstrate the potential sensitivity of these floating ice shelves to future warming. GRACE gravimetrically-derived mass balance (GMB) data shows that overall Greenland has lost 255 ± 15 Gt year − 1 of ice over the period 2003 to 2016, consistent with that shown by IMBIE and a marked increase compared to a rate of loss of 83 ± 63 Gt year − 1 in the 1993–2003 period. Regional climate model and ice sheet model simulations show that surface mass processes dominate the Greenland ice sheet mass budget over most of the interior. However, in areas of high ice velocity there is a significant contribution to mass loss by ice dynamical processes. Marked differences between models and observations indicate that not all processes are captured accurately within models, indicating areas for future research.},

abstract = {We reconstruct the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet using a comprehensive survey of thickness, surface elevation, velocity, and surface mass balance (SMB) of 260 glaciers from 1972 to 2018. We calculate mass discharge, D, into the ocean directly for 107 glaciers (85{\%} of D) and indirectly for 110 glaciers (15{\%}) using velocity-scaled reference fluxes. The decadal mass balance switched from a mass gain of +47 ± 21 Gt/y in 1972–1980 to a loss of 51 ± 17 Gt/y in 1980–1990. The mass loss increased from 41 ± 17 Gt/y in 1990–2000, to 187 ± 17 Gt/y in 2000–2010, to 286 ± 20 Gt/y in 2010–2018, or sixfold since the 1980s, or 80 ± 6 Gt/y per decade, on average. The acceleration in mass loss switched from positive in 2000–2010 to negative in 2010–2018 due to a series of cold summers, which illustrates the difficulty of extrapolating short records into longer-term trends. Cumulated since 1972, the largest contributions to global sea level rise are from northwest (4.4 ± 0.2 mm), southeast (3.0 ± 0.3 mm), and central west (2.0 ± 0.2 mm) Greenland, with a total 13.7 ± 1.1 mm for the ice sheet. The mass loss is controlled at 66 ± 8{\%} by glacier dynamics (9.1 mm) and 34 ± 8{\%} by SMB (4.6 mm). Even in years of high SMB, enhanced glacier discharge has remained sufficiently high above equilibrium to maintain an annual mass loss every year since 1998.},

abstract = {Climate variability and change affect most socioeconomic sectors in West Africa. It is now admitted that the variability of climate has increased since the 1950s mainly because of the increased concentration of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In this study, we analyze the evolution of some extreme temperature and precipitation indices over a large area of West Africa spanning from latitudes 10-25°N and longitudes 17°W-15°E. The results show a general warming trend throughout the region during the period from 1960 to 2010, namely through a negative trend in the number of cool nights, and more frequent warm days and warm spells. This was the case not only for locations inside the continent, but also for those in coastal areas. Trends in rainfall related indices are not as uniform as the ones in temperatures. Nevertheless, a general tendency of decreased annual total rainfall and maximum number of consecutive wet days characterizes the study period. The cumulated rainfall of extremely wet days shows a positive trend in most locations. As for the maximum number of consecutive wet days, it shows an overall decreasing trend from 1960 to the mid 1980s, but starting from the late 1980s, an increasing trend is observed in several locations, indicating that extreme rainfall events have become more frequent in the West African Sahel during the last decade, compared to the 1961-1990 period. Policy implications of these observed trends may include investment and promotion of low cost and environmentally friendly energy production systems, the redesign of infrastructure and production systems to account for higher risks of losses due to floods and/or droughts, and the promotion of research for more heat tolerant crop/animal species and cultivars/breeds. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {The Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE) Network is a climate research network focused on developing and applying state of the art observational data to advance dynamical prediction, projections, and understanding of seasonal snow cover and sea ice in Canada and the circumpolar Arctic. Here, we present an assessment from the CanSISE Network on trends in the historical record of snow cover (fraction, water equivalent) and sea ice (area, concentration, type, and thickness) across Canada. We also assess projected changes in snow cover and sea ice likely to occur by mid-century, as simulated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) suite of Earth system models. The historical datasets show that the fraction of Canadian land and marine areas covered by snow and ice is decreasing over time, with seasonal and regional variability in the trends consistent with regional differences in surface temperature trends. In particular, summer sea ice cover has decreased significantly across nearly all Canadian marine regions, and the rate of multi-year ice loss in the Beaufort Sea and Canadian Arctic Archipelago has nearly doubled over the last 8 years. The multi-model consensus over the 2020-2050 period shows reductions in fall and spring snow cover fraction and sea ice concentration of 5-10ĝ€{\%} per decade (or 15-30ĝ€{\%} in total), with similar reductions in winter sea ice concentration in both Hudson Bay and eastern Canadian waters. Peak pre-melt terrestrial snow water equivalent reductions of up to 10ĝ€{\%} per decade (30ĝ€{\%} in total) are projected across southern Canada.},

abstract = {Five, daily, gridded, Northern Hemisphere snow water equivalent (SWE) datasets are analyzed over the 1981-2010 period in order to quantify the spatial and temporal consistency of satellite retrievals, land surface assimilation systems, physical snow models, and reanalyses. While the climatologies of total Northern Hemisphere snow water mass (SWM) vary among the datasets by as much as 50{\%}, their interannual variability and daily anomalies are comparable, showing moderate to good temporal correlations (between 0.60 and 0.85) on both interannual and intraseasonal time scales. Wintertime trends of total Northern Hemisphere SWM are consistently negative over the 1981-2010 period among the five datasets but vary in strength by a factor of 2-3. Examining spatial patterns of SWE indicates that the datasets are most consistent with one another over boreal forest regions compared to Arctic and alpine regions. Additionally, the datasets derived using relatively recent reanalyses are strongly correlated with one another and show better correlations with the satellite product [the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research (GlobSnow)] than do those using older reanalyses. Finally, a comparison of eight reanalysis datasets over the 2001-10 period shows that land surface model differences control the majority of spread in the climatological value of SWM, while meteorological forcing differences control the majority of the spread in temporal correlations of SWM anomalies.},

Interviews were conducted with professionals from multi‐disciplinary backgrounds. Also, data provided by the water agency were analysed to evaluate water governance practices. The main contribution of this paper is the generation of a blend of policies, good practices and tools to confront growing threats to water security and to attain sustainable development in Caribbean SIDS in an era of climate change and increasing non‐climatic stressors. The paper concludes that economic, environmental and human resources, reformed administrative and legislative systems, and technological tools are fundamental to achieving good water governance. Moreover, an array of complementary policies and technologies is needed to resolve water governance issues.

In parallel, AOD climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of this unique multi-year database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, sea-salt, sulfate, black and organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products: NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS, ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth-Probe) and METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4, the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS and MACC. Ground-based Level-2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this region, showing a relevant spatio-temporal variability and highlighting high dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the 2003–2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations, which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology. We extend the 2003–2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the 2003–2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosol-climate studies.},

abstract = {The present work aims at better understanding regional climate-aerosol interactions by studying the relationships between aerosols and synoptic atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Mediterranean region. Two 40-year simulations (1979-2018) have been carried out with version 6.3 of the Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques (National Centre for Meteorological Research)-Aire Limite{\'{e}} Adaptation dynamique D{\'{e}}veloppement InterNational (CNRM-ALADIN) regional climate model, one using interactive aerosols and the other one without any aerosol. The simulation with aerosols has been evaluated in terms of different climate and aerosol parameters. This evaluation shows a good agreement between the model and observations, significant improvements compared to the previous model version and consequently the relevance of using this model for the study of climate-aerosol interactions over this region. A first attempt to explain the climate variability of aerosols is based on the use of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. The latter explains a significant part of the interannual variability, notably in winter for the export of dust aerosols over the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Mediterranean, and in summer for the positive anomalies of anthropogenic aerosols over western Europe. This index is however not sufficient to fully understand the variations of aerosols in this region, notably at daily scale. The use of "weather regimes", namely persisting meteorological patterns, stable at synoptic scale for a few days, provides a relevant description of atmospheric circulation, which drives the emission, transport and deposition of aerosols. The four weather regimes usually defined in this area in winter and in summer bring significant information to answer this question. The blocking and NAOC regimes are largely favourable to strong aerosol effects on shortwave surface radiation and near-surface temperature, either because of higher aerosol loads or because of weaker cloud fraction, which reinforces the direct aerosol effect. Inversely, the NAO.. and Atlantic Ridge regimes are unfavourable to aerosol radiative effects, because of weaker aerosol concentrations and increased cloud cover. This study thus puts forward the strong dependence of aerosol loads on the synoptic circulation from interannual to daily scales and, as a consequence, the important modulation of the aerosol effects on shortwave surface radiation and near-surface temperature by atmospheric circulation. The role of cloud cover is essential in this modulation as shown by the use of weather regimes.},

abstract = {Abstract. The present study investigates the radiative effects of dust aerosols in the Mediterranean region during summer 2012 using a coupled regional aerosol–atmosphere–ocean model (CNRM-RCSM5). A prognostic aerosol scheme, including desert dust, sea salt, organic, black-carbon and sulphate particles, has been integrated to CNRM-RCSM5 in addition to the atmosphere, land surface and ocean components. An evaluation of this aerosol scheme of CNRM-RCSM5, and especially of the dust aerosols, has been performed against in situ and satellite measurements, showing its ability to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region in summer 2012. The dust vertical and size distributions have also been evaluated against observations from the TRAQA/ChArMEx campaign. Three simulations have been carried out for summer 2012 with CNRM-RCSM5, including the full prognostic aerosol scheme, only monthly-averaged AOD means from the aerosol scheme or no aerosols at all, in order to focus on the radiative effects of dust particles and the role of the prognostic scheme. Surface short-wave aerosol radiative forcing variability is found to be more than twice as high over regions affected by dust aerosols, when using a prognostic aerosol scheme instead of monthly AOD means. In this case downward surface solar radiation is also found to be better reproduced according to a comparison with several stations across the Mediterranean. A composite study over 14 stations across the Mediterranean, designed to identify days with high dust AOD, also reveals the improvement of the representation of surface temperature brought by the use of the prognostic aerosol scheme. Indeed the surface receives less radiation during dusty days, but only the simulation using the prognostic aerosol scheme is found to reproduce the observed intensity of the dimming and warming on dusty days. Moreover, the radiation and temperature averages over summer 2012 are also modified by the use of prognostic aerosols, mainly because of the differences brought in short-wave aerosol radiative forcing variability. Therefore this first comparison over summer 2012 highlights the importance of the choice of the representation of aerosols in climate models.},

The first step of this work focuses on dust particle emission size distribution modeling. We compare a parameterization in which the emission is based on the individual kinetic energy of the aggregates striking the surface to a recent parameterization based on an analogy with the fragmentation of brittle materials. The main difference between the two dust schemes concerns the mass proportion of fine aerosol that is reduced in the case of the new dust parameterization, with consequences for optical properties. At the episodic scale, comparisons between RegCM-4 simulations, satellite and ground-based data show a clear improvement using the new dust distribution in terms of aerosol optical depth (AOD) values and geographic gradients. These results are confirmed at the seasonal scale for the investigated year 2008. This change of dust distribution has sensitive impacts on the simulated regional dust budget, notably dry dust deposition and the regional direct aerosol radiative forcing over the Mediterranean basin. In particular, we find that the new size distribution produces a higher dust deposition flux, and smaller top of atmosphere (TOA) dust radiative cooling. A multi-annual simulation is finally carried out using the new dust distribution over the period 2000–2009. The average SW radiative forcing over the Mediterranean Sea reaches −13.6 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at the surface, and −5.5 W m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} at TOA.

In these regions, only a few future climate projections with high horizontal resolutions are available, although Central America and the Caribbean are characterized by spatial and temporal complexities in climate. Horizontal resolutions of 20 km and 60 km are comparable to those of regional climate models for a large region. Both the 20-km and 60-km mesh models reproduced reasonably well the observed seasonal precipitation patterns. Precipitation was projected to decrease in most of this region in all seasons by the end of this century. Evaporation from the ocean was projected to increase throughout the year, except in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, whereas evaporation from land areas was generally projected to decrease in the dry season and to increase in the rainy season. Surface soil moisture and total runoff in most land areas were therefore projected to decrease in both models in all seasons. Annual mean streamflow in the future climate was projected to decrease in most of Central America and the Caribbean as a result of decreased precipitation and increased evaporation. The values of hydroclimate variables over four land-only domains in the future climate changed significantly on a monthly basis within each season. In contrast, changes in the annual means of hydroclimate variables for individual countries were highly uncertain. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Japan Meteorological Agency / Meteorological Research Institute.},

The new Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) ensemble provides an opportunity to address the uncertainty in future projections for northern Australia. We find that the range in Australian monsoon projections from the available CMIP6 ensemble is substantially reduced compared to CMIP5, although models continue to disagree on the magnitude and direction of change. While previous CMIP5 studies identified warming in the western equatorial Pacific as important for Australian monsoon projections, here we show that the western Pacific is not strongly connected to northern Australian precipitation changes in the CMIP6 models. By comparing groups of models based on their future projections, we note that the model-to-model differences in Australian monsoon projections are congruent with the zonally averaged precipitation response in the Southern Hemisphere tropics within each model.},

abstract = {According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global tem- peratures have risen at an alarming pace since the early 20th century and this warming has been more pronounced since the 1970s. Temperature variations are significant because of their relation with thermal comfort and public health. In this study, we characterize the impacts of increasing maximum air temperatures in Sonora, Mexico. Heat days (HDs) and heat waves (HWs) were used as indicators to investigate historical trends in extreme heat. Furthermore, HDs were represented using a generalized linear regression model during the observed period (1966–2015) to generate future scenarios related to extreme heat and subsequently compared with six downscaled general circulation models (CNRM-CM5, CSIRO Mk3.6.0, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR and IPSL-CM5A-MR) under low and high radiative scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Results of this work indicate that climate stations in Sonora have exhibited increases in the number of HDs and HWs in the historical record that can be associated to physical factors such as elevation, urban land cover and the percent of annual rainfall during the summer. Statistical and model-based projections indicate that these trends will con- tinue in the future up to 2060, with less moderate increases and high uncertainty noted for the difference scenarios of the downscaled models. These observed and projected trends in extreme heat are important for identifying adaptation strategies in the public and environmental health sectors in Sonora.},

The purpose of this paper is to understand the consistency in the performance of models across the ensemble, space and seasons. For this a number of statistical measures like trend, correlation, variance, probability distribution function etc. are applied to evaluate the performance of models against observation and simultaneously the underlying uncertainties between them for four different seasons. The most evident finding from the study is the presence of a large cold bias (−6 to −8 °C) which is systematically seen across all the models and across space and time over the Himalayan region. However, these RCMs with its fine resolution perform extremely well in capturing the spatial distribution of the temperature features as indicated by a consistently high spatial correlation (greater than 0.9) with the observation in all seasons. In spite of underestimation in simulated temperature and general intensification of cold bias with increasing elevation the models show a greater rate of warming than the observation throughout entire altitudinal stretch of study region. During winter, the simulated rate of warming gets even higher at high altitudes. Moreover, a seasonal response of model performance and its spatial variability to elevation is found.},

Ground-based precipitation retrievals from the NAME Event Rain Gauge Network (NERN) and Colorado State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research (CSU–NCAR) version 2 radar composites over the southern NAME tier-I domain are compared with satellite rainfall estimates from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) operational and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 research satellite estimates along the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO). The rainfall estimates are examined alongside hourly images of high-resolution Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 11-$\mu$m brightness temperatures. An abrupt shallow to deep convective transition is found over the SMO, with the development of shallow convective systems just before noon on average over the SMO high peaks, with deep convection not developing until after 1500 local time on the SMO western slopes. This transition is shown to be contemporaneous with a relative underestimation (overestimation) of precipitation during the period of shallow (deep) convection from both IR and microwave precipitation algorithms due to changes in the depth and vigor of shallow clouds and mixed-phase cloud depths. This characteristic life cycle in cloud structure and microphysics has important implications for ice-scattering microwave and infrared precipitation estimates, and thus hydrological applications using high-resolution precipitation data, as well as the study of the dynamics of convective systems in complex terrain. },

abstract = {There has been a paucity of information on trends in daily climate and climate extremes, especially from developing countries. We report the results of the analysis of daily temperature (maximum and minimum) and precipitation data from 14 south and west African countries over the period 1961-2000. Data were subject to quality control and processing into indices of climate extremes for release to the global community. Temperature extremes show patterns consistent with warming over most of the regions analyzed, with a large proportion of stations showing statistically significant trends for all temperature indices. Over 1961 to 2000, the regionally averaged occurrence of extreme cold (fifth percentile) days and nights has decreased by -3.7 and -6.0 days/decade, respectively. Over the same period, the occurrence of extreme hot (95th percentile) days and nights has increased by 8.2 and 8.6 days/decade, respectively. The average duration of warm (cold) has increased (decreased) by 2.4 (0.5) days/decade and warm spells. Overall, it appears that the hot tails of the distributions of daily maximum temperature have changed more than the cold tails; for minimum temperatures, hot tails show greater changes in the NW of the region, while cold tails have changed more in the SE and east. The diurnal temperature range (DTR) does not exhibit a consistent trend across the region, with many neighboring stations showing opposite trends. However, the DTR shows consistent increases in a zone across Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and Mozambique, coinciding with more rapid increases in maximum tempemture than minimum temperature extremes. Most precipitation indices do not exhibit consistent or statistically significant trends across the region. Regionally averaged total precipitation has decreased but is not statistically significant. At the same time, there has been a statistically significant increase in regionally averaged daily rainfall intensity and dry spell duration. While the majority of stations also show increasing trends for these two indices, only a few of these are statistically significant. There are increasing trends in regionally averaged rainfall on extreme precipitation days and in maximum-annual 5-day and 1-day rainfall, but only trends for the latter are statistically significant.

Forced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), 18 experiments were carried out using different combinations of cumulus parameterization and ocean flux schemes. Twelve extreme indices for both rainfall and temperature were estimated from the model output. A statistical omega index was used to measure the degree of similarity among the 18 experiments in phase and shape. The results showed relatively high similarities among the experiments over mainland Asia compared to those over the Maritime Continent for both seasonal and inter-annual variability. The extreme rainfall indices had a lower omega compared to that of temperature. Observed daily rainfall and temperature data at 52 meteorological stations over the SEA region were used to validate the simulated extreme indices. The results showed that extreme temperature indices were generally underestimated across the region. Systematic biases for each simulated rainfall index were also identified. A score ranking system was established to compare the relative performance of the 18 experiments over the 52 selected stations objectively. It was shown that the experiments with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-Emanuel scheme performed relatively better than the other convective schemes. The combination of the MIT-Emanuel convective scheme with the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer scheme (BATS1e) ocean flux scheme produced the best performance.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades the primary driver of mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has been warm ocean water underneath coastal ice shelves, not a warmer atmosphere. Yet, surface melt occurs sporadically over low-lying areas of the WAIS and is not fully understood. Here we report on an episode of extensive and prolonged surface melting observed in the Ross Sea sector of the WAIS in January 2016. A comprehensive cloud and radiation experiment at the WAIS ice divide, downwind of the melt region, provided detailed insight into the physical processes at play during the event. The unusual extent and duration of the melting are linked to strong and sustained advection of warm marine air toward the area, likely favoured by the concurrent strong El Ni{\~{n}}o event. The increase in the number of extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o events projected for the twenty-first century could expose the WAIS to more frequent major melt events.},

abstract = {There is a general lack of information about the potential effects of 1.5, 2 or more degrees of global warming on the regional climates within Africa, and most studies that address this use data from coarse resolution global models. Using a large ensemble of CORDEX Africa simulations, we present a pan-African overview of the effects of 1.5 and 2°C global warming levels (GWLs) on the African climate. The CORDEX simulations, consistent with their driving global models, show a robust regional warming exceeding the mean global one over most of Africa. The highest increase in annual mean temperature is found over the subtropics and the smallest one over many coastal regions. Projected changes in annual mean precipitation have a tendency to wetter conditions in some parts of Africa (e.g. central/eastern Sahel and eastern Africa) at both GWLs, but models' agreement on the sign of change is low. In contrast to mean precipitation there is a consistent increase in daily precipitation intensity of wet days over a large fraction of tropical Africa emerging already at 1.5°C GWL and strengthening at 2°C. A consistent difference between 2°C and 1.5°C warmings is also found for projected changes in annual mean temperature and daily precipitation intensity. Our study indicates that a 0.5°C further warming (from 1.5°C to 2°C) can indeed produce a robust change in some aspects of the African climate and its extremes.},

abstract = {Changes of snow occurrence across the central and eastern United States under future warming for the late 21 st century are investigated by applying an empirical hyperbolic tangent function to both observed and downscaled high spatial resolution (∼12.5 km) daily temperature and precipitation, to compare the historical (1981-2000) and future (2081-2100) snow occurrence. The observed distributions of snow frequency show that snow-rain transition zones are mainly zonally distributed, since they are largely determined by temperature, with slight shifts to the south over the Appalachian Mountains. The snow-rain transition zone is located around 38-46°N for November and March, and 32-42°N for winter months (DJF). These observed patterns are reproduced well for the historical period by an ensemble average of multiple general circulation models (GCMs). The probabilistic projections show that the snow-rain transition zone will shift to the north under the background of global warming at magnitudes of 2-6 °C, indicating that large areas will experience a partial, or even a very large, loss of snow occurrence in the future. The northward shifts are about 2° latitude under the representative concentration pathways 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario and 4° latitude under the RCP8.5 scenario. The percentages of the area losing snow occurrence are also assessed.},

abstract = {Extreme climate events, either being linked to dry spells or extreme precipitation, are of major concern in Africa, a region in which the economy and population are highly vulnerable to climate hazards. However, recent trends in climate events are not often documented in this poorly surveyed continent. This study makes use of a large set of daily rain gauge data covering Southern West Africa (extending from 10° W to 10° E and from 4° N to 12° N) from 1950 to 2014. The evolution of the number and the intensity of daily rainfall events, especially the most extremes, were analyzed at the annual and seasonal scales. During the first rainy season (April–July), mean annual rainfall is observed to have a minor trend due to less frequent but more intense rainfall mainly along the coast of Southern West Africa (SWA) over the last two decades. The north–south seasonal changes exhibit an increase in mean annual rainfall over the last decade during the second rainy season (September–November) linked by both an increase in the frequency of occurrence of rainy days as well as an increase in the mean intensity and extreme events over the last decade. The study also provides evidence of a disparity that exists between the west and east of SWA, with the east recording a stronger increase in the mean intensity of wet days and extreme rainfall during the second rainy season (September–November).},

abstract = {We discuss Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface mass balance (SMB) differences between the updated polar version of the RACMO climate model (RACMO2.3) and the previous version (RACMO2.1). Among other revisions, the updated model includes an adjusted rainfall-to-snowfall conversion that produces exclusively snowfall under freezing conditions; this especially favours snowfall in summer. Summer snowfall in the ablation zone of the GrIS has a pronounced effect on melt rates, affecting modelled GrIS SMB in two ways. By covering relatively dark ice with highly reflective fresh snow, these summer snowfalls have the potential to locally reduce melt rates in the ablation zone of the GrIS through the snow-albedo-melt feedback. At larger scales, SMB changes are driven by differences in orographic precipitation following a shift in large-scale circulation, in combination with enhanced moisture to precipitation conversion for warm to moderately cold conditions. A detailed comparison of model output with observations from automatic weather stations, ice cores and ablation stakes shows that the model update generally improves the simulated SMB-elevation gradient as well as the representation of the surface energy balance, although significant biases remain.},

abstract = {The Amazonian tropical forests have been disappearing at a fast rate in the last 50 y due to deforestation to open areas for agriculture, posing high risks of irreversible changes to biodiversity and ecosystems. Climate change poses additional risks to the stability of the forests. Studies suggest “tipping points” not to be transgressed: 4° C of global warming or 40{\%} of total deforested area. The regional development debate has focused on attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation with intensification of traditional agriculture. Large reductions of deforestation in the last decade open up opportunities for an alternative model based on seeing the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets for the creation of high-value products and ecosystem services.For half a century, the process of economic integration of the Amazon has been based on intensive use of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources, which has brought significant basin-wide environmental alterations. The rural development in the Amazonia pushed the agricultural frontier swiftly, resulting in widespread land-cover change, but agriculture in the Amazon has been of low productivity and unsustainable. The loss of biodiversity and continued deforestation will lead to high risks of irreversible change of its tropical forests. It has been established by modeling studies that the Amazon may have two “tipping points,” namely, temperature increase of 4 °C or deforestation exceeding 40{\%} of the forest area. If transgressed, large-scale “savannization” of mostly southern and eastern Amazon may take place. The region has warmed about 1 °C over the last 60 y, and total deforestation is reaching 20{\%} of the forested area. The recent significant reductions in deforestation—80{\%} reduction in the Brazilian Amazon in the last decade—opens up opportunities for a novel sustainable development paradigm for the future of the Amazon. We argue for a new development paradigm—away from only attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation versus intensification of traditional agriculture and expansion of hydropower capacity—in which we research, develop, and scale a high-tech innovation approach that sees the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets that can enable the creation of innovative high-value products, services, and platforms through combining advanced digital, biological, and material technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in progress.},

abstract = {The Svalbard Airport composite series spanning the period from 1898 to the present represents one of very few long-term instrumental temperature series from the High Arctic. A homogenized monthly temperature series is available since 2014. Here we increase the resolution from a monthly to daily basis, and further digitization of historical data has reduced the uncertainty of the series. The most pronounced changes in the 120-year record occur during the last three decades. For the 1991–2018 period the number of days warmer than 0 and 5 °C has increased by 25 (21{\%}) and 22 (59{\%}), respectively, per year compared to the 1961–1990 standard normal. Likewise, comparing the same periods, the number of days colder than −10 and −20 °C has decreased by 42 (32{\%}) and 27 (62{\%}), respectively. During the entire time span of the series, the western Spitsbergen climate has gone through stepwise changes, alternating between cold and warm regimes: 1899–1929 was cold, 1930–1961 warm, 1962–1998 cold and 1999–2018 warm. The latest cold regime was 1.0 °C warmer than the first cold one, and the latest warm regime was 1.7 °C warmer than the previous warm one. For the whole series the linear trend for annual means amounts to 0.32°C/decade, which is about 3.5 times the increase of the global mean temperature for the same period. Since 1991, the rate of warming at Svalbard Airport is 1.7 °C/decade, which is more than twice the Arctic average (0.8 °C/decade, north of 66 °N) and about seven times the global average for the same period.},

abstract = {Along with the amplified warming and dramatic sea ice decline, the Arctic has experienced regionally and seasonally variable moistening of the atmosphere. Based on reanalysis data, this study demonstrates that the regional moistening patterns during the last four decades, 1979–2018, were predominantly shaped by the strong trends in horizontal moisture transport. Our results suggest that the trends in moisture transport were largely driven by changes in atmospheric circulation. Trends in evaporation in the Arctic had a smaller role in shaping the moistening patterns. Both horizontal moisture transport and local evaporation have been affected by the diminishing sea ice cover during the cold seasons from autumn to spring. Increases in evaporation have been restricted to the vicinity of the sea ice margin over a limited period during the local sea ice decline. For the first time we demonstrate that, after the sea ice has disappeared from a region, evaporation over the open sea has had negative trends due to the effect of horizontal moisture transport to suppress evaporation. Near the sea ice margin, the trends in moisture transport and evaporation and the cloud response to those have been circulation dependent. The future moisture and cloud distributions in the Arctic are expected to respond to changes in atmospheric pressure patterns; circulation and moisture transport will also control where and when efficient surface evaporation can occur.},

abstract = {Abstract. Projections of future climate change play a fundamental role in improving understanding of the climate system as well as characterizing societal risks and response options. The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.},

While manual snow surveys can directly provide SWE measurements, they are time consuming and costly, especially compared to automated snow depth measurements. Moreover, SWE is strongly correlated to snow depth. For this reason, several empirical equations relating snow depth to SWE have been proposed. The present study investigates the potential of artificial neural networks for estimating SWE from snow depth and commonly available data, and the proposed method is compared to existing, regression-based methods. An ensemble of multilayer perceptrons is constructed and trained using gridded meteorological variables and a data set of almost 40,000 SWE and depth measurements from the province of Quebec (eastern Canada). Overall, the proposed artificial neural network-based method reached a RMSE of 28 mm and outperforms by 17{\%} a series of empirical equations for estimating the SWE of an independent set of measurement sites. Nevertheless, all the tested methods demonstrated limits to estimate lowest values of snow bulk density.},

abstract = {Abstract Changes in seasonal and diurnal precipitation types over South Korea during summer in the late twenty-first century (2081–2100) were projected under four RCP scenarios using the Regional Climate Model (RegCM4.0) with a horizontal resolution of 12.5 km. Two boundary conditions, ERA-Interim and HadGEM2-AO, were used to drive the RegCM4.0 (jointly named RG4{\_}ERA and RG4{\_}HG2, respectively). In general, the RegCM4.0 reproduces the spatial distribution of summer precipitation over Northeast Asia for the current climate (1989–2008) reasonably well. The RG4{\_}HG2 shows larger dry biases over South Korea, when compared with observations, than does the RG4{\_}ERA. These strong dry biases result from the underestimation of convective precipitation (CPR) and are particularly noticeable in late afternoons during July and August. It is related to the performance of HadGEM2-AO which simulated southwesterly winds weakly in that time. However, interestingly, the RG4{\_}HG2 simulates similar increases in the contribution of CPR to total precipitation after mid-July, resulting in comparable performance in the reproduction of heavy precipitation. In the late twenty-first century, a significant increase (decrease) in CPR (NCPR) is generally projected over South Korea, and particularly under the RCP8.5. During June, the total precipitation is affected primarily by changes in NCPR under RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. After mid-July, increasing total precipitation is primarily caused by the distinct increases in CPR in the late afternoons; this pattern is particularly noticeable under RCP8.5, which is associated with more destabilized atmospheric conditions during July and August. Light and heavy precipitation are projected to decrease and increase, respectively, under RCP8.5.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: NARCliM (New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory Regional Climate Modelling project) is a climate downscaling project for Australia and the surrounding regions. Present and future climate simulations are performed using a 1-way nested dynamical downscaling approach and span 2 domains. We focus on the inner 10 km domain that extends across south-east Australia. Three regional climate models (RCMs) based on the Weather Research and Forecasting System (WRF) version 3.3 dynamically downscale 4 global climate model (GCM) simulations to finer resolutions. This project complements and improves on already available GCM projections for the region. Our simulations cover 3 epochs: present (1990-2009), near future (2020-2039), and far future (2060-2079). Here, we focus on the mean surface air temperature and precipitation. The RCMs are better able to capture spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation and improve the temperature root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the GCMs, at least for the inner domain. The RCMs tend to be biased cold compared to observations and are wetter than the GCMs during warm seasons. The downscaled RCM projections exhibit a weaker warming over land compared to the GCMs. The RCMs project no significant precipitation changes in the far future over most areas. However, Victoria is expected to see significant springtime drying of 15 mm mo-1, which is considerably higher than previous GCM results. This drying is associated with a larger strengthening of the subtropical ridge than modelled previously by the GCMs. In addition, the RCMs project significant precipitation changes in contradicting directions for some inland areas during winter.},

abstract = {This study presents potential future variations of mean rainfall and temperature over East Africa (EA) based on five models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 4.5 and 8.5. In this study, climate simulations of two timeframes, a baseline period (1961–1990) and projection period (2071–2100), are compared. The models reproduce EA's bimodal rainfall pattern but overestimate and underestimate seasonal rainfall of October–December (OND) and March–May (MAM), respectively. Rainfall is projected to increase under the two scenarios. Larger increases in rainfall will occur during the OND season than during the MAM season and in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5. During the last half of the 21st century, EA is likely to warm by 1.7–2.8 and 2.2–5.4 ∘ C under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, relative to the baseline period. Scenario uncertainty is projected to exceed model uncertainty from the middle to the end of the 21st century. The central parts of Kenya and the Lake Victoria Basin will witness the highest increases in seasonal rainfall. The probability density functions (PDFs) of future seasonal rainfall show a positive shift and a statistically insignificant increase in variance relative to the baseline. Thus, EA is likely to experience an increase in extreme rainfall events. Understanding the future climate variability in EA is important for planning purposes but these results are based on relatively course resolution models prone to bias and therefore should be used with caution. There is a need for further research on climate projections over EA, including determining the causes of the poor performance of global models in reproducing rainfall climatology and trends over the region.},

abstract = {In this study, outputs of three statistical downscaling (SD) methods including the change factor (Delta), simplified (simQP) and advanced (wetQP) quantile-perturbation-based approaches were compared based on daily rainfall series at 9 meteorological stations in the Lake Victoria basin (LVB) in Eastern Africa. The comparison was made considering phase 5 and phase 3 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project, i.e. CMIP5 and CMIP3 respectively. For the CMIP5 (CMIP3) at each station, there were a total of 7 (14) GCMs, 18 (20) daily historical (control) simulations over the period 1961-2000, and 35 (49) daily future projection series of the periods 2050s and 2090s. The ensemble mean of the GCMs' Bias in reproducing rainfall extremes for return periods in the range of 1 to 40 years for the CMIP5 (CMIP3) varied from -19.05{\%} to 3.11{\%} (-65.85{\%} to -4.86{\%}). For the high greenhouse gas scenario rcp8.5 (A2) of the CMIP5 (CMIP3), the ensemble mean of the projected changes over the LVB in the 10-year rainfall intensity quantile obtained from the Delta, simQP, wetQP SD goes up to 5.8, 10 and 22.4{\%} (11.7, 15.9 and 43.6{\%}) in the 2050s and 8, 11.4, and 25.4{\%} (14.2, 23.3 and 40.6{\%}) in the 2090s. Rainfall totals of the main wet (dry) season are generally projected to increase (decrease) in both the 2050s and 2090s. Because the outputs from the three SD methods captured well the pattern of monthly rainfall totals, the difference between the projected changes of seasonal or annual rainfall totals from the Delta, simQP and wetQP was shown to be insignificant. However, the differences in the results from the Delta, simQP and wetQP methods with respect to the projections of rainfall quantiles indicate that the choice of the SD method can be made on a case by case basis in line with the objectives of the climate change impact study, e.g. the Delta does not capture well the changes in rainfall extremes, whereas the wetQP is suitable for both rainfall extremes and rainfall totals at both seasonal and annual time scales. The findings of this study also show the need to consider evaluations of the inter-GCM differences in the LVB as a data scarce region in assessing the discernible impact of climate change on rainfall extremes and/totals for decision making related to water resources management and engineering.},

@article{Orsolini2019,
abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) region, often referred to as the Third Pole, is the world's highest plateau and exerts a considerable influence on regional and global climate. The state of the snowpack over the TP is a major research focus due to its great impact on the headwaters of a dozen major Asian rivers. While many studies have attempted to validate atmospheric reanalyses over the TP area in terms of temperature or precipitation, there have been - remarkably - no studies aimed at systematically comparing the snow depth or snow cover in global reanalyses with satellite and in situ data. Yet, snow in reanalyses provides critical surface information for forecast systems from the medium to sub-seasonal timescales. Here, snow depth and snow cover from four recent global reanalysis products, namely the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 and ERA-Interim reanalyses, the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) and the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), are intercompared over the TP region. The reanalyses are evaluated against a set of 33 in situ station observations, as well as against the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow cover and a satellite microwave snow depth dataset. The high temporal correlation coefficient (0.78) between the IMS snow cover and the in situ observations provides confidence in the station data despite the relative paucity of in situ measurement sites and the harsh operating conditions. While several reanalyses show a systematic overestimation of the snow depth or snow cover, the reanalyses that assimilate local in situ observations or IMS snow cover are better capable of representing the shallow, transient snowpack over the TP region. The latter point is clearly demonstrated by examining the family of reanalyses from the ECMWF, of which only the older ERA-Interim assimilated IMS snow cover at high altitudes, while ERA5 did not consider IMS snow cover for high altitudes. We further tested the sensitivity of the ERA5-Land model in offline experiments, assessing the impact of blown snow sublimation, snow cover to snow depth conversion and, more importantly, excessive snowfall. These results suggest that excessive snowfall might be the primary factor for the large overestimation of snow depth and cover in ERA5 reanalysis. Pending a solution for this common model precipitation bias over the Himalayas and the TP, future snow reanalyses that optimally combine the use of satellite snow cover and in situ snow depth observations in the assimilation and analysis cycles have the potential to improve medium-range to sub-seasonal forecasts for water resources applications.},

abstract = {We analyze the potential effect of global warming levels (GWLs) of 1.5 and 2 o C above pre-industrial levels (1861-1890) on mean temperature and precipitation as well as intra-seasonal precipitation extremes over the Greater Horn of Africa. We used a large, 25-member regional climate model ensemble from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment and show that, compared to the control period of 1971-2000, annual mean near-surface temperature is projected to increase by more than 1 and 1.5 o C over most parts of the Greater Horn of Africa, under GWLs of 1.5 and 2 o C respectively. Highest temperature increases are projected in the northern region, covering most parts of Sudan and northern parts of Ethiopia, and the lowest temperature increases are projected over the coastal belt of Tanzania. However, the projected mean surface temperature difference between 2 and 1. 5 o C GWLs is higher than 0.5 o C over nearly all land points, reaching 0.8 o C over Sudan and northern Ethiopia. This implies that the Greater Horn of Africa will warm faster than the global mean. While projected changes in precipitation are mostly uncertain across the Greater Horn of Africa, there is a substantial decrease over the central and northern parts of Ethiopia. Additionally, the length of dry and wet spells is projected to increase and decrease respectively. The combined effect of a reduction in rainfall and the changes in the wet and dry spells will likely impact negatively on the livelihoods of people within the coastal cities, lake regions, highlands as well as arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan. The probable impacts of these changes on key sectors such as agriculture, water, energy and health sectors, will likely call for formulation of actionable policies geared towards adaptation and mitigation of the impacts of a 1.5 and 2 °C warming.},

abstract = {A band of cooling that extends across mid-latitude Eurasia is identified in the wintertime surface air temperatures of the latest ECMWF reanalysis. This cooling is related to extreme warming around the Kara Sea through changes in the meridional temperature gradient. Surface temperatures in the Arctic have risen faster than those at lower latitudes, and as the Arctic warming increases, this north-south temperature gradient is weakened. This change in the meridional temperature gradient causes a decrease in the westerly winds that help maintain the mild European climate by transporting heat from the Atlantic. Since decreasing sea ice concentrations have been shown to be a driving factor in Arctic amplification, a singular value decomposition analysis is used to confirm the co-variability of the Arctic sea ice, including the Kara Sea, and the temperatures over the mid-latitude Eurasia. These findings suggest that decreasing sea ice concentrations can change the meridional temperature gradient and hence the large-scale atmospheric flow of the Northern Hemisphere. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This article provides a synthesis of the latest observational trends and projections for the future of the Arctic. First, the Arctic is already changing rapidly as a result of climate change. Contemporary warm Arctic temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75{\%} volume loss) demonstrate climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature increases to near 2 °C will leave the Arctic a much different environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic temperature increase of +4 °C. Second, even under ambitious emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation. Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate. In light of these trends, the precautionary principle calls for early adaptation and mitigation actions.},

abstract = {The climate in the Arctic is changing faster than in midlatitudes. This is shown by increased temperatures, loss of summer sea ice, earlier snow melt, impacts on ecosystems, and increased economic access. Arctic sea ice volume has decreased by 75{\%} since the 1980s. Long-lasting global anthropogenic forcing from carbon dioxide has increased over the previous decades and is anticipated to increase over the next decades. Temperature increases in response to greenhouse gases are amplified in the Arctic through feedback processes associated with shifts in albedo, ocean and land heat storage, and near-surface longwave radiation fluxes. Thus, for the next few decades out to 2040, continuing envi-ronmental changes in the Arctic are very likely, and the appropriate response is to plan for adaptation to these changes. For example, it is very likely that the Arctic Ocean will become seasonally nearly sea ice free before 2050 and possibly within a decade or two, which in turn will further increase Arctic tem-peratures, economic access, and ecological shifts. Mitigation becomes an important option to reduce potential Arctic impacts in the second half of the 21st century. Using the most recent set of climate model projections (CMIP5), multimodel mean temperature projections show an Arctic-wide end of century increase of +13 ∘ C in late fall and +5 ∘ C in late spring for a business-as-usual emission scenario (RCP8.5) in contrast to +7 ∘ C in late fall and +3 ∘ C in late spring if civilization follows a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5). Such temperature increases demonstrate the heightened sensitivity of the Arctic to greenhouse gas forcing.},

The HadGEM2-ES global climate model of the Met Office Hadley Centre and the MPI-ESM-MR global climate model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology were downscaled to 50 km for the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Region 8. We investigated the seasonal time-scale performance of RegCM4.3.5 in reproducing observed climatology over the domain of the Central Asia by using two different global climate model outputs. For the future climatology of the domain, the regional model projects relatively high warming in the warm season with a decrease in precipitation in almost all parts of the domain. A warming trend is notable, especially for the northern part of the domain during the cold season. The results of our study show that surface air temperatures in the region will increase between 3 °C and about 7 °C on average, according to the emission scenarios for the period of 2071–2100 with respect to past period of 1971–2000. Therefore, the projected warming and decrease in precipitation might adversely affect the ecological and socio-economic systems of this region, which is already a mostly arid and semi-arid environment.},

Convection-permitting modeling (CPM) enhances the representation of regional climate by better resolving the regional forcings and processes, associated with topography and land cover, in response to variability in the large-scale atmospheric circulation. We performed dynamically downscaled simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the Upper and Lower Colorado basin at 12 km and 3 km grid spacing from 2000 to 2010 to investigate the potential of dynamical downscaling to improved the modeled representation of precipitation the Southwestern United States. Employing a convection-permitting nested domain of 3 km resolution significantly reduces the bias in mean (∼2 mm/day) and extreme (∼4 mm/day) summer precipitation when compared to coarser domain of 12 km resolution and coarse resolution CFSR products. The convection-permitting modeling product also better represents eastward propagation of organized convection due to mesoscale convective systems at a sub-daily scale, which largely account for extreme summer rainfall during the North American monsoon. In the cool season both coarse and high-resolution simulations perform well with limited bias of ∼1 mm/day for the mean and ∼2 mm/day for the extreme precipitation. Significant correlation was found (∼0.85 for summer and ∼0.65 for winter) for both coarse and high-resolution model with observed regionally and seasonally averaged precipitation. Our findings suggest that the use of CPM is necessary in a dynamical modeling system for S2S prediction in this region, especially during the warm season when precipitation is mostly convectively driven.},

abstract = {On average, the models in the Fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project archive predict an increase in Antarctic precipitation from 5.5 to 24.5 {\%} between 1986–2005 and 2080–2099, depending on greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. This translates into a moderation of future sea level rise ranging from −19 to −71 mm between 2006 and 2099. However, comparison with CloudSat and ERA-Interim data show that almost all the models overestimate current Antarctic precipitation, some by more than 100 {\%}. If only the models that agree with CloudSat data within 20 {\%} of error are considered, larger precipitation changes (from 7.4 to 29.3 {\%}) and impact on sea level (from −25 to −85 mm) are predicted. A common practice of averaging all models to evaluate climate projections thus leads to a significant underestimation of the contribution of Antarctic precipitation to future sea level. Models simulate, on average, a 7.4 {\%}/°C precipitation change with surface temperature warming. The models in better agreement with CloudSat observations for Antarctic snowfall predict, on average, larger temperature and Antarctic sea ice cover changes, which could explain the larger changes in Antarctic precipitation simulated by these models. The agreement between the models, CloudSat data and ERA-Interim is generally less in the interior of Antarctica than at the peripheries, but the interior is also where climate change will induce the smallest absolute change in precipitation. About three-quarters of the impact on sea level will result from precipitation change over the half most peripheral and lowest elevation part of the surface of Antarctica.},

abstract = {Abstract. Climate models predict Antarctic precipitation to increase during the 21st century, but their present day Antarctic precipitation differs. A model-independent climatology of the Antarctic precipitation characteristics, such as snowfall rates and frequency, is needed to assess the models, but it is not yet available. Satellite observations of precipitation by active sensors has been possible in the polar regions since the launch of CloudSat in 2006. Here, we use two CloudSat products to generate the first multi-year, model-independent climatology of Antarctic precipitation. The first product is used to determine the frequency and the phase of precipitation, while the second product is used to assess the snowfall rate. The mean snowfall rate from August 2006 to April 2011 is 171 mm year−1 over the Antarctic ice sheet, north of 82° S. While uncertainties on individual precipitation retrievals from CloudSat data are potentially large, the mean uncertainty should be much smaller, but cannot be easily estimated. There are no in situ measurements of Antarctic precipitation to directly assess the new climatology. However, distributions of both precipitation occurrences and rates generally agree with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim data set, the production of which is constrained by various in situ and satellite observations, but does not use any data from CloudSat. The new data set thus offers unprecedented capability to quantitatively assess Antarctic precipitation statistics and rates in climate models.},

abstract = {We present the results of the application of the COSMO-CLM Regional Climate Model (CCLM) over the CORDEX-Africa domain. Two simulations were performed driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis (1989-2008): the first one with the standard CORDEX spatial resolution (0.44°), and the second one with an unprecedented high resolution (0.22°). Low-level circulation and its vertical structure, the geographical and temporal evolution of temperature and precipitation are critically evaluated, together with the radiation budget and surface energy fluxes. CCLM is generally able to reproduce the overall features of the African climate, although some deficiencies are evident. Flow circulation is generally well simulated, but an excessive pressure gradient is present between the Gulf of Guinea and the Sahara, related to a marked warm bias over the Sahara and a cold bias over southern Sahel. CCLM underestimates the rainfall peak in the regions affected by the passage of the monsoon. This dry bias may be a consequence of two factors, the misplacement of the monsoon centre and the underestimation of its intensity. The former is related to the northern shift of the West African Heat Low. On the other hand, the underestimation of precipitation intensity may be related to the underestimation of the surface short-wave radiation and latent heat flux. The increase of the model resolution does not bring evident improvements to the results for monthly means statistics. As a result, it appears that 0.44° is a suitable compromise between model performances and computational constrains. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Recent studies have examined the relationship between the intensity of extreme rainfall and temperature. Two main reasons justify this interest. First, the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere is governed by the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) equation. Second, the temperature dependence of extreme-intensity rainfalls should follow a similar relationship assuming relative humidity remains constant and extreme rainfalls are driven by the actual water content of the atmosphere. The relationship between extreme rainfall intensity and air temperature (Pextr–Ta) was assessed by analyzing maximum daily rainfall intensities for durations ranging from 5 min to 12 h for more than 100 meteorological stations across Canada. Different factors that could influence this relationship have been analyzed. It appears that the duration and the climatic region have a strong influence on this relationship. For short durations, the Pextr–Ta relationship is close to the CC scaling for coastal regions while a super-CC scaling followed by an upper limit is observed for inland regions. As the duration increases, the slope of the relationship Pextr–Ta decreases for all regions. The shape of the Pextr–Ta curve is not sensitive to the percentile or season. Complementary analyses have been carried out to understand the departures from the expected Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. The relationship between dewpoint temperature and extreme rainfall intensity shows that the relative humidity is a limiting factor for inland regions, but not for coastal regions. Using hourly rainfall series, an event-based analysis is proposed in order to understand other deviations (super-CC, sub-CC, and monotonic decrease). The analyses suggest that the observed scaling is primarily due to the rainfall event dynamic.},

abstract = {An anticipated consequence of ongoing global warming is the intensification of the rainfall regimes meaning longer dry spells and heavier precipitation when it rains, with potentially high hydrological and socio-economic impacts. The semi-arid regions of the intertropical band, such as the Sahel, are facing particularly serious challenges in this respect since their population is strongly vulnerable to extreme climatic events. Detecting long term trends in the Sahelian rainfall regime is thus of great societal importance, while being scientifically challenging because datasets allowing for such detection studies are rare in this region. This study addresses this challenge by making use of a large set of daily rain gauge data covering the Sahel (defined in this study as extending from 20°W-10°E and from 11°N-18°N) since 1950, combined with an unparalleled 5 minute rainfall observations available since 1990 over the AMMA-CATCH Niger observatory. The analysis of the daily data leads to the assertion that a hydro-climatic intensification is actually taking place in the Sahel, with an increasing mean intensity of rainy days associated with a higher frequency of heavy rainfall. This leads in turn to highlight that the return to wetter annual rainfall conditions since the beginning of the 2000s - succeeding the 1970-2000 drought - is by no mean a recovery towards the much smoother regime that prevailed during the 1950s and 1960s. It also provides a vision of the contrasts existing between the West Sahel and the East Sahel, the East Sahel experiencing a stronger increase of extreme rainfall. This regional vision is complemented by a local study at sub-daily timescales carried out thanks to the 5 minute rainfall series of the AMMA-CATCH Niger observatory (12000 km2). The increasing intensity of extreme rainfall is also visible at sub-daily timescales, the annual maximum intensities have increased at an average rate of 2{\%}-6{\%} per decade since 1990 for timescales ranging from 5 min to 1 hour. Both visions - regional/long term/daily on the one hand, and local/27/years/sub-daily, on the other - converge to the conclusion that, rather than a rainfall recovery, the Sahel is experiencing a new era of climate extremes that roughly started at the beginning of this century.},

abstract = {In this study, five regional climate models (RCMs) participating in the CORDEX-East Asia project (HadGEM3-RA, RegCM4, SNU-MM5, SNU-WRF, and YSU-RSM) are evaluated in terms of their performances in simulating the climatology of summer extremes in East Asia. Seasonal maxima of daily mean temperature and precipitation are analyzed using the generalized extreme value method. RCMs show systematic bias patterns in both seasonal means and extremes. A cold bias is located along the coast, whereas a warm bias occurs in northern China. Overall, wet bias occurs in East Asia, but with a substantial dry bias centered in South Korea. This dry bias appears to be related to the colder ocean surface around South Korea, positioning the monsoonal front further south compared to observations. Taylor diagram analyses reveal that the models simulate temperature means more accurately compared to extremes because of the higher spatial correlation, whereas precipitation extremes are simulated better than their means because of the higher spatial variability. The latter implies that extreme rainfall events can be captured more accurately by RCMs compared to the driving GCM despite poorer simulation of mean rainfall. Inter-RCM analysis indicates a close relationship between the means and extremes in terms of model skills, but it does not show a clear relationship between temperature and precipitation. Sub-regional analysis largely supports the mean–extreme skill relationship. Analyses of frequency and intensity distributions of daily data for three selected sub-regions suggest that overall shifts of temperature distribution and biases in moderate–heavy precipitations contribute importantly to the seasonal mean biases.},

abstract = {This study conducted an updated analysis of the long-term temperature trends over South Korea and reassessed the contribution of the urbanization effect to the local warming trends. Linear trends were analyzed for three different periods over South Korea in order to consider possible inhomogeneity due to changes in the number of available stations: recent 103 years (1912?2014), 61 years (1954?2014), and 42 years (1973?2014). The local temperature has increased by 1.90°C, 1.35°C, and 0.99°C during the three periods, respectively, which are found 1.4?2.6 times larger than the global land mean trends. The countries located in the northern middle and high latitudes exhibit similar warming trends (about 1.5 times stronger than the global mean), suggesting a weak influence of urbanization on the local warming over South Korea. Urbanization contribution is assessed using two methods. First, results from ?city minus rural? methods showed that 30?45{\%} of the local warming trends during recent four decades are likely due to the urbanization effect, depending on station classification methods and analysis periods. Results from an ?observation minus reanalysis? method using the Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) data sets (v2 and v2c) indicated about 25?30{\%} contribution of the urbanization effect to the local warming trend during the recent six decades. However, the urbanization contribution was estimated as low as 3?11{\%} when considering the century-long period. Our results confirm large uncertainties in the estimation of urbanization contribution when using shorter-term periods and suggest that the urbanization contribution to the century-long warming trends could be much lower.},

We have examined the simulation performance of regional climate models (RCMs) forced by two global climate models (GCMs) for summer precipitation over Far East Asia and South Korea on the basis of spatial resolution improvement. In terms of model resolution, coarse-resolution RCMs present limitations, whilst high-resolution RCMs offer the added value as revealed by several performance evaluations. RCMs forced by HadGEM2-AO estimated smaller summer precipitation over South Korea than those observed, whereas RCMs forced by MPI-ESM-LR presented a wet bias. Here, moderate-heavy rain in RCMs forced by HadGEM2-AO and light-moderate rain in RCMs forced by MPI-ESM-LR were found to lead to dry and wet biases, respectively.},

abstract = {Abstract. In this work we present downscaling experiments with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to test the sensitivity to resolving aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions on simulated regional climate for the EURO-CORDEX domain. The sensitivities mainly focus on the aerosol–radiation interactions (direct and semi-direct effects) with four different aerosol optical depth datasets (Tegen, MAC-v1, MACC, GOCART) being used and changes to the aerosol absorptivity (single scattering albedo) being examined. Moreover, part of the sensitivities also investigates aerosol–cloud interactions (indirect effect). Simulations have a resolution of 0.44∘ and are forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. A basic evaluation is performed in the context of seasonal-mean comparisons to ground-based (E-OBS) and satellite-based (CM SAF SARAH, CLARA) benchmark observational datasets. The impact of aerosols is calculated by comparing it against a simulation that has no aerosol effects. The implementation of aerosol–radiation interactions reduces the direct component of the incoming surface solar radiation by 20 {\%}–30 {\%} in all seasons, due to enhanced aerosol scattering and absorption. Moreover the aerosol–radiation interactions increase the diffuse component of surface solar radiation in both summer (30 {\%}–40 {\%}) and winter (5 {\%}–8 {\%}), whereas the overall downward solar radiation at the surface is attenuated by 3 {\%}–8 {\%}. The resulting aerosol radiative effect is negative and is comprised of the net effect from the combination of the highly negative direct aerosol effect (−17 to −5 W m−2) and the small positive changes in the cloud radiative effect (+5 W m−2), attributed to the semi-direct effect. The aerosol radiative effect is also stronger in summer (−12 W m−2) than in winter (−2 W m−2). We also show that modelling aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions can lead to small changes in cloudiness, mainly regarding low-level clouds, and circulation anomalies in the lower and mid-troposphere, which in some cases, mainly close to the Black Sea in autumn, can be of statistical significance. Precipitation is not affected in a consistent pattern throughout the year by the aerosol implementation, and changes do not exceed ±5 {\%} except for the case of unrealistically absorbing aerosol. Temperature, on the other hand, systematically decreases by −0.1 to −0.5 ∘C due to aerosol–radiation interactions with regional changes that can be up to −1.5 ∘C.},

Contrary to previous investigations based on shorter records, we demonstrate, using new long-term, quality controlled precipitation series, the lack of statistically significant long-term decreasing trends in precipitation for the region. Rather, significant trends were mostly found for shorter periods, highlighting the prevalence of interdecadal and interannual variability at these time-scales. Global climate model outputs from three CMIP experiments are evaluated for periods concurrent with observations. Both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles show precipitation decline, with only CMIP6 showing agreement with long term trends in observations. However, for both CMIP3 and CMIP5 large interannual and internal variability among ensemble members makes it difficult to identify a trend that is statistically different from observations. Across both observations and models, our results make it difficult to associate any declining trends in precipitation in Southwestern Europe to anthropogenic forcing at this stage.},

abstract = {Parts of Eurasia underlain by large areas of frozen ground that are both sensitive to, and an indicator of, climate change. Previous studies have investigated the effect of climate change on frozen ground; however, those studies did not quantify the past or projected climate change effects for specific frozen ground regions. This study applied surface air temperature from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) data set and the multi-model ensemble mean of 16 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models to evaluate past and projected surface air temperature changes, and quantify changes in different frozen ground regions. Results indicate that CMIP5 can simulate surface air temperature over Eurasia well, and there is slightly better performance of CMIP5 ensemble averages in the late 20th century than in the early 20th century. Over the Eurasian continent, time-series of ensemble area-averaged mean annual air temperatures (MAT) from CMIP5 increased at about 0.074°C decade−1 during 1850−2005, and are projected to increase by 0.078−0.719°C decade−1, depending on future emission pathways, during 2006−2100. Compared to the period 1986−2005, the temperature is predicted to be 1.68−6.41°C higher during 2081−2100. Changes of MAT demonstrate that the fastest increase will occur in continuous permafrost regions, next in discontinuous permafrost regions, followed by sporadic, isolated, and relict permafrost, and finally non-permafrost regions. Overall, these results can be used to help estimate and project cryospheric changes.},

abstract = {Abstract The arid and semiarid northwest China has experienced a significant wetting trend in summer during 1961–2010, but the reasons remain ambiguous. In this study, moisture budget analysis is employed to quantify the contributions of different factors to the wetting trend. The results show that more than 50$\backslash${\%} of the increasing precipitation is balanced by the increased evaporation. The convergence of moisture flux (the sum of horizontal moisture advection and wind convergence terms) has a significant positive contribution to the wetting trend. The increased net surface radiation, which is contributed by the increased downward longwave radiation, supplies more energy to favor the evaporation process of vaporization. The moisture flux convergence is further separated into thermodynamic component in association with changes in specific humidity and dynamic component due to changes in atmospheric circulation. The thermodynamic contribution to the wetting trend is induced by the increased specific humidity which is associated with enhanced evaporation. The dynamic contribution is dominated by an anomalous cyclone over central Asia. The anomalous cyclone is related with intensified horizontal vorticity advection which is associated with a significant southward displacement of Asian subtropical westerly jet. The results indicate that the changes of evaporation against the background of global warming deserve more attention in projecting the climate change in arid and semiarid regions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In many regions of Mexico, precipitation occurs in a very well defined annual cycle, with peaks in May–June and September–October and a relative minimum in the middle. This minimum in the middle of the rainy season is known as the midsummer drought (MSD) and impacts agriculture and industry. However, in Mexico there are large areas with either sparse meteorological station coverage or where time series of historical observations have many missing data, which make it difficult to study and analyse the precipitation variability at different scales of space and time. Therefore, the most important objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the recently available Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) product in estimating the duration and intensity of the MSD in Mexico, taking advantage of its very fine spatial resolution (0.05°) and continuous coverage to improve on current understanding of the MSD. In order to achieve this, MSD duration and intensity are calculated from the CHIRPS data and then compared to gauge data for the 1981–2010 period. In addition, two new indices for estimating the intensity of the MSD are defined, and these new indices provide complementary information to that obtained with more traditional methods. Results show that CHIRPS overestimates (underestimates) precipitation in Mexico during summer and autumn (winter and spring) seasons by up to 30{\%}. Most importantly, by using CHIRPS and the two new indices proposed, the most detailed spatial representation ever of the MSD in Mexico has been obtained through the elimination of spatial and temporal coverage gaps.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first multi-model ensemble of 10-year, kilometer-scale regional climate model scenario simulations downscaled from selected CMIP5 GCM projections over historical and end of century time slices. The technique is to first downscale the CMIP5 GCM projections to an intermediate 12-25 km resolution using regional models, then these are used to downscale further to kilometer scale. The aim is to provide an overview of projected precipitation changes over the greater Alpine domain within a Coordinated Regional Climate downscaling Experiment Flagship Pilot Study (CORDEX-FPS) tasked with investigating convective processes at the kilometer scale. An ensemble of 12 simulations, performed by different research groups around Europe, is analysed. The key characteristic of the model members of the ensemble is to work at a resolution allowing for explicit treatment of convective processes ({\~{}}3km). The simulations are evaluated through comparison with high resolution observations while the complementary ensemble of 12-25 km resolution driving models is used as a benchmark to evaluate the added value of “convection-permitting” ensemble. The results show that the kilometer-scale ensemble is able to improve the representation of fine scale details of mean daily, wet-day/hour frequency, wet- day/hour intensity and heavy precipitation on a seasonal scale. It also improves the onset and peak of the summer diurnal convection. The kilometer-scale ensemble refines and enhances the projected patterns of change from coarser resolution simulations and even modifies the sign of the daily precipitation intensity change and heavy precipitation over some regions. They also show a bigger amplitude of change for the diurnal cycle for mean, intensity, frequency and extreme and a larger positive change for high to extreme events for both daily and hourly precipitation distribution. The results are encouraging and the use of such ensembles at the convection resolving scale represents an exciting way forward for robust assessment of the local impacts of future climate change.},

abstract = {The study focuses on the analysis of extreme precipitation events of the present and future climate over southern Africa. Parametric and non-parametric approaches are used to identify and analyse these extreme events in data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) models. The performance of the global climate model (GCM) forced regional climate model (RCM) simulations shows that the models are able to capture the observed climatological spatial patterns of the extreme precipitation. It is also shown that the downscaling of the present climate are able to add value to the performance of GCMs over some areas depending on the metric used. The added value over GCMs justifies the additional computational effort of RCM simulation for the generation of relevant climate information for regional application. In the climate projections for the end of twenty-first Century (2069–2098) relative to the reference period (1976–2005), annual total precipitation is projected to decrease while the maximum number of consecutive dry days increases. Maximum 5-day precipitation amounts and 95th percentile of precipitation are also projected to increase significantly in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of southern Africa and decrease in the extra-tropical region. There are indications that rainfall intensity is likely to increase. This does not equate to an increase in total rainfall, but suggests that when it does rain, the intensity is likely to be greater. These changes are magnified under the RCP8.5 when compared with the RCP4.5 and are consistent with previous studies based on GCMs over the region.},

abstract = {Decision-scale relevant climate information on climate change is needed to inform policy and decision making but often involves high uncertainty. To enhance confidence in interpreting regional climate projections, it is important to understand the underlying physical processes driving the change. This study explores a methodology to investigate climate change as a function of changes in frequency of synoptic circulation. The approach examines how dynamically downscaled future climate from two regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), driven with four general circulation models (GCMs), can give rise to surface climate changes that differ from those of the driving GCMs. The study focuses on changes in precipitation and the circulation processes driving the projected changes from the regional climate simulations. Despite uncertainty in future projections, the RCMs and GCMs both show decreases in precipitation over most of southern Africa and suggest a reduction (increase) in the frequency of circulation patterns associated with precipitation (no precipitation) over the region. However, some contradictions are seen in the centre of the domain for some ensemble members. This study shows that some of this disagreement in precipitation projections between GCMs and RCMs is due to the inconsistencies in the physical parameterizations of precipitation processes rather than inconsistences in regional-scale circulation patterns.},

abstract = {Climate change is amplified in the Arctic region. Arctic amplification has been found in past warm and glacial periods, as well as in historical observations and climate model experiments. Feedback effects associated with temperature, water vapour and clouds have been suggested to contribute to amplified warming in the Arctic, but the surface albedo feedback - the increase in surface absorption of solar radiation when snow and ice retreat - is often cited as the main contributor. However, Arctic amplification is also found in models without changes in snow and ice cover. Here we analyse climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive to quantify the contributions of the various feedbacks. We find that in the simulations, the largest contribution to Arctic amplification comes from a temperature feedbacks: as the surface warms, more energy is radiated back to space in low latitudes, compared with the Arctic. This effect can be attributed to both the different vertical structure of the warming in high and low latitudes, and a smaller increase in emitted blackbody radiation per unit warming at colder temperatures. We find that the surface albedo feedback is the second main contributor to Arctic amplification and that other contributions are substantially smaller or even opposeArctic amplification. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Extratropical Cyclone (EC) characteristics depend on a combination of large-scale factors and regional processes. However, the latter are considered to be poorly represented in global climate models (GCMs), partly because their resolution is too coarse. This paper describes a framework using possibilities given by regional climate models (RCMs) to gain insight into storm activity during winter over North America (NA). Recent past climate period (1981--2005) is considered to assess EC activity over NA using the NCEP regional reanalysis (NARR) as a reference, along with the European reanalysis ERA-Interim (ERAI) and two CMIP5 GCMs used to drive the Canadian Regional Climate Model---version 5 (CRCM5) and the corresponding regional-scale simulations. While ERAI and GCM simulations show basic agreement with NARR in terms of climatological storm track patterns, detailed bias analyses show that, on the one hand, ERAI presents statistically significant positive biases in terms of EC genesis and therefore occurrence while capturing their intensity fairly well. On the other hand, GCMs present large negative intensity biases in the overall NA domain and particularly over NA eastern coast. In addition, storm occurrence over the northwestern topographic regions is highly overestimated. When the CRCM5 is driven by ERAI, no significant skill deterioration arises and, more importantly, all storm characteristics near areas with marked relief and over regions with large water masses are significantly improved with respect to ERAI. Conversely, in GCM-driven simulations, the added value contributed by CRCM5 is less prominent and systematic, except over western NA areas with high topography and over the Western Atlantic coastlines where the most frequent and intense ECs are located. Despite this significant added-value on seasonal-mean characteristics, a caveat is raised on the RCM ability to handle storm temporal `seriality', as a measure of their temporal variability at a given location. In fact, the driving models induce some significant footprints on the RCM skill to reproduce the intra-seasonal pattern of storm activity.},

The reanalysis is single-member, and the background errors are spatiotemporally varying, derived from an ensemble. The atmospheric general circulation model uses the same configuration as the control member of the ERA-20CM ensemble, forced by observationally based analyses of sea surface temperature, sea ice cover, atmospheric composition changes, and solar forcing. The resulting climate trend estimations resemble ERA-20CM for temperature and the water cycle. The ERA-20C water cycle features stable precipitation minus evaporation global averages and no spurious jumps or trends. The assimilation of observations adds realism on synoptic time scales as compared to ERA-20CM in regions that are sufficiently well observed. Comparing to nighttime ship observations, ERA-20C air temperatures are 1 K colder. Generally, the synoptic quality of the product and the agreement in terms of climate indices with other products improve with the availability of observations. The MJO mean amplitude in ERA-20C is larger than in 20CR version 2c throughout the century, and in agreement with other reanalyses such as JRA-55.

abstract = {Groundwater on islands occurs in the form of freshwater lenses that serve as an important water resource for local inhabitants. These lenses are highly vulnerable to salinization due to natural recharge variations and groundwater abstraction. Determining the sustainable yield from freshwater lenses is challenging because the lens response during drought periods and the long-term effects of pumping are both difficult to predict. The exceptionally detailed and long data record for Bonriki Island of the Tarawa atoll (Kiribati) made it possible to develop a three-dimensional variable-density model of the island. Field data and modelling results highlight the strong control of rainfall variability and pumping on the temporal dynamics of the freshwater lens. The model reproduces the salinity observations in both monitoring and pumping wells reasonably well, and provides a rare example of physically based island simulation based on an extensive data set. It enables the analysis of freshwater volume and fluxes of submarine groundwater discharge, which is impossible based on the field observations alone. Under natural as well as abstraction conditions, submarine groundwater discharge responds rapidly and almost proportionally to recharge. Theoretical model scenarios with scaled abstraction rates show that lens contraction caused by pumping is a nearly linear function of the total pumped volume, whereby the abstraction rate and the timing of depletion are approximately inversely proportional. Modelling indicates that when monthly recharge inputs fall below around 2500 m3/d (i.e., a flux of 1.7 mm/d) plus the abstraction rate, the lens tends to contract. Thus, despite the highly distributed and extensive abstraction network on Bonriki Island, a significant amount of recharge is eventually lost to submarine groundwater discharge. The long-term freshwater storage trend indicates that Bonriki Island's lens is still contracting after 27.5 years of pumping, and lens thinning is threatening to impact the water supply salinity. This means that even permeable, small islands like Bonriki may take at least two decades to realise new equilibrium conditions that reflect pumping stresses, which is an important consideration in assessing the sustainable yield of small islands, in particular those less resilient to pumping than Bonriki. {\textcopyright} 2018},

abstract = {Accurate long-term estimates of precipitation at fine spatiotemporal resolution are vital for several applications ranging from hydrometeorology to climatology. The availability of a good network of rain gauges, and high precipitation variability associated with two annual monsoon systems and complex topography make India a suitable test-bed to assess the performance of any satellite-based precipitation product. This study assesses the performance of latest versions of four multi-satellite precipitation products: (i) Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), (ii) Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), (iii) SM2RAIN-Climate Change Initiative (SM2RAIN-CCI), and (iv) TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) across India using gauge-based observations for the period of 1998–2015 at monthly scale. These four multi-satellite precipitation products are essentially based on different algorithms and input data sets. Among these multi-satellite precipitation products, SM2RAIN-CCI is the only product that does not use rain gauge observations for bias adjustment. Results indicate that CHIRPS and TMPA are comparable to gauge-based precipitation estimates at all-India and sub-regional scales followed by MSWEP estimates. However, SM2RAIN-CCI largely underestimates precipitation across the country as compared to gauge-based observations. The systematic error component in SM2RAIN-CCI dominates as compared to random error component, which suggests the need of a suitable bias correction to SM2RAIN-CCI before integrating it in any application. The overall results indicate that CHIRPS data set could be used for long-term precipitation analyses with rather higher confidence.},

In this paper, two successive versions of the TMPA-3B42 research monitoring product, version 6 (V6) and V7, at the daily scale are evaluated over India during the southwest monsoon with gauge-based data for a 13-yr (1998–2010) period. Over typical monsoon rainfall zones, biases are improved by 5{\%}–10{\%} in V7 over the regions of higher rainfall like the west coast, northeastern, and central India. A similar reduced bias is seen in V7 over the rain-shadow region located in southeastern India. In terms of correlation, anomaly correlation, and RMSE, a marginal improvement is seen in V7. Additionally, in all-India summer monsoon rainfall amounts, mean, interannual values, and standard deviation show an overall improvement in V7. Different skill metrics over typical subregions within India show an improvement of the monsoon rainfall represe...},

abstract = {Gridded precipitation data sets are frequently used to evaluate climate models or to remove model output biases. Although precipitation data are error prone due to the high spatio‐temporal variability of precipitation and due to considerable measurement errors, relatively few attempts have been made to account for observational uncertainty in model evaluation or in bias correction studies. In this study, we compare three types of European daily data sets featuring two Pan‐European data sets and a set that combines eight very high‐resolution station‐based regional data sets. Furthermore, we investigate seven widely used, larger scale global data sets. Our results demonstrate that the differences between these data sets have the same magnitude as precipitation errors found in regional climate models. Therefore, including observational uncertainties is essential for climate studies, climate model evaluation, and statistical post‐processing. Following our results, we suggest the following guidelines for regional precipitation assessments. (1) Include multiple observational data sets from different sources (e.g. station, satellite, reanalysis based) to estimate observational uncertainties. (2) Use data sets with high station densities to minimize the effect of precipitation undersampling (may induce about 60{\%} error in data sparse regions). The information content of a gridded data set is mainly related to its underlying station density and not to its grid spacing. (3) Consider undercatch errors of up to 80{\%} in high latitudes and mountainous regions. (4) Analyses of small‐scale features and extremes are especially uncertain in gridded data sets. For higher confidence, use climate‐mean and larger scale statistics. In conclusion, neglecting observational uncertainties potentially misguides climate model development and can severely affect the results of climate change impact assessments.},

abstract = {Regional climate models (RCMs) are able to simulate small-scale processes that are missing in their coarser resolution driving data and thereby provide valuable climate information for climate impact assessments. Less attention has been paid to the ability of RCMs to capture large-scale weather types (WTs). An inaccurate representation of WTs can result in biases and uncertainties in current and future climate simulations that cannot be easily detected by standard model evaluation metrics. Here we define 12 hydrologically important WTs in the contiguous United States (CONUS). We test if RCMs from the North American CORDEX (NA-CORDEX) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model large physics ensembles (WRF36) can capture those WTs in the current climate and how they simulate changes in the future. Our results show that the NA-CORDEX RCMs are able to simulate WTs more accurately than members of the WRF36 ensemble. The much larger WRF36 domain in combination with not constraining large-scale conditions by spectral nudging results in lower WT skill. The selection of the driving global climate model (GCM) has a large effect on the skill of NA-CORDEX simulations but a smaller impact on the WRF36 runs. The formulation of the RCM is of minor importance except for capturing the variability within WTs. Changing the model physics or increasing the RCM horizontal grid spacing has little effect. These results highlight the importance of selecting GCMs with accurate synoptic-scale variability for downscaling and to find a balance between large domains that can result in biased WT representations and small domains that inhibit the realistic development of mesoscale processes. At the end of the century, monsoonal flow conditions increase systematically by up to 30{\%} and a WT that is a significant source of moisture for the Northern Plains during the growing seasons decreases systematically up to –30{\%}.},

A storm-tracking algorithm6indicates that intense summertime MCS frequency will more than triple in North America. Furthermore, the combined effect of a 15–40{\%} increase in maximum precipitation rates and a significant spreading of regions impacted by heavy precipitation results in up to 80{\%} increases in the total MCS precipitation volume, focussed in a 40 km radius around the storm centre.

abstract = {Global and regional climate models robustly simulate increases in Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in response to anthropogenic global warming. Despite these robust model projections, however, observations indicate that there has been no significant change in Antarctic SMB in recent decades. We show that this apparent discrepancy between models and observations can be explained by the fact that the anthropogenic climate change signal during the second half of the twentieth century is small compared to the noise associated with natural climate variability. Using an ensemble of 35 global coupled climate models to separate signal and noise, we find that the forced SMB increase due to global warming in recent decades is unlikely to be detectable as a result of large natural SMB variability. However, our analysis reveals that the anthropogenic impact on Antarctic SMB is very likely to emerge from natural variability by the middle of the current century, thus mitigating future increases in global sea level.},

Two kinds of air temperature data (observational and reanalysis) have been used in the research. The observational data were compared with data taken from six reanalysis products (20CRv2c, CERA-20C, ERA-Int, MERRA-2, NCEP-CFSRR, JRA-55). The scale of the HA warming for the period 1996–2015 relative to the reference period 1951–1990 reached 1.6 °C for annual mean and was greatest in autumn (1.9 °C) and in winter (1.7 °C), while it was smallest in summer (0.9 °C). Evidently, the greatest warming was observed in the Atlantic and Siberian climatic regions, while in the rest of the HA, the rate of warming was usually weaker than trends calculated for the period 1976–2015. Air temperature tendencies in all study periods 1951–2015, 1976–2015 and 1996–2015 showed a predominance of positive trends that were statistically significant at the level of 0.05. In the two latter periods, the rate of warming was on average 2–3 times faster than for the entire study period. In the HA, there has not been a slowdown in the rate of warming (“hiatus”) in the last two decades (in contrast to that which was noted for the Northern Hemisphere). Our results reveal that, in most cases, the closest fit to observations was obtained for two reanalysis products (the ERA-Interim and JRA-55, since 1979) and the six reanalysis average. Two new polar amplification (PA) metrics based on scaled and standardised values of surface air temperature (SAT) reveal the non-existence of this phenomenon in the period 1951–2015. One of the metrics shows very small PA in the periods 1976–2015 and 1996–2015.},

These changes in snow cover affect Earth's climate system via the surface energy budget, and influence freshwater resources across a large proportion of the Northern Hemisphere4–6. In contrast to snow extent, reliable quantitative knowledge on seasonal snow mass and its trend is lacking7–9. Here we use the new GlobSnow 3.0 dataset to show that the 1980–2018 annual maximum snow mass in the Northern Hemisphere was, on average, 3,062 ± 35 billion tonnes (gigatonnes). Our quantification is for March (the month that most closely corresponds to peak snow mass), covers non-alpine regions above 40° N and, crucially, includes a bias correction based on in-field snow observations. We compare our GlobSnow 3.0 estimates with three independent estimates of snow mass, each with and without the bias correction. Across the four datasets, the bias correction decreased the range from 2,433–3,380 gigatonnes (mean 2,867) to 2,846–3,062 gigatonnes (mean 2,938)—a reduction in uncertainty from 33{\%} to 7.4{\%}. On the basis of our bias-corrected GlobSnow 3.0 estimates, we find different continental trends over the 39-year satellite record. For example, snow mass decreased by 46 gigatonnes per decade across North America but had a negligible trend across Eurasia; both continents exhibit high regional variability. Our results enable a better estimation of the role of seasonal snow mass in Earth's energy, water and carbon budgets.},

abstract = {Abstract. Four high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs) have been set up for the area of Greenland, with the aim of providing future projections of Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance (SMB), and its contribution to sea level rise, with greater accuracy than is possible from coarser-resolution general circulation models (GCMs). This is the first time an intercomparison has been carried out of RCM results for Greenland climate and SMB. Output from RCM simulations for the recent past with the four RCMs is evaluated against available observations. The evaluation highlights the importance of using a detailed snow physics scheme, especially regarding the representations of albedo and meltwater refreezing. Simulations with three of the RCMs for the 21st century using SRES scenario A1B from two GCMs produce trends of between −5.5 and −1.1 Gt yr−2 in SMB (equivalent to +0.015 and +0.003 mm sea level equivalent yr−2), with trends of smaller magnitude for scenario E1, in which emissions are mitigated. Results from one of the RCMs whose present-day simulation is most realistic indicate that an annual mean near-surface air temperature increase over Greenland of {\~{}} 2°C would be required for the mass loss to increase such that it exceeds accumulation, thereby causing the SMB to become negative, which has been suggested as a threshold beyond which the ice sheet would eventually be eliminated.},

In addition to this natural dryness, recent global climate change has also affected precipitation in different parts of Iran in terms of both mean and extreme amounts. Precipitation extremes can have many negative effects on different parts of the Earth's ecosystems. The possible pattern of precipitation trends during recent years merits further study given the potentially important impacts on agriculture and water resources in Iran. Globally, observations show significant changes in the characteristics of extreme precipitation. To study recent trends in mean and extreme precipitation events in Iran, we examined a number of mean and extreme precipitation indices for a 58-year period (1960–2017) for 33 synoptic stations throughout the country. Daily precipitation data were collected from the Iranian Meteorological Organization for this period for all stations. Nine precipitation-based indices (one mean and eight extreme) were employed to study precipitation trends. The results showed that most areas have undergone a significant increasing trend in extreme precipitation values, precipitation intensity, and precipitation frequency. Significant positive trends were seen in the southwestern regions of Iran and the coasts of the Persian Gulf for the same precipitation indices. The results of this study could be used by managers and experts for long-term planning.},

The results showed that all the satellite products had low accuracy because of spatial scale effect, daily resolution and the island complexity. That accuracy was relatively lower in (i) dry seasons and dry climatic zones than in wet seasons and wet climatic zones; (ii) pixels jointly covered by sea and mountainous land than in pixels covered by land or by sea only; and (iii) topographically diverse than uniform terrains. CMORPH25, CMORPH8, and TRMM underestimated and PERSIANN overestimated rainfall when comparing them to gauged rain. The CMORPH25 had relatively the best performance and the PERSIANN had the worst performance in the Bali Island. The CMORPH25 had the lowest statistical errors, the lowest miss, and the highest hit rainfall events; it also had the lowest miss rainfall bias and was relatively the most accurate in detecting, frequent in Bali, ≤ 20 mm day−1 rain events.

abstract = {Black carbon in soot is the dominant absorber of visible solar radiation in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic sources of black carbon, although distributed globally, are most concentrated in the tropics where solar irradiance is highest. Black carbon is often transported over long distances, mixing with other aerosols along the way. The aerosol mix can form transcontinental plumes of atmospheric brown clouds, with vertical extents of 3 to 5 km. Because of the combination of high absorption, a regional distribution roughly aligned with solar irradiance, and the capacity to form widespread atmospheric brown clouds in a mixture with other aerosols, emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions. In the Himalayan region, solar heating from black carbon at high elevations may be just as important as carbon dioxide in the melting of snowpacks and glaciers. The interception of solar radiation by atmospheric brown clouds leads to dimming at the Earth's surface with important implications for the hydrological cycle, and the deposition of black carbon darkens snow and ice surfaces, which can contribute to melting, in particular of Arctic sea ice. {\textcopyright} 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

It presents the first annual cycle of aerosol observations and forcing from the ABC observatories in the Indo-Asia-Pacific regions. East Asia, Indo-Gangetic Plains, Indonesian region, southern Africa and the Amazon basin are the regional hot spots defted by the criteria that anthropogenic aerosol optical depths (AODs) should exceed 0.3 and absorbing AOD {\textgreater} 0.03. Over these 3 hot spots, as well as in other polluted oceanic regions, the EC mass exceeds 0.5 $\mu$g m-3, the OC mass exceeds 2 $\mu$g m-3 and sulfate mass exceeds 10 $\mu$g m-3 from the surface to 3 km. The brown clouds also have strong seasonal dependence. In the tropics the seasonal dependence is driven by pollution accumulating during the dry seasons, December to February in Northern Hemisphere tropics and June to August in Southern Hemisphere tropics. In the extratropics the pollution peaks during the summer. The brown cloud problem is not restricted to the tropical regions. Over the eastern half of US and western Europe the AODs exceeds 0.2 and absorption AODs exceed 0.02. Brown clouds also extend well into the western Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean reaching as far south as 60°S and the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The largest total SO2 emission occurs over China and US, while SO2 emission per unit surface area is maximum over Germany and England. The largest total EC and OC emissions occur over China, but the largest OC emission per unit surface area occur over India. As a result, the maximum negative annual mean TOA direct forcing is over India and Germany. The surface annual-diurnal mean dimming over the regional hot spots is of the order of -10 W m-2 and -20 W m-2 over megacity hotpots. Copyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.},

An assessment of P/PET estimated using the ensemble mean precipitation shows an increase in aridity over several semiarid regions of India, despite the sensitivity of P/PET variations across individual precipitation data sets. Our results indicate that precipitation variations over the semiarid regions of India are outpacing the changes in potential evapotranspiration and, thereby, influencing aridity changes in a significant manner. Our results further reveal a 10{\%} expansion in the area of the semiarid regions during recent decades relative to previous decades, thus highlighting the need for better adaptation strategies and mitigation planning for the semiarid regions in India. The sensitivity of aridity index to multiple PET data sets can be an additional source of uncertainty and will be addressed in a future study.},

abstract = {Two ensembles of climate simulations, one global and one regional, are used to investigate model errors and projected climate change in seasonal mean temperature and precipitation over South Asia. The global ensemble includes ten global climate models (GCMs). In the regional ensemble all ten GCMs are downscaled by a regional climate model—RCA4 over South Asia at 50 km resolution. Our focus is on the Indian Summer Monsoon season (June–August) and we show that RCA4 can reproduce, reduce or amplify large-scale GCM biases depending on regions and GCMs. However, the RCA4 bias pattern in precipitation is similar across the simulations, regardless of forcing GCM, indicating a strong RCA4 imprint on the simulated precipitation. For climate change, the results indicate, that RCA4 can change the signal projected by the GCM ensemble and its individual members. There are a few RCA4 simulations with a substantial reduction of projected warming by RCA4 compared to the driving GCMs and with a large regional increase in precipitation absent in the GCMs. We also found that in a number of subregions warm RCA4 biases are related to stronger warming and vice versa, while there is no such dependency in the GCM ensemble. Neither the GCM nor the RCA4 ensemble shows any significant dependency between projected changes and biases for precipitation. Our results implicate that using only RCMs and excluding GCMs, a commonly established approach, can significantly change the message on future regional climate change.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal consistency of seasonal air temperature and precipitation in eight widely used gridded observation-based climate datasets (CANGRD, CRU-TS3.1, CRUTEM4.1, GISTEMP, GPCC, GPCP, HadCRUT3, and UDEL) and eight reanalyses (20CR, CFSR, ERA-40, ERA-Interim, JRA25, MERRA, NARR, and NCEP2) was evaluated over the Canadian Arctic for the 1950–2010 period. The evaluation used the CANGRD dataset, which is based on homogenized temperature and adjusted precipitation from climate stations, as a reference. Dataset agreement and bias were observed to exhibit important spatial, seasonal, and tem- poral variability over the Canadian Arctic with the largest spread occurring between datasets over mountain and coastal regions and over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Reanalysis datasets were typically warmer and wetter than surface observation-based datasets, with CFSR and 20CR exhibiting biases in total annual precipitation on the order of 300 mm. Warm bias in 20CR exceeded 12°C in winter over the western Arctic. Analysis of the temporal consistency of datasets over the 1950–2010 period showed evidence of discontinuities in several datasets as well as a noticeable increase in dataset spread in the period after approximately 2000. Declining station networks, increased automation, and the inclusion of new satellite data streams in reanalyses are potential contributing factors to this phenomenon. Evaluation of trends over the 1950–2010 period showed a relatively consistent picture of warming and increased precipitation over the Canadian Arctic from all datasets, with CANGRD giving moistening trends two times larger than the multi-dataset average related to the adjustment of the station precipitation data. The study results indicate that considerable care is needed when using gridded climate datasets in local or regional scale applications in the Canadian Arctic.},

abstract = { AbstractA high-resolution climate model (4-km horizontal grid spacing) is used to examine the following question: How will long-term changes in climate impact the partitioning of annual precipitation between evapotranspiration and runoff in the Colorado Headwaters?This question is examined using a climate sensitivity approach in which eight years of current climate is compared to a future climate created by modifying the current climate signal with perturbation from the NCAR Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3), model forced by the A1B scenario for greenhouse gases out to 2050. The current climate period is shown to agree well with Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) surface observations of precipitation (P) and snowpack, as well as streamflow and AmeriFlux evapotranspiration (ET) observations. The results show that the annual evaporative fraction (ET/P) for the Colorado Headwaters is 0.81 for the current climate and 0.83 for the future climate, indicating increasing aridity in the future despite a positive increase of precipitation. Runoff decreased by an average of 6{\%}, reflecting the increased aridity.Precipitation increased in the future winter by 12{\%}, but decreased in the summer as a result of increased low-level inhibition to convection. The fraction of precipitation that fell as snow decreased from 0.83 in the current climate to 0.74 in the future. Future snowpack did not change significantly until January. From January to March the snowpack increased above {\~{}}3000 m MSL and decreased below that level. Snowpack decreased at all elevations in the future from April to July. The peak snowpack and runoff over the headwaters occurred 2–3 weeks earlier in the future simulation, in agreement with previous studies. },

abstract = {Cool-season (April to October) rainfall dominates the annual average rainfall over Victoria, Australia, and is important for agriculture and replenishing reservoirs. Rainfall during the cool season has been unusually low since the beginning of the Millennium Drought in 1997 ({\~{}}12{\%} below the twentieth-century average). In this study, 24 CMIP5 climate models are used to estimate 1) the extent to which this drying is driven by external forcing and 2) future rainfall, taking both external forcing and internal natural climate variability into account. All models have preindustrial, historical, and twenty-first-century (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) simulations. It is found that rainfall in the past two decades is below the preindustrial average in two-thirds or more of model simulations. However, the magnitude of the multimodel median externally forced drying is equivalent to only 20{\%} of the observed drying (interquartile range of 40{\%} to −4{\%}), suggesting that the drying is dominated by internally generated rainfall variability. Underestimation of internal variability of rainfall by the models, however, increases the uncertainties in these estimates. According to models the anthropogenically forced drying becomes dominant from 2010 to 2029, when drying is evident in over 90{\%} of the model simulations. For the 2018–37 period, it is found that there is only a {\~{}}12{\%} chance that internal rainfall variability could completely offset the anthropogenically forced drying. By the late twenty-first century, the anthropogenically forced drying under RCP8.5 is so large that internal variability appears too small to be able to offset it. Confidence in the projections is lowered because models have difficulty in simulating the magnitude of the observed decline in rainfall.},

In addition, a precipitation increase over southeastern SA is projected, mainly during summer and spring.

In the near-future, the projections show a slight delay (one pentad) of the beginning of the rainy season, resulting in a small reduction of the SAM length.

abstract = {Changes in the characteristics of austral winter (June–July–August) synoptic activity in three domains (Africa, Australia and South America) of the extratropical Southern Hemisphere projected with the Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) are presented. The model is nested in three global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. The model grid spacing is 25 km and the simulations cover the period 1970–2100. Synoptic activity is analyzed using both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. The Eulerian analysis shows an increase of the synoptic activity south of 40° S in the RegCM4 and GCMs ensembles for the future (2080–2099) compared to the present (1995–2014), but this signal does not necessarily indicate an increase in the cyclone frequency since it includes cyclonic and anticyclonic features. The Lagrangian analysis, however, indicates a decrease in the frequency of cyclones, with a positive tendency towards stronger systems, although the latter is not statistically significant at 95{\%} confidence level. Lifetime, traveled distance and mean speed of the cyclones do not present statistically significant changes in the future climate. On the other hand, a significant increase in both intensity and extension of areas affected by precipitation associated with cyclones is found. As a consequence, there is a statistically significant trend of individual cyclones to produce more rainfall in the future.},

The results show that the multimodel ensemble mean (MME) simulation has good ability to model the interannual variability of the WNPSH, EAJ and EASR, although some discrepancy exists among the individual models. The MME simulation can also reasonably capture the observed relationship of the EASR with the WNPSH and the EAJ. Under the RCP4.5 and the RCP8.5 scenarios, the interannual variability in WNPSH, EAJ and EASR is projected by the MME to increase in the 21st century. In addition, the WNPSH and EAJ would still be the dominant systems influencing the East Asian summer precipitation under global warming scenarios. But the linkage of the EASR to the WNPSH may be slightly weaker and that to the EAJ may be slightly stronger in the 21st century as compared to the present.},

abstract = {Antarctica is among the most important regions when it comes to observing the effects of climate change. One important part of the variability of the land surface temperature (LST) observed on this continent is related to the sea surface temperature of the Tropical Pacific Ocean, which is associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This large-scale phenomenon is called tele-connection. In this study, we investigate the recent trends of LST in Antarctica over the last few decades and its relationship with one of the most intense El Ni{\~{n}}o events in 2015–2016. LST anomalies derived from satellite data (MODIS) and skin temperature from re-analysis (ERA-5 and ERA-Interim) were used, in addition to the Oceanic Ni{\~{n}}o Index (ONI) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) time series. A non-parametric time series analysis was carried out to estimate LST trends over different zones of Antarctica. The results show a warming trend obtained from ERA-5 of about 0.9 K/decade in the interior of Antarctica, while MODIS showed the lowest temperature trends of −1 K/decade in East Antarctica. The analysis between LST and the SAM index shows a negative relationship in the extreme periods of ENSO 2015–2016, showing colder autumns and warmer springs than in previous years. These results aide in understanding the effects of extreme phases of ENSO on Antarctica, which are of great importance given the projection of more intense phases over the next century as foreseen in future scenarios of climate change.},

abstract = {This paper synthesizes what is known about the physical and biophysical impacts of climate change and their consequences for societies and development under different levels of global warming in Central Asia. Projections show mean temperatures increasing by up to 6.5 °C compared to pre-industrial by the end of this century across the region. Associated physical impacts include altered precipitation regimes, more frequent heat extremes and increasing aridity. Increasing rates of glacial and snow melt could lead to greater river runoff, but also to greater seasonality of runoff in the short term and to decreasing water availability in the medium term to long term. These changes have negative implications for the water availability in the region and for conflicting water demands between agriculture and hydropower. Climate change could mostly decrease crop yields, challenging food security, but in more northern regions there could also be positive effects. Studies on climate change impacts on energy systems are scarce and yield conflicting results, but the more regional study shows decreasing prospects for hydropower. The health of the population is already sensitive to heat extremes and is projected to be exposed to more frequent and prolonged heat waves in the future, among other potential health impacts. While the evidence for a link between climate and migration is weak, the rural-to-urban migration can be especially expected to intensify. The paper concludes that Central Asia will be severely affected by climate change even if the global mean temperature increase is limited to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, due to the potential for impacts to occur simultaneously and compound one another as well as interactions with wider development challenges, while risks will be strongly amplified if this threshold is crossed.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will continue to diminish the unique role that mountains perform as natural reservoirs and alter long-held assumptions of water management. Climate models are important tools to help constrain uncertainty and understand processes that shape this decline. To ensure that climate model estimates provide stakeholder relevant information, the formulation of multimetric model evaluation frameworks informed by stakeholder interactions are critical. In this study, we present one such multimetric framework to evaluate snowpack data sets in the California Sierra Nevada: the snow water equivalent (SWE) triangle. SWE triangle metrics help to describe snowpack characteristics associated with total water volume buildup, peak water availability, and the rate of water release. This approach highlights compensating errors that would not be reflected in conventional large-scale spatiotemporal analysis. To test our multimetric evaluation framework, we evaluate several publicly available snow products including the Sierra Nevada Snow Reanalysis, Livneh (L15), and the North American Land Data Assimilation System version 2 data sets. We then evaluate regional climate model skill within the North American Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment. All data sets analyzed show variation across the various SWE triangle metrics, even within observationally constrained snow products. This spread was especially shown in spring season melt rates. Melt rate biases were prevalent throughout most regional climate model simulations, regardless of snow accumulation dynamics, and will need to be addressed to improve their utility for water stakeholders.},

abstract = {This study aims in filling the gap in understanding the relationship between trend and extreme in diurnal and nocturnal temperatures (Tx and Tn) over the Gulf of Guinea area and the Sahel. Time-evolution and trend of Tx and Tn anomalies, extreme temperatures and heat waves are examined using regional and station-based indices over the 1900-2012 and 1950-2012 periods respectively. In investigating extreme temperature anomalies and heat waves, a percentile method is used. At the regional and local scales, rising trends in Tx and Tn anomalies, which appear more pronounced over the past 60. years, are identified over the two regions. The trends are characterized by an intensification of: i) nocturnal/Tn warming over the second half of the 20th century; and ii) diurnal/Tx warming over the post-1980s. This is the same scheme with extreme warm days and warm nights. Finally annual number of diurnal and nocturnal heat waves has increase over the Gulf of Guinea coastal regions over the second half of the 20th century, and even more substantially over the post-1980s period. Although this trend in extreme warm days and nights is always overestimated in the simulations, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), those models display rising trends whatever the scenario, which are likely to be more and more pronounced over the two regions in the next 50. years.},

abstract = {Northern latitudes are experiencing faster warming than other regions in the world, which is partly explained by the snow albedo feedback. In Norway, mean temperatures have been increasing since the 1990s, with 2014 being the warmest year on record, 2.2 C above normal (1961–1990). At the same time, a concurrent reduction in the land area covered by snow has been reported. In this study, we present a detailed spatial and temporal (monthly and seasonal) analysis of trends and changes in snow indices based on a high resolution (1 km) gridded hydro-meteorological dataset for Norway (seNorge). During the period 1961–2010, snow cover extent (SCE) was found to decrease, notably at the end of the snow season, with a corresponding decrease in snow water equivalent except at high elevations. SCE for all Norway decreased by more than 20,000 km2 (6{\%} of the land area) between the periods 1961–1990 and 1981–2010, mainly North of 63 N. Overall, air temperature increased in all seasons, with the highest increase in spring (particularly in April) and winter. Mean monthly air temperatures were significantly correlated with the monthly SCE, suggesting a positive land–atmosphere feedback enhancing warming in winter and spring.},

Here, we present a high-level evaluation of Antarctic sea ice in 40 models from the most recent phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Many models capture key characteristics of the mean seasonal cycle of sea ice area (SIA), but some simulate implausible historical mean states compared to satellite observations, leading to large intermodel spread. Summer SIA is consistently biased low across the ensemble. Compared to the previous model generation (CMIP5), the intermodel spread in winter and summer SIA has reduced, and the regional distribution of sea ice concentration has improved. Over 1979–2018, many models simulate strong negative trends in SIA concurrently with stronger-than-observed trends in global mean surface temperature (GMST). By the end of the 21st century, models project clear differences in sea ice between forcing scenarios.},

@article{Roberts2018,
abstract = {The time scales of the Paris Climate Agreement indicate urgent action is required on climate policies over the next few decades, in order to avoid the worst risks posed by climate change. On these relatively short time scales the combined effect of climate variability and change are both key drivers of extreme events, with decadal time scales also important for infrastructure planning. Hence, in order to assess climate risk on such time scales, we require climate models to be able to represent key aspects of both internally driven climate variability and the response to changing forcings. In this paper we argue that we now have the modeling capability to address these requirements—specifically with global models having horizontal resolutions considerably enhanced from those typically used in previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) exercises. The improved representation of weather and climate processes in such models underpins our enhanced confidence in predictions and projections, as well as providing improved forcing to regional models, which are better able to represent local-scale extremes (such as convective precipitation). We choose the global water cycle as an illustrative example because it is governed by a chain of processes for which there is growing evidence of the benefits of higher resolution. At the same time it comprises key processes involved in many of the expected future climate extremes (e.g., flooding, drought, tropical and midlatitude storms).},

abstract = {This study provides an overview of the state of the art of modeling SST teleconnections to Africa and begins to investigate the sources of error. Data are obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) archives, phases 3 and 5 (CMIP3 and CMIP5), using the “20C3M” and “historical” coupled model experiments. A systematic approach is adopted, with the scope narrowed to six large-scale regions of sub-Saharan Africa within which seasonal rainfall anomalies are reasonably coherent, along with six SST modes known to affect these regions. No significant nonstationarity of the strength of these 6 × 6 teleconnections is found in observations. The capability of models to represent each teleconnection is then assessed (whereby half the teleconnections have observed SST–rainfall correlations that differ significantly from zero). A few of these teleconnections are found to be relatively easy to model, while a few more pose substantial challenges to models and many others exhibit a wide variety of model skill. Furthermore, some models perform consistently better than others, with the best able to at least adequately simulate 80{\%}–85{\%} of the 36 teleconnections. No improvement is found between CMIP3 and CMIP5. Analysis of atmosphere-only simulations suggests that the coupled model teleconnection errors may arise primarily from errors in their SST climatology and variability, although errors in the atmospheric component of teleconnections also play a role. Last, no straightforward relationship is found between the quality of a model's teleconnection to Africa and its SST or rainfall biases or its resolution. Perhaps not surprisingly, the causes of these errors are complex, and will require considerable further investigation.},

abstract = {Projections of climate change over Africa are highly uncertain, with wide disparity amongst models in their magnitude of local rainfall and temperature change, and in some regions even disparity in the sign of rainfall change. This has significant implications for decision-makers within the context of a vulnerable population and few resources for adaptation. One approach towards addressing this uncertainty is to rank models according to their historical climate performance and disregard those with least skill. This approach is systematically evaluated by defining 23 metrics of model skill and focussing on two vulnerable regions of Africa, the Sahel and the Greater Horn of Africa. Some discrimination in the performance of 39 CMIP5 models is achieved, although divergence amongst metrics in their ranking of climate models implies some uncertainty in using these metrics to robustly judge the models' relative performance. Importantly, when the more capable models are selected by an overall performance measure, projection uncertainty is not reduced because these models are typically spread across the full range of projections (except perhaps for Central to East Sahel rainfall). This suggests that the method's underlying assumption is false, this assumption being that the modelled processes that most strongly drive errors and uncertainty in projected change are a subset of the processes whose errors are observed by standard metrics of historical climate. Further research must now develop an expert judgement approach that will discriminate models using an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms that drive the errors and uncertainty in projected changes over Africa.},

abstract = {The “long rains” season of East Africa has recently experienced a series of devastating droughts, whereas the majority of climate models predict increasing rainfall for the coming decades. This has been termed the East African climate paradox and has implications for developing viable adaptation policies. A logical framework is adopted that leads to six key hypotheses that could explain this paradox. The first hypothesis that the recent observed trend is due to poor quality data is promptly rejected. An initial judgment on the second hypothesis that the projected trend is founded on poor modeling is beyond the scope of a single study. Analysis of a natural variability hypothesis suggests this is unlikely to have been the dominant driver of recent droughts, although it may have contributed. The next two hypotheses explore whether the balance between competing forcings could be changing. Regarding the possibility that the past trend could be due to changing anthropogenic aerosol emissions, the results of sensitivity experiments are highly model dependent, but some show a significant impact on the patterns of tropical SST trends, aspects of which likely caused the recent long rains droughts. Further experiments suggest land-use changes are unlikely to have caused the recent droughts. The last hypothesis that the response to CO2 emissions is nonlinear explains no more than 10{\%} of the contrast between recent and projected trends. In conclusion, it is recommended that research priorities now focus on providing a process-based expert judgment of the reliability of East Africa projections, improving the modeling of aerosol impacts on rainfall, and better understanding the relevant natural variability.},

Here we show that despite these negative trends, there is a threefold increase in widespread extreme rain events over central India during 1950-2015. The rise in these events is due to an increasing variability of the low-level monsoon westerlies over the Arabian Sea, driving surges of moisture supply, leading to extreme rainfall episodes across the entire central subcontinent. The homogeneity of these severe weather events and their association with the ocean temperatures underscores the potential predictability of these events by two-to-three weeks, which offers hope in mitigating their catastrophic impact on life, agriculture and property.},

The authors examined simulations from 15GCMsthat included both natural and anthropogenic forcing and simulations from 7 GCMs that included only natural forcing. The decline in observedNHSCE could be largely explained by the combined natural and anthropogenic forcing but not by natural forcing alone. However, the 15 GCMs, taken as a whole, underpredicted the combined forcing re- sponse by a factor of 2. How much of this underprediction was due to underrepresentation of the sensitivity to external forcing of theGCMs or to their underrepresentation of internal variability has yet to be determined.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and vulnerable climate change “hotspots” of the twenty-first century, and the physical mechanisms underlying this finding are still not clear. Furthermore, complex interactions and feedbacks involving ocean–atmosphere–land–biogeochemical processes play a prominent role in modulating the climate and environment of the Mediterranean region on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is critical to provide robust climate change information for use in vulnerability–impact–adaptation assessment studies considering the Mediterranean as a fully coupled environmental system. The Mediterranean Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Med-CORDEX) initiative aims at coordinating the Mediterranean climate modeling community toward the development of fully coupled regional climate simulations, improving all relevant components of the system from atmosphere and ocean dynamics to land surface, hydrology, and biogeochemical processes. The primary goals of Med-CORDEX are to improve understanding of past climate variability and trends and to provide more accurate and reliable future projections, assessing in a quantitative and robust way the added value of using high-resolution and coupled regional climate models. The coordination activities and the scientific outcomes of Med-CORDEX can produce an important framework to foster the development of regional Earth system models in several key regions worldwide.},

abstract = {We assess the ability of Global Climate Models participating in phases 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5) to simulate observed annual precipitation cycles over the Caribbean. Compared to weather station records and gridded observations, we find that both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models can be grouped into three categories: (1) models that correctly simulate a bimodal distribution with two rainfall maxima in May–June and September–October, punctuated by a mid-summer drought (MSD) in July–August; (2) models that reproduce the MSD and the second precipitation maxima only; and (3) models that simulate only one precipitation maxima, beginning in early summer. These categories appear related to model simulation of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, models in category 2 tend to anticipate the westward expansion of the NASH into the Caribbean in early summer. Early onset of NASH results in strong moisture divergence and MSD-like conditions at the time of the May–June observed precipitation maxima. Models in category 3 tend to have cooler SST across the region, particularly over the central Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as a weaker Caribbean low-level jet accompanying a weaker NASH. In these models, observed June-like patterns of moisture convergence in the central Caribbean and the Central America and divergence in the east Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico persist through September. This analysis suggests systematic biases in model structure may be responsible for biases in observed precipitation variability over the Caribbean and more confidence may be placed in the precipitation simulated by the GCMs that are able to correctly simulate seasonal cycles of SST and NASH.},

abstract = {This study examines the feasibility of using a variable resolution global general circulation model (GCM), with telescopic zooming and enhanced resolution ({\~{}}35 km) over South Asia, to better understand regional aspects of the South Asian monsoon rainfall distribution and the interactions between monsoon circulation and precipitation. For this purpose, two sets of ten member realizations are produced with and without zooming using the LMDZ (Laboratoire Meteorologie Dynamique and Z stands for zoom) GCM. The simulations without zoom correspond to a uniform 1° × 1° grid with the same total number of grid points as in the zoom version. So the grid of the zoomed simulations is finer inside the region of interest but coarser outside. The use of these finer and coarser resolution ensemble members allows us to examine the impact of resolution on the overall quality of the simulated regional monsoon fields. It is found that the monsoon simulation with high-resolution zooming greatly improves the representation of the southwesterly monsoon flow and the heavy precipitation along the narrow orography of the Western Ghats, the northeastern mountain slopes and northern Bay of Bengal (BOB). A realistic Monsoon Trough (MT) is also noticed in the zoomed simulation, together with remarkable improvements in representing the associated precipitation and circulation features, as well as the large-scale organization of meso-scale convective systems over the MT region. Additionally, a more reasonable simulation of the monsoon synoptic disturbances (lows and disturbances) along the MT is noted in the high-resolution zoomed simulation. On the other hand, the no-zoom version has limitations in capturing the depressions and their movement, so that the MT zone is relatively dry in this case. Overall, the results from this work demonstrate the usefulness of the high-resolution variable resolution LMDZ model in realistically capturing the interactions among the monsoon large-scale dynamics, the synoptic systems and the meso-scale convective systems, which are essential elements of the South Asian monsoon system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Impacts of climate change on Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) and the growing population pose a major threat to water and food security in India. Adapting to such changes needs reliable projections of ISMR by general circulation models. Here we find that, majority of new generation climate models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase5 (CMIP5) fail to simulate the post-1950 decreasing trend of ISMR. The weakening of monsoon is associated with the warming of Southern Indian Ocean and strengthening of cyclonic formation in the tropical western Pacific Ocean. We also find that these large-scale changes are not captured by CMIP5 models, with few exceptions, which is the reason of this failure. Proper representation of these highlighted geophysical processes in next generation models may improve the reliability of ISMR projections. Our results also alert the water resource planners to evaluate the CMIP5 models before using them for adaptation strategies.

abstract = {Quality controlled and recently homogenised mean sea level pressure records for the South Pacific are used to specify the location and variability of the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) during the austral warm season (November-April). The SPCZ is the world's largest rainfall band during the austral summer, when it dominates the climate of the South Pacific. A new index called the South Pacific convergence zone index (SPCZI) is derived, and is shown to be coherent with changes in low level wind convergence associated with the SPCZ. This index replaces the earlier SPCZ position index because it uses higher quality mean sea level pressure data than the superseded index and extends the time series further forward in time. The SPCZI allows interannual to decadal variability in the climate of the South Pacific to be tracked for more than a century from 1910/1911 to 2011/2012. During El Ni{\~{n}}o episodes the SPCZ is displaced by about 1°-3° east, and La Ni{\~{n}}a events 1°-3° west of the mean position on average. The index indicates a striking movement eastward for the period 1977/78-1998/99, compared with 1944/45-1976/77 in association with the Interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO). The eastward movement of the SPCZ in the late twentieth century is related to significant precipitation trends in the South Pacific region. Since 1998/99 the SPCZ has regressed westward with the negative phase change of the IPO. The long-term trend in the SPCZI is very small relative to the interannual to decadal variability and is not statistically significant, suggesting that there has been little overall change in the mean position of the SPCZ over the past century. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {New Zealand has a long, continuous record of annual measurements of the altitude of end-of-summer-snowline for a set of 50 Southern Alps “index glaciers.” The record begins for the 1976–1977 glacier year and continues to the present. These are equivalent to equilibrium line altitude (ELA) data. An earlier paper used these to estimate annual mass balance and ice volume for all glaciers up to 2008 and showed a steady decline in ice volume, but with considerable inter-annual fluctuations. These results are updated to 2018 for the more than 3,000 small and medium-size glaciers of the Southern Alps. The inclusion of the latter year enabled assessment of the impacts on ice volume of these glaciers from an unprecedented coupled ocean-atmosphere heatwave in the New Zealand region during the austral summer (DJF) 2017/18. The main purpose of this paper is to examine how these changes in ice volume relate to variability and trends in atmospheric circulation and weather types over four decades. Years with ice volume gains are characterized by below average temperature anomalies, enhanced southwest flow and a tendency for trough weather types over New Zealand. Years with ice volume losses have above average temperature, reduced southwest flow, and increased blocking weather types, with more anticyclones east of New Zealand. Largest annual ice volume loss of 3.6 ± 0.6 km3 (−13.5{\%}) occurred during the 2017/18 summer heatwave for which the main atmospheric anomalies are discussed. Total ice volume of the Southern Alps for the small and medium glaciers has decreased from 26.6 km3 in 1977 to 17.9 km3 in 2018 (a loss of 8.6 km3 or 33{\%}) at a rate of 0.21 km3 a−1. From 1977 to 1997 there was an annual ice gain of +0.30 km3 a−1 but was followed by an accelerating ice loss of −0.67 km3 a−1 for the period 1998–2018. There are significant correlations between ice volume changes and the Trenberth regional circulation indices Z1, Z3 and MZ3. Strongest relationships are with the Southern Annular Mode: a trend towards more positive values coincides with a general loss of ice volume. The Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation and El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation relate to ice volume changes on decadal to inter-annual time scales. Positive phases of the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation and El Ni{\~{n}}o years favour ice volume growth as they are cooler, with more precipitation, troughs and southwest flow over New Zealand.

The rain gauge data are obtained from a dense inter-institutional station network for December 1, 2008 to November 30, 2010 over South America. The evaluated satellite rainfall products are the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42 V6, V7 and RT, the NOAA/Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH), Hydroestimator (HYDRO) and the Combined Scheme algorithm (CoSch). The validation and intercomparison of these products are focused on southern South America. The performance improves in the "blended" estimates by including microwave observations and surface observations in the adjustments, i.e., 3B42 V6, V7 and CoSch; however, large overestimations are detectable in CMORPH, principally for extreme values over plains areas. The estimates based on parameters associated with infrared images only (HYDRO) underestimate precipitation south of 20° S and tend to overestimate the warm precipitation to the north. The inclusion of observed precipitation data is convenient from monthly (3B42 V7 and V6) to daily scales (CoSch) and improves the estimates. The estimates that include microwave observations show a strong tendency to overestimate extreme values of precipitation over 70. mm. This effect is strongly evident in northern and central Argentina and southern Brazil. A deeper assessment is necessary, particularly over the Central Andes, where effects of topography principally associated with solid precipitation correspond to the persistence of majorly overestimated precipitation.},

abstract = {The existence of long-term persistence (LTP) in hydro-climatic time series can lead to considerable change in significance of trends. Therefore, past findings of climatic trend studies that did not consider LTP became a disputable issue. A study has been conducted to assess the trends in temperature and temperature extremes in Iraq in recent years (1965–2015) using both ordinary Mann-Kendal (MK) test; and the modified Mann-Kendall (m-MK) test, which can differentiate the multi-decadal oscillatory variations from secular trends. Trends in annual and seasonal minimum and maximum temperatures, diurnal temperature range (DTR), and 14 temperature-related extremes were assessed. MK test detected the significant increases in minimum and maximum temperature at all stations, where m-MK test detected at 86{\%} and 80{\%} of all stations, respectively. The temperature in Iraq is increasing 2 to 7 times faster than global temperature rise. The minimum temperature is increasing more (0.48–1.17°C/decade) than maximum temperature (0.25–1.01°C/decade). Temperature rise is higher in northern Iraq and in summer. The hot extremes particularly warm nights are increasing all over Iraq at a rate of 2.92–10.69days/decade, respectively. On the other hand, numbers of cold days are decreasing at some stations at a rate of −2.65 to −8.40days/decade. The use of m-MK test along with MK test confirms the significant increase in temperature and some of the temperature extremes in Iraq. This study suggests that trends in many temperature extremes in the region estimated in previous studies using MK test may be due to natural variability of climate, which empathizes the need for validation of the trends by considering LTP in time series.},

abstract = {Regional climate models (RCMs) constitute a powerful tool to study and understand climate variability and change at local scales. Nevertheless, to correctly interpret regional climate simulations, a number of uncertainties need to be considered. In this study, we investigate the so-called Internal Variability (IV) of an RCM. The IV can be defined as the degree of irreproducibility in an RCM solution observed when it is conducted by the same lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) but initialised from different initial states. The main goal of this work is to investigate how the IV affects the cyclone tracks simulated by an RCM over a Mediterranean domain. For standard variables such as sea level pressure, 2 m temperature and precipitation, our results over the Mediterranean region are consistent with studies conducted over other geographical domains: the IV is stronger at the easternmost part of the domain, where the control exerted by the LBCs is weaker; the IV shows a strong seasonal dependence, reaching larger values in summer than in winter. We show here that the IV values associated with the density of cyclone tracks are much stronger than for the other documented variables, reaching more than 50 {\%} of the estimated total variability. Concerning the cyclone characteristics, long travelling tracks are associated to a greatest IV. Within the latter cyclone category, the fast moving cyclones seems to exhibit also larger IV values. A secondary IV maximum is observed for static cyclones with short travelling distances (thermal lows) during the warm season.},

abstract = {This paper presents trends in downward surface shortwave radiation (SSR) over Europe, which are based on the 56 longest series available from the Global Energy Balance Archive that are mainly concentrated in central Europe. Special emphasis has been placed on both ensuring the temporal homogeneity and including the most recent years in the data set. We have generated, for the first time, composite time series for Europe covering the period 1939–2012, which have been studied by means of running trend analysis. The mean annual SSR series shows an increase from the late 1930s to the early 1950s (i.e., early brightening), followed by a reduction until mid-1980s (i.e., global dimming) and a subsequent increase up to the early 2000s (i.e., global brightening). The series ends with a tendency of stabilization since the early 21st century, but the short time period is insufficient with regard to establishing whether a change in the trend is actually emerging over Europe. Seasonal and regional series are also presented, which highlight that similar variations are obtained for most of the seasons and regions across Europe. In fact, due to the strong spatial correlation in the SSR series, few series are enough to capture almost the same interannual and decadal variability as using a dense network of stations. Decadal variations of the SSR are expected to have an impact on the modulation of the temperatures and other processes over Europe linked with changes in the hydrological cycle, agriculture production, or natural ecosystems. For a better dissemination of the time series developed in this study, the data set is freely available for scientific purposes.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we discuss the results of downscaling the climate over the Indian sub-continent using regional climate models (RCMs) following the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment (CORDEX) framework. The climate change projections of four atmosphere-ocean coupled-global climate models (AOGCMs) have been downscaled for the period 1950–2100. The results of the downscaled RCMs are compared to those of the driving AOGCMs for the present climate in the period 1976–2005, to investigate whether RCMs are able to show added value, at regional scale relative to the performances of their driving AOGCMs. It is found that the spatial patterns of surface air temperature and seasonal precipitation are strongly affected by the choice of the RCM and driving AOGCMs. The RCMs are, however, able to improve the representation of the annual cycle of temperature in particular over the central India. The CORDEX South Asia RCMs indicate significant increases in temperatures over India in the mid-term (2031–2060) future climate change projections with the RCP4.5 scenario. However, the magnitude and sign of the summer monsoon season precipitation change over India is uncertain.},

abstract = {Using daily (monthly) rainfall data from 167 (254) stations across West Africa with at least 80{\%} data availability for the 31-year period 1980-2010 and the gridded African Rainfall Climatology Version 2 (ARC2) for the period 1983-2010, linear trends in yearly and monthly rainfall totals were investigated. Measures of the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and two rainy season onset and retreat definitions were employed to assess the corresponding trends in frequency and intensity of daily rainfall and changes to monsoon season length. A rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis yielded two homogeneous rainfall regions, the Sahel and Guinea Coast, in terms of interannual to decadal rainfall variability, and this led to analysis of station data and Standardised Precipitation Index for the two regions. Results show that the majority of stations in the Sahel between the West Coast and 15°E shows a statistically significant positive rainfall trend for annual totals. The August-October period exhibits the largest rainfall recovery in the Sahel and the date of the retreat of the rainy season significantly moved later into the year by 2 days decade-1. The recovery is reflected both in more rainy days associated with longer wet spell duration and more extreme rainfall events. Trends along the Guinea Coast are weak and non-significant except for extreme rainfall related indices. This missing significance is partly related to the hiatus in rainfall increase in the 1990s, but also to the larger interannual rainfall variability. However, the tendency towards a more intense second rainy season suggests a later withdrawal of rains from the West African subcontinent. ARC2 trends are broadly consistent where ground calibration was undertaken, but are dubious for Nigeria and Ghana, and especially for the Guinea, Jos and Cameroon Line highlands due to missing gauge data.},

abstract = {Prediction of high latitude response to climate change is hampered by poor understanding of the role of nonlinear changes in ecosystem forcing and response. While the effects of nonlinear climate change are often delayed or dampened by internal ecosystem dynamics, recent warming events in the Arctic have driven rapid environmental response, raising questions of how terrestrial and freshwater systems in this region may shift in response to abrupt climate change. We quantified environmental responses to recent abrupt climate change in West Greenland using long-term monitoring and paleoecological reconstructions. Using {\&}gt;40 years of weather data, we found that after 1994, mean June air temperatures shifted 2.2{\textordmasculine}C higher and mean winter precipitation doubled from 21 to 40 mm; since 2006, mean July air temperatures shifted 1.1{\textordmasculine}C higher. Nonlinear environmental responses occurred with or shortly after these abrupt climate shifts, including increasing ice sheet discharge, increasing dust, advancing plant phenology, and in lakes, earlier ice out and greater diversity of algal functional traits. Our analyses reveal rapid environmental responses to nonlinear climate shifts, underscoring the highly responsive nature of Arctic ecosystems to abrupt transitions.},

abstract = {Abstract. This paper proposes a protocol to assess the space–time consistency of 12 satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) according to various indicators, including (i) direct comparison of SPPs with 72 precipitation gauges; (ii) sensitivity of streamflow modelling to SPPs at the outlet of four basins; and (iii) the sensitivity of distributed snow models to SPPs using a MODIS snow product as reference in an unmonitored mountainous area. The protocol was applied successively to four different time windows (2000–2004, 2004–2008, 2008–2012 and 2000–2012) to account for the space–time variability of the SPPs and to a large dataset composed of 12 SPPs (CMORPH–RAW v.1, CMORPH–CRT v.1, CMORPH–BLD v.1, CHIRP v.2, CHIRPS v.2, GSMaP v.6, MSWEP v.2.1, PERSIANN, PERSIANN–CDR, TMPA–RT v.7, TMPA–Adj v.7 and SM2Rain–CCI v.2), an unprecedented comparison. The aim of using different space scales and timescales and indicators was to evaluate whether the efficiency of SPPs varies with the method of assessment, time window and location. Results revealed very high discrepancies between SPPs. Compared to precipitation gauge observations, some SPPs (CMORPH–RAW v.1, CMORPH–CRT v.1, GSMaP v.6, PERSIANN, and TMPA–RT v.7) are unable to estimate regional precipitation, whereas the others (CHIRP v.2, CHIRPS v.2, CMORPH–BLD v.1, MSWEP v.2.1, PERSIANN–CDR, and TMPA–Adj v.7) produce a realistic representation despite recurrent spatial limitation over regions with contrasted emissivity, temperature and orography. In 9 out of 10 of the cases studied, streamflow was more realistically simulated when SPPs were used as forcing precipitation data rather than precipitation derived from the available precipitation gauge networks, whereas the SPP's ability to reproduce the duration of MODIS-based snow cover resulted in poorer simulations than simulation using available precipitation gauges. Interestingly, the potential of the SPPs varied significantly when they were used to reproduce gauge precipitation estimates, streamflow observations or snow cover duration and depending on the time window considered. SPPs thus produce space–time errors that cannot be assessed when a single indicator and/or time window is used, underlining the importance of carefully considering their space–time consistency before using them for hydro-climatic studies. Among all the SPPs assessed, MSWEP v.2.1 showed the highest space–time accuracy and consistency in reproducing gauge precipitation estimates, streamflow and snow cover duration.},

We jointly investigate climate projections, vulnerability, impacts, and options for adaptation. Precipitation in North Africa is likely to decrease between 10 and 20{\%}, while temperatures are likely to rise between 2 and 3. °C by 2050. This trend is most pronounced in the north-western parts of northern Africa as our own model results suggest. The combination of decreasing supply and strong population growth aggravates the stressed water situation in the region. We further compare the vulnerabilities, adaptive capacities and conflict implications of climate change in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. Climate change will likely have the strongest effect on Morocco where the agricultural sector is of high importance for the country's economy and particularly for poor people. Our analysis of climate impacts and adaptation options in Morocco suggests that the agricultural incentives used in the past are inadequate to buffer drought effects. To increase resilience against climate change, agricultural policies should shift from maximizing agricultural output to stabilizing it. Our bio-economic model results further suggest a considerable potential of replacing firewood by electric energy to sustain pastoral productivity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Twenty-first century snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) changes are assessed for three time periods (2020-2049, 2045-2079 and 2070-2099) at 11 stations in Switzerland with the physics-based snow model SNOWPACK and meteorological input data perturbed by the output from ten regional climate models (RCMs) through the delta change method. Unlike in previous studies, incoming long-wave radiation has also been modified for future climatic conditions. We thus show the range of future snow simulations assuming different RCM projections. Model validation yields satisfying results for simulating snow depth and SWE for the reference period with errors in the order of 9{\%} and 15{\%}, respectively. For the end of the century, the stations between 1000-1700m a.s.l. show no pronounced elevation dependence but surprisingly react quite similarly in terms of the relative magnitude of snow cover decrease, which may reach 90{\%}. The projected small increase in winter precipitation has almost no effect at these stations, but incoming long-wave radiation has an important effect. At the high-elevation station Weissfluhjoch (2540m a.s.l.) however, the precipitation increase is partly able to compensate for the increased temperature. This would imply that the snow cover at mid-elevation stations becomes temperature and radiation dominated and will react similarly to the spatially small differences in the projected temperature change. The low-elevation stations already show a strong decrease in the near future, and the inclusion of modified incoming long-wave radiation has almost no effect on the decrease of future snow depth and SWE because the temperatures are already close to the melting point in the reference period. At the end of the century, mean snow depth/SWE are reduced by 35/32{\%}, 83/86{\%} and 96/97{\%} at high-, mid- and low-elevations, respectively.},

abstract = {Many countries rely on regional climate model (RCM) projections to quantify the impacts of climate change and to design their adaptation plans accordingly. In several European regions, RCMs project a smaller temperature increase than global climate models (GCMs), which is hypothesised to be due to discrepant representations of topography, cloud processes, or aerosol forcing in RCMs and GCMs. Additionally, RCMs do generally not consider the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations; a process which is, however, included in most GCMs. Plants adapt to higher CO2 concentrations by closing their stomata, which can lead to reduced transpiration with concomitant surface warming, in particular, during temperature extremes. Here we show that embedding plant physiological responses to elevated CO2 concentrations in an RCM leads to significantly higher projected extreme temperatures in Europe. Annual maximum temperatures rise additionally by about 0.6 K (0.1 K in southern, 1.2 K in northern Europe) by 2070–2099, explaining about 67{\%} of the stronger annual maximum temperature increase in GCMs compared to RCMs. Missing plant physiological CO2 responses thus strongly contribute to the underestimation of temperature trends in RCMs. The need for robust climate change assessments calls for a comprehensive implementation of this process in RCM land surface schemes.},

abstract = {Understanding the drivers of surface melting in West Antarctica is crucial for understanding future ice loss and global sea level rise. This study identifies atmospheric drivers of surface melt on West Antarctic ice shelves and ice sheet margins and relationships with tropical Pacific and high-latitude climate forcing using multidecadal reanalysis and satellite datasets. Physical drivers of ice melt are diagnosed by comparing satellite-observed melt patterns to anomalies of reanalysis near-surface air temperature, winds, and satellite-derived cloud cover, radiative fluxes, and sea ice concentration based on an Antarctic summer synoptic climatology spanning 1979–2017. Summer warming in West Antarctica is favored by Amundsen Sea (AS) blocking activity and a negative phase of the southern annular mode (SAM), which both correlate with El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Extensive melt events on the Ross–Amundsen sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) are linked to persistent, intense AS blocking anticyclones, which force intrusions of marine air over the ice sheet. Surface melting is primarily driven by enhanced downwelling longwave radiation from clouds and a warm, moist atmosphere and by turbulent mixing of sensible heat to the surface by f{\"{o}}hn winds. Since the late 1990s, concurrent with ocean-driven WAIS mass loss, summer surface melt occurrence has increased from the Amundsen Sea Embayment to the eastern Ross Ice Shelf. We link this change to increasing anticyclonic advection of marine air into West Antarctica, amplified by increasing air–sea fluxes associated with declining sea ice concentration in the coastal Ross–Amundsen Seas.},

Here we explore the potential effects of climatic change on the flow regime of the Thau and the Chiba catchments which are located in Southern France and Northeastern Tunisia, respectively. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model is forced with projections from an ensemble of 4 climate model (CM) to assess changes and uncertainty in relevant hydrological indicators related to water balance, magnitude, frequency and timing of the flow between a reference (1971-2000) and future (2041-2071) periods. Results indicate that both catchments are likely to experience a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature in the future. Consequently, runoff and soil water content are projected to decrease whereas potential evapotranspiration is likely to increase in both catchments. Yet uncertain, the projected magnitudes of these changes are higher in the wet period than in the dry period. Analyses of extreme flow show similar trend in both catchments, projecting a decrease in both high flow and low flow magnitudes for various time durations. Further, significant increase in low flow frequency as a proxy for hydrological droughts is projected for both catchments but with higher uncertainty in the wet period than in the dry period. Although no changes in the average timing of maximum and minimum flow events for different flow durations are projected, substantial uncertainty remains in the hydrological projections. While the results in both catchments show consistent trend of change for most of the hydrologic indicators, the overall degree of alteration on the flow regime of the Chiba catchment is projected to be higher than that of the Thau catchment. The projected magnitudes of alteration as well as their associated uncertainty vary depending on the catchment characteristics and flow seasonality.},

abstract = {Abstract We document the development of the first version of the United Kingdom Earth System Model UKESM1. The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2-ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include: a new core physical model with a well-resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric-stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane and nitrous oxide; two-moment, five-species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two-way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities, and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall the model performs well, with a stable pre-industrial state, and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger-than-observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealised simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is 5.4 K, transient climate response (TCR) ranges from 2.68 K to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) is 2.49 K/TtC to 2.66 K/TtC.},

abstract = {Numerical experiments with the ECHAM5 atmospheric general circulation model have been performed in order to simulate the influence of changes in the ocean surface temperature (OST) and sea ice concentration (SIC) on climate characteristics in regions of Eurasia. The sensitivity of winter and summer climates to OST and SIC variations in 1998–2006 has been investigated and compared to those in 1968–1976. These two intervals correspond to the maximum and minimum of the Atlantic Long-Period Oscillation (ALO) index. Apart from the experiments on changes in the OST and SIC global fields, the experiments on OST anomalies only in the North Atlantic and SIC anomalies in the Arctic for the specified periods have been analyzed. It is established that temperature variations in Western Europe are explained by OST and SIC variations fairly well, whereas the warmings in Eastern Europe and Western Siberia, according to model experiments, are substantially (by a factor of 2–3) smaller than according to observational data. Winter changes in the temperature regime in continental regions are controlled mainly by atmospheric circulation anomalies. The model, on the whole, reproduces the empirical structure of changes in the winter field of surface pressure, in particular, the pressure decrease in the Caspian region; however, it substantially (approximately by three times) underestimates the range of changes. Summer temperature variations in the model are characterized by a higher statistical significance than winter ones. The analysis of the sensitivity of the climate in Western Europe to SIC variations alone in the Arctic is an important result of the experiments performed. It is established that the SIC decrease and a strong warming over the Barents Sea in the winter period leads to a cooling over vast regions of the northern part of Eurasia and increases the probability of anomalously cold January months by two times and more (for regions in Western Siberia). This effect is caused by the formation of the increased-pressure region with a center over the southern boundary of the Barents Sea during the SIC decrease and an anomalous advection of cold air masses from the northeast. This result indicates that, to estimate the ALO actions (as well as other long-scale climatic variability modes) on the climate of Eurasia, it is basically important to take into account (or correctly reproduce) Arctic sea ice changes in experiments with climatic models.},

abstract = {We analyze projected changes in climate extremes (extreme temperatures and heavy precipitation) in the multimodel ensembles of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP5 and CMIP6). The results reveal close similarity between both ensembles in the regional climate sensitivity of the projected multimodel mean changes in climate extremes, that is, their projected changes as a function of global warming. This stands in contrast to widely reported divergences in global (transient and equilibrium) climate sensitivity in the two multimodel ensembles. Some exceptions include higher warming in the South America monsoon region, lower warming in Southern Asia and Central Africa, and higher increases in heavy precipitation in Western Africa and the Sahel region in the CMIP6 ensemble. The multimodel spread in regional climate sensitivity is found to be large in both ensembles. In particular, it contributes more to intermodel spread in projected regional climate extremes compared with the intermodel spread in global climate sensitivity in CMIP6. Our results highlight the need to consider regional climate sensitivity as a distinct feature of Earth system models and a key determinant of projected regional impacts, which is largely independent of the models' response in global climate sensitivity.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial advances in understanding Arctic amplification - that trends and variability in surface air temperature tend to be larger in the Arctic region than for the Northern Hemisphere or globe as a whole. We provide a synthesis of research on Arctic amplification, starting with a historical context and then addressing recent insights into processes and key impacts, based on analysis of the instrumental record, modeling studies, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Arctic amplification is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation flux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic amplification are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic amplification being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {This study explores the impacts of the desiccation of the Aral Sea and large-scale climate change on the regional climate of Central Asia in the post-1960 era. A series of climate downscaling experiments for the 1960's and 2000's decades were performed using the Weather Research and Forecast model at 12-km horizontal resolution. To quantify the impacts of the changing surface boundary condition, a set of simulations with an identical lateral boundary condition but different extents of the Aral Sea were performed. It was found that the desiccation of the Aral Sea leads to more snow (and less rain) as desiccated winter surface is relatively much colder than water surface. In summer, desiccation led to substantial warming over the Aral Sea. These impacts were largely confined to within the area covered by the former Aral Sea and its immediate vicinity, although desiccation of the Sea also led to minor cooling over the greater Central Asia in winter. A contrasting set of simulations with an identical surface boundary condition but different lateral boundary conditions produced more identifiable changes in regional climate over the greater Central Asia which was characterized by a warming trend in both winter and summer. Simulations also showed that while the desiccation of the Aral Sea has significant impacts on the local climate over the Sea, the climate over the greater Central Asia on inter-decadal time scale was more strongly influenced by the continental or global-scale climate change on that time scale.},

The authors first examined the characteristics of the existing EAWM indices to find a suitable index for the APCC seasonal forecast system. This examination revealed that the selected index shows reasonable prediction skill of EAWM intensity and well-represents the characteristics of wintertime temperature anomalies associated with the EAWM, especially for the extreme cold winters. Although most models capture the main characteristics of the seasonal mean circulation over East Asia reasonably well, they still suffer from difficulty in predicting the interannual variability (IAV) of the EAWM. Fortunately, the POAMA has reasonable skill in capturing the timing and strength of the EAWM IAV and reproduces the EAWM-related circulation anomalies well. The better performance of the POAMA may be attributed to the better skill in simulating the high-latitude forcing including the Siberian High (SH) and Artic Oscillation (AO) and the strong links of the ENSO to the EAWM, compared to other models.},

abstract = {Northern South America is identified as one of the most vulnerable regions to be affected by climate change. Furthermore, recent extreme wet seasons over the region have induced socioeconomic impacts of wide proportions. Hence, the evaluation of rainfall simulations at seasonal and interannual time scales by the CMIP5 models is urgently required. Here, we evaluated the ability of seven CMIP5 models (selected based on literature review) to represent the seasonal mean precipitation and its interannual variability over northern South America. Our results suggest that it is easier for models to reproduce rainfall distribution during boreal summer and fall over both oceans and land. This is probably due to the fact that during these seasons, incoming radiation and ocean-atmosphere feedbacks over Atlantic and Pacific oceans locate the ITCZ on the Northern Hemisphere, as suggested by previous studies. Models exhibit the worse simulations during boreal winter and spring, when these processes have opposite effects locating the ITCZ. Our results suggest that the models with a better representation of the oceanic ITCZ and the local low-level jets over northern South America, such as the Choco low-level jet, are able to realistically simulate the main features of seasonal precipitation pattern over northern South America.},

abstract = {The rarity of reports in the literature of brief and spatially limited observations of drizzle at temperatures below −20 °C suggest that riming and other temperature‐dependent cloud microphysical processes such as heterogeneous ice nucleation and ice crystal depositional growth prevent drizzle persistence in cold environments. In this study, we report on a persistent drizzle event observed by ground‐based remote sensing measurements at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The temperatures in the drizzle‐producing cloud were below −25 °C and the drizzle persisted for a period exceeding 7.5 hr. Using ground‐based, satellite, and reanalysis data, we conclude that drizzle was likely present in parts of a widespread cloud field, which stretched more than {\~{}}1,000 km along the Ross Ice Shelf coast. Parameter space sensitivity tests using two‐moment bulk microphysics in large eddy simulations constrained by the observations suggest that activated ice freezing nuclei and accumulation‐mode aerosol number concentrations aloft during this persistent drizzle period were likely on the order of 0.2 L−1 and 20 cm−3, respectively. In such constrained simulations, the drizzle moisture flux through cloud base exceeds that of ice. The simulations also indicate that drizzle can lead to the formation of multiple peaks in cloud water content profiles. This study suggests that persistent drizzle at these low temperatures may be common at the low aerosol concentrations typical of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean atmospheres.},

abstract = {Intense thunderstorms produce rapid cloud updrafts and may be associated with a range of destructive weather events. An important ingredient in measures of the potential for intense thunderstorms is the convective available potential energy (CAPE). Climate models project increases in summertime mean CAPE in the tropics and subtropics in response to global warming, but the physical mechanisms responsible for such increases and the implications for future thunderstorm activity remain uncertain. Here, we show that high percentiles of the CAPE distribution (CAPE extremes) also increase robustly with warming across the tropics and subtropics in an ensemble of state-of-the-art climate models, implying strong increases in the frequency of occurrence of environments conducive to intense thunderstorms in future climate projections. The increase in CAPE extremes is consistent with a recently proposed theoretical model in which CAPE depends on the influence of convective entrainment on the tropospheric lapse rate, and we demonstrate the importance of this influence for simulated CAPE extremes using a climate model in which the convective entrainment rate is varied. We further show that the theoretical model is able to account for the climatological relationship between CAPE and a measure of lower-tropospheric humidity in simulations and in observations. Our results provide a physical basis on which to understand projected future increases in intense thunderstorm potential, and they suggest that an important mechanism that contributes to such increases may be present in Earth's atmosphere.},

abstract = {Dynamic Regional Climate Models (RCMs) work at fine resolution for a limited region and hence they are presumed to simulate regional climate better than General Circulation Models (GCMs). Simulations by RCMs are used for impacts assessment, often without any evaluation. There is a growing debate on the added value made by the regional models to the projections of GCMs specifically for the regions like, United States and Europe. Evaluation of RCMs for Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) has been overlooked in literature, though there are few disjoint studies on Indian monsoon extremes and biases. Here we present a comprehensive study on the evaluations of RCMs for the ISMR with all its important characteristics such as northward and eastward propagation, onset, seasonal rainfall patterns, intra-seasonal oscillations, spatial variability and patterns of extremes. We evaluate nine regional simulations from Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment and compare them with their host Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-5 GCM projections. We do not find any consistent improvement in the RCM simulations with respect to their host GCMs for any of the characteristics of Indian monsoon except the spatial variation. We also find that the simulations of the ISMR characteristics by a good number of RCMs, are worse than those of their host GCMs. No consistent added value is observed in the RCM simulations of changes in ISMR characteristics over recent periods, compared to past; though there are few exceptions. These results highlight the need for proper evaluation before utilizing regional models for impacts assessment and subsequent policy making for sustainable climate change adaptation.},

abstract = {Trends in time series of snow water equivalent (SWE) are analyzed for different time periods and as a function of elevation. Since 1914, hydropower companies have measured snow at the expected snow maximum. Most of the measurements are located at high elevations, 700-1, 700 meters above sea level (masl), providing a unique dataset in areas poorly covered by meteorological stations. For single stations, significant positive and negative trends are found using the Mann-Kendall trend test. The trends depend on region, observation period and elevation. In southern Norway negative trends are found for sites below 1, 350 masl for the periods 1931-1960 and 1991-2009, and below 850 masl for the period 1961-1990. Above these elevations, positive trends are found. For the entire period, 1931-2009, positive trends are found for stations located above 850 masl. These findings can be explained by varying trends in precipitation and temperature in winter and spring. For central and northern Norway, the pattern in trends is similar, although less pronounced. High and low values of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index correlate differently with SWE. High NAO index is positively correlated with SWE at high elevations and negatively at low elevations. Low NAO index is positively correlated with SWE at all elevations. {\textcopyright} 2012 IWA Publishing.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the results of a climate data rescue (DARE) activity conducted at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute (Kyiv, Ukraine) in cooperation with the Justus Liebig University Giessen (Giessen, Germany), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and Met Office Hadley Centre (Exeter, United Kingdom). The focus of our work is on pre-1850 sub-daily meteorological observations conducted on the territory of modern Ukraine. Data from eight stations (stored in special hard copy tables/books, with handwritten records) have been digitized during the DARE process, resulting in 291,103 rescued values in total. More than half of this number (165,980, {\~{}}57{\%}) are related to air temperature data, 124,376 data values ({\~{}}42.7{\%}) concern atmospheric pressure records and 747 values ({\~{}}0.3{\%}) are precipitation data. Simple quality control of the digitized data has been conducted, including an intercomparison between stations as well as comparison with monthly temperature data previously digitized from other paper sources. The quality control procedures revealed fairly good agreement between rescued time series on the monthly time scale as well as with the monthly data from independent sources. However, several periods for a few stations should be used with caution due to relatively large discrepancies that were found. The rescued digital database can be used for extreme value analysis for the pre-1850 period in comparison with today's climate, regional climatological studies and will be used for future Reanalysis. In addition, for the first time, we show that subdaily temperature from Kyiv during 'the year without summer' 1816 in Western and Central Europe were not anomalous in this part of Eastern Europe.},

abstract = {During the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), automated measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) were made at the Sodankyl{\"{a}} (Finland), Weissfluhjoch (Switzerland) and Caribou Creek (Canada) SPICE sites during the northern hemispheric winters of 2013/14 and 2014/15. Supplementary intercomparison measurements were made at Fortress Mountain (Kananaskis, Canada) during the 2013/14 winter. The objectives of this analysis are to compare automated SWE measurements with a reference, comment on their performance and, where possible, to make recommendations on how to best use the instruments and interpret their measurements. Sodankyl{\"{a}}, Caribou Creek and Fortress Mountain hosted a Campbell Scientific CS725 passive gamma radiation SWE sensor. Sodankyl{\"{a}} and Weissfluhjoch hosted a Sommer Messtechnik SSG1000 snow scale. The CS725 operating principle is based on measuring the attenuation of soil emitted gamma radiation by the snowpack and relating the attenuation to SWE. The SSG1000 measures the mass of the overlying snowpack directly by using a weighing platform and load cell. Manual SWE measurements were obtained at the intercomparison sites on a bi-weekly basis over the accumulation-Ablation periods using bulk density samplers. These manual measurements are considered to be the reference for the intercomparison. Results from Sodankyl{\"{a}} and Caribou Creek showed that the CS725 generally overestimates SWE as compared to manual measurements by roughly 30-35ĝ€-{\%} with correlations ({\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}/i{\textgreater}2) as high as 0.99 for Sodankyl{\"{a}} and 0.90 for Caribou Creek. The RMSE varied from 30 to 43ĝ€-mm water equivalent (mmĝ€-w.e.) and from 18 to 25ĝ€-mmĝ€-w.e. at Sodankyl{\"{a}} and Caribou Creek, which had respective SWE maximums of approximately 200 and 120ĝ€-mmĝ€-w.e. The correlation at Fortress Mountain was 0.94 (RMSE of 48ĝ€-mmĝ€-w.e. with a maximum SWE of approximately 650ĝ€-mmĝ€-w.e.) with no systematic overestimation. The SSG1000 snow scale, having a different measurement principle, agreed quite closely with the manual measurements at Sodankyl{\"{a}} and Weissfluhjoch throughout the periods when data were available ({\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}/i{\textgreater}2 as high as 0.99 and RMSE from 8 to 24ĝ€-mmĝ€-w.e. at Sodankyl{\"{a}} and from 56 to 59ĝ€-mmĝ€-w.e. at Weissfluhjoch, where maximum SWE was approximately 850ĝ€-mmĝ€-w.e.). When the SSG1000 was compared to the CS725 at Sodankyl{\"{a}}, the agreement was linear until the start of ablation when the positive bias in the CS725 increases substantially relative to the SSG1000. Since both Caribou Creek and Sodankyl{\"{a}} have sandy soil, water from the snowpack readily infiltrates into the soil during melt, even if the soil is frozen. However, the CS725 does not differentiate this water from the unmelted snow. This issue can be identified, at least during the late spring ablation period, with soil moisture and temperature observations like those measured at Caribou Creek. With a less permeable soil and surface runoff, the increase in the instrument bias during ablation is not as significant, as shown by the Fortress Mountain intercomparison.},

abstract = {Regional climate models (RCMs) are used with increasing resolutions seeking to represent in an improved way regional to local‐scale atmospheric phenomena. The EURO‐CORDEX simulations at 0.11° and simulations exploiting finer grid spacing approaching the convective‐permitting regimes are representative examples. These climate runs are computationally very demanding and do not always show improvements, which depend on the region, variable and object of study. The gains or losses associated with the use of higher resolution in relation to the forcing model (global climate model or reanalysis), or to different resolution RCM simulations, are widely known as added value. Its characterization is a long‐standing issue, and many different added‐value measures have been proposed. In the current study, a new method is proposed to assess the added value of finer‐resolution simulations, in comparison to its forcing data or coarser‐resolution counterparts. This approach builds on a probability density function (PDF) matching score, giving a normalized measure of the difference between diverse resolution PDFs, mediated by the observational ones. The distribution added value (DAV) is an objective added‐value measure that can be applied to any variable, region or temporal scale, from hindcast or historical (non‐synchronous) simulations. The DAVs metric and its application to the EURO‐CORDEX hindcast daily precipitation data are presented here. Generally, the EURO‐CORDEX simulations at both resolutions (0.44° and 0.11°) display a clear added value in relation to ERA‐Interim, with maximum values around 30{\%} in summer and 20{\%} in the intermediate seasons. When both RCM resolutions are directly compared, only three of five models (0.11°) show added value, with a maximum of ∼10{\%}. The regions with the larger DAVs are areas where convection is relevant, e.g. Alps and Iberia. When looking at the extreme PDF tail, the higher‐resolution improvement is generally greater than the low resolution for seasons and regions.},

abstract = {Abstract. Several studies have been devoted to dynamic and statistical downscaling for analysis of both climate variability and climate change. This paper introduces an application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multiple linear regression (MLR) by principal components to estimate rainfall in South America. This method is proposed for downscaling monthly precipitation time series over South America for three regions: the Amazon; northeastern Brazil; and the La Plata Basin, which is one of the regions of the planet that will be most affected by the climate change projected for the end of the 21st century. The downscaling models were developed and validated using CMIP5 model output and observed monthly precipitation. We used general circulation model (GCM) experiments for the 20th century (RCP historical; 1970–1999) and two scenarios (RCP 2.6 and 8.5; 2070–2100). The model test results indicate that the ANNs significantly outperform the MLR downscaling of monthly precipitation variability.},

abstract = {The capability of a set of 7 coordinated regional climate model simulations performed in the framework of the CLARIS-LPB Project in reproducing the mean climate conditions over the South American conti- nent has been evaluated. The model simulations were forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset for the period 1990–2008 on a grid resolution of 50 km, follow- ing the CORDEX protocol. The analysis was focused on evaluating the reliability of simulating mean precipitation and surface air temperature, which are the variables most commonly used for impact studies. Both the common features and the differences among individual models have been evaluated and compared against several observational datasets. In this study the ensemble bias and the degree of agreement among individual models have been quantified. The evaluation was focused on the sea- sonal means, the area-averaged annual cycles and the frequency distributions of monthly means over target sub- regions. Results show that the Regional Climate Model ensemble reproduces adequately well these features, with biases mostly within ±2 ?C and ±20 {\%} for temperature and precipitation, respectively. However, the multi-model ensemble depicts larger biases and larger uncertainty (as defined by the standard deviation of the models) over tropical regions compared with subtropical regions. Though some systematic biases were detected particularly over the La Plata Basin region, such as underestimation of rainfall during winter months and overestimation of tem- perature during summer months, every model shares a similar behavior and, consequently, the uncertainty in simulating current climate conditions is low. Every model is able to capture the variety in the shape of the frequency distribution for both temperature and precipitation along the South American continent. Differences among indi- vidual models and observations revealed the nature of individual model biases, showing either a shift in the distribution or an overestimation or underestimation of the range of variability.

Using observational data and gridded datasets, we studied the regional and seasonal differences of precipitation climate characteristics and variations in precipitation over Central Asia. Using observational data obtained from the China Meteorological Administration, Global Historical Climatology Network (V3.02), we divided Central Asia into four subregions (North, Center, Southwest, and Southeast) based on the differences in seasonal cycles of precipitation. ‘Single peaks' were detected as types of seasonal cycles over the North and the Southeast, while ‘two peaks' was the type that occurred in the Southwest. For the Center, the zone of transition between the North and the Southwest, each monthly precipitation value was higher than the Southwest's and less than the North's. GPCC (R2 of 0.89, RMSE of 64.5 mm/year) was proven to be the most suitable dataset of the four datasets (CRU, GPCC, MERRA, and TRMM) to describe precipitation in Central Asia, based on validation against observational data, and used to detect the spatial and temporal trend of precipitation in Central Asia and four subregions during 1960–2013. No significant trends were observed for annual precipitation in Central Asia, while precipitation in winter displayed a significant increase (0.11 mm/year). Additionally, significantly increasing trends (0.16, 0.27, 0.13, and 0.13 mm/year) were detected in spring, summer, autumn, and winter over the Southeast during 1960–2013.},

In this study, the COSMO-CLM2 Regional Climate Model is applied over the AIS and adapted for the specific meteorological and climatological conditions of the region. A 30-year hindcast was performed and evaluated against observational records consisting of long-term ground-based meteorological observations, automatic weather stations, radiosoundings, satellite records, stake measurements and ice cores. Reasonable agreement regarding the surface and upper-air climate is achieved by the COSMO-CLM2 model, comparable to the performance of other state-of-the-art climate models over the AIS. Meteorological variability of the surface climate is adequately simulated, and biases in the radiation and surface mass balance are small. The presented model therefore contributes as a new member to the COordinated Regional Downscaling EXperiment project over the AIS (POLAR-CORDEX) and the CORDEX-CORE initiative.},

abstract = {The boreal summer Asian monsoon has been evaluated in 25 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-5 (CMIP5) and 22 CMIP3 GCM simulations of the late twentieth Century. Diagnostics and skill metrics have been calculated to assess the time-mean, climatological annual cycle, interannual variability, and intraseasonal variability. Progress has been made in modeling these aspects of the monsoon, though there is no single model that best represents all of these aspects of the monsoon. The CMIP5 multi-model mean (MMM) is more skillful than the CMIP3 MMM for all diagnostics in terms of the skill of simulating pattern correlations with respect to observations. Additionally, for rainfall/convection the MMM outperforms the individual models for the time mean, the interannual variability of the East Asian monsoon, and intraseasonal variability. The pattern correlation of the time (pentad) of monsoon peak and withdrawal is better simulated than that of monsoon onset. The onset of the monsoon over India is typically too late in the models. The extension of the monsoon over eastern China, Korea, and Japan is underestimated, while it is overestimated over the subtropical western/central Pacific Ocean. The anti-correlation between anomalies of all-India rainfall and Nio3.4 sea surface temperature is overly strong in CMIP3 and typically too weak in CMIP5. For both the ENSO-monsoon teleconnection and the East Asian zonal wind-rainfall teleconnection, the MMM interannual rainfall anomalies are weak compared to observations. Though simulation of intraseasonal variability remains problematic, several models show improved skill at representing the northward propagation of convection and the development of the tilted band of convection that extends from India to the equatorial west Pacific. The MMM also well represents the space-time evolution of intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation anomalies. Caution is necessary when using GPCP and CMAP rainfall to validate (1) the time-mean rainfall, as there are systematic differences over ocean and land between these two data sets, and (2) the timing of monsoon withdrawal over India, where the smooth southward progression seen in India Meteorological Department data is better realized in CMAP data compared to GPCP data.},

In this article, we analyze the spatial and temporal variability of 10 variables: minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, daily temperature range, precipitation, cloud cover, relative sunshine duration, relative humidity, surface air pressure, and wind speed at 2 m. For each variable, we present the gridded climatologies for the period 1961-2010 and discuss the linear trends both on an annual and seasonal basis. Temperature was found to increase in every season, in particular in the last three decades, confirming the trends occurring in Europe; wind speed decreased in every season; cloud cover and relative humidity decreased in spring, summer, and winter, and increased in autumn, while relative sunshine duration behaved in the opposite way; precipitation and surface air pressure showed no significant trend, though they increased slightly on an annual basis. We also discuss the correlation between the variables and we highlight that in the Carpathian Region positive and negative sunshine duration anomalies are highly correlated to the corresponding temperature anomalies during the global dimming (1960s and 1970s) and brightening (1990s and 2000s) periods.},

abstract = {Two questions motivated this study: 1) Will meteorological droughts become more frequent and severe during the twenty-first century? 2) Given the projected global temperature rise, to what extent does the inclusion of temperature (in addition to precipitation) in drought indicators play a role in future meteorological droughts? To answer, we analyzed the changes in drought frequency, severity, and historically undocumented extreme droughts over 1981–2100, using the standardized precipitation index (SPI; including precipitation only) and standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI; indirectly including temperature), and under two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). As input data, we employed 103 high-resolution (0.44°) simulations from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), based on a combination of 16 global circulation models (GCMs) and 20 regional circulation models (RCMs). This is the first study on global drought projections including RCMs based on such a large ensemble of RCMs. Based on precipitation only, {\~{}}15{\%} of the global land is likely to experience more frequent and severe droughts during 2071–2100 versus 1981–2010 for both scenarios. This increase is larger ({\~{}}47{\%} under RCP4.5, {\~{}}49{\%} under RCP8.5) when precipitation and temperature are used. Both SPI and SPEI project more frequent and severe droughts, especially under RCP8.5, over southern South America, the Mediterranean region, southern Africa, southeastern China, Japan, and southern Australia. A decrease in drought is projected for high latitudes in Northern Hemisphere and Southeast Asia. If temperature is included, drought characteristics are projected to increase over North America, Amazonia, central Europe and Asia, the Horn of Africa, India, and central Australia; if only precipitation is considered, they are found to decrease over those areas.},

Study focus: Drought is a complex climate-related phenomenon that can affect different sectors causing economic, social, and environmental impacts. We focus on meteorological and hydrological droughts, defined as shortage of precipitation over several months and we discuss the biggest drought events in 1950-2012. To define such drought events we computed three drought indicators, the Standardized Precipitation Index, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, and the Reconnaissance Drought Index and we merged them into a combined indicator at 3-month scale for meteorological and 12-month for hydrological droughts. The indicators have been calculated using the E-OBS gridded data (0.25°. ×. 0.25°). New hydrological insights for the region: Europe has been subdivided into thirteen regions and for each region we determined a list of drought events. The events have been characterized by the time, duration, severity, average area involved, peak month, and area involved at the peak month. We computed time series of the combined indicators for each region and country to determine the twenty-two biggest drought events in 1950-2012. Northern Europe and Russia show the highest drought frequency, duration, and severity in the 1950s and 1960s, where this is for the 1970s in Central Europe and the British Islands, and the 1990s and 2000s for the Mediterranean area and Baltic Republics.},

During the period 1901–2010, annual mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures averaged over the country as a whole exhibited a significant increasing trend of 0.60, 1.0, and 0.18 °C per hundred years, respectively. Further, the rate of increase in the annual mean temperatures since 1908s is much higher, mainly due to sharp increase in minimum temperatures. For the period 1981–2010, the increase in mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures was almost 0.2 °C per decade. On the seasonal scale, the highest increasing trend in the mean temperatures was observed in the postmonsoon and winter seasons, during the period of 1901–2010 and in the recent 30 years (1981–2010). Maximum and minimum temperatures over India showed an accelerated warming during the recent 30-year period (1981–2010). Further, the rise of the maximum and minimum temperatures, in the recent 30 years, is mostly confined to the northern, central, and eastern/northeastern parts of the country. Peninsular India experienced the least warming during the recent 30-year period (1981–2010). The annual upper-air temperature series for the country as a whole for the period 1971–2007 also showed significant increasing trend at the lower tropospheric levels, viz. 850 and 700 hPa levels.},

abstract = { AbstractA robust response of South Asian summer monsoon precipitation to increasing greenhouse gas concentration during the twenty-first century is identified in 23 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The pattern of this response is dominated by two dipole structures, one oriented east–west across the Maritime Continent and another oriented north–south across the equatorial Indian Ocean, and is characterized by enhanced rainfall in South Asia and diminished rainfall over the Maritime Continent. The response is robust in the sense that the same pattern has a trend that is within one standard deviation of the trend of other models. Another robust feature is that the variability of precipitation about this trend decreases in all models, and hence becomes more detectable with time. The response is negligible compared to internal variability during the twentieth century but emerges clearly by the middle of the twenty-first century. Although the pattern as a whole is robust, the response over small land areas such as India has more uncertainty, with some models disagreeing even with the sign of the response. },

abstract = {Freezing rain occurs in complex atmospheric conditions when the temperature is close to 0°C. To better understand how its occurrence will change in the future, there is a need to assess how well regional climate models can reproduce those conditions. The goal of the present study is to investigate the influence of horizontal resolution on the simulation of freezing rain using the fifth generation of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5). Three CRCM5 simulations driven by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) over eastern North America at resolutions of 0.11°, 0.22°, and 0.44° were conducted over a period of 36 years (1979–2014). Freezing rain is diagnosed using an in-line diagnostic method for precipitation partitioning. A climatological study of annual and seasonal accumulated freezing rain was conducted. In addition, the ability of the three simulations to reproduce individual freezing rain events was evaluated. Our analyses include frequency and partitioning of different precipitation types and comparisons with observations. All simulations reproduced the climatology of freezing rain sufficiently well and show similar large-scale patterns. The number of freezing rain events tends to be overestimated at higher resolution and underestimated at lower resolution. Despite the overestimation, detailed maxima associated with freezing rain are well defined and located at higher resolution, notably in regions of the St. Lawrence River Valley. Overall, this study is consistent with other added-value studies, generally showing a mix of improvement and deterioration in the precipitation fields by the higher resolution simulations.},

abstract = {An analysis is presented of an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) experiments from the ENSEMBLES project in terms of mean winter snow water equivalent (SWE), the seasonal evolution of snow cover, and the duration of the continuous snow cover season in the European Alps. Two sets of simulations are considered, one driven by GCMs assuming the SRES A1B greenhouse gas scenario for the period 1951-2099, and the other by the ERA-40 reanalysis for the recent past. The simulated SWE for Switzerland for the winters 1971-2000 is validated against an observational data set derived from daily snow depth measurements. Model validation shows that the RCMs are capable of simulating the general spatial and seasonal variability of Alpine snow cover, but generally underestimate snow at elevations below 1,000 m and overestimate snow above 1,500 m. Model biases in snow cover can partly be related to biases in the atmospheric forcing. The analysis of climate projections for the twenty first century reveals high inter-model agreement on the following points: The strongest relative reduction in winter mean SWE is found below 1,500 m, amounting to 40-80 {\%} by mid century relative to 1971-2000 and depending upon the model considered. At these elevations, mean winter temperatures are close to the melting point. At higher elevations the decrease of mean winter SWE is less pronounced but still a robust feature. For instance, at elevations of 2,000-2,500 m, SWE reductions amount to 10-60 {\%} by mid century and to 30-80 {\%} by the end of the century. The duration of the continuous snow cover season shows an asymmetric reduction with strongest shortening in springtime when ablation is the dominant factor for changes in SWE. We also find a substantial ensemble-mean reduction of snow reliability relevant to winter tourism at elevations below about 1,800 m by mid century, and at elevations below about 2,000 m by the end of the century. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Climate trends in the Antarctic region remain poorly characterized, owing to the brevity and scarcity of direct climate observations and the large magnitude of interannual to decadal-scale climate variability. Here, within the framework of the PAGES Antarctica2k working group, we build an enlarged database of ice core water stable isotope records from Antarctica, consisting of 112 records. We produce both unweighted and weighted isotopic (18O) composites and temperature reconstructions since 0 CE, binned at 5-A nd 10-year resolution, for seven climatically distinct regions covering the Antarctic continent. Following earlier work of the Antarctica2k working group, we also produce composites and reconstructions for the broader regions of East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the whole continent. We use three methods for our temperature reconstructions: (i) a temperature scaling based on the 18O-temperature relationship output from an ECHAM5-wiso model simulation nudged to ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalyses from 1979 to 2013, and adjusted for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet region to borehole temperature data, (ii) a temperature scaling of the isotopic normalized anomalies to the variance of the regional reanalysis temperature and (iii) a composite-plusscaling approach used in a previous continent-scale reconstruction of Antarctic temperature since 1 CE but applied to the new Antarctic ice core database. Our new reconstructions confirm a significant cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE across all Antarctic regions where records extend back into the 1st millennium, with the exception of the Wilkes Land coast and Weddell Sea coast regions. Within this long-term cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE, we find that the warmest period occurs between 300 and 1000 CE, and the coldest interval occurs from 1200 to 1900 CE. Since 1900 CE, significant warming trends are identified for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Dronning Maud Land coast and the Antarctic Peninsula regions, and these trends are robust across the distribution of records that contribute to the unweighted isotopic composites and also significant in the weighted temperature reconstructions. Only for the Antarctic Peninsula is this most recent century-scale trend unusual in the context of natural variability over the last 2000 years. However, projected warming of the Antarctic continent during the 21st century may soon see significant and unusual warming develop across other parts of the Antarctic continent. The extended Antarctica2k ice core isotope database developed by this working group opens up many avenues for developing a deeper understanding of the response of Antarctic climate to natural and anthropogenic climate forcings. The first long-term quantification of regional climate in Antarctica presented herein is a basis for data-model comparison and assessments of past, present and future driving factors of Antarctic climate.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A workshop was held at the University of the West Indies, Jamaica, in May 2012 to build capacity in climate data rescue and to enhance knowledge about climate change in the Caribbean region. Scientists brought their daily observational surface temperature and precipitation data from weather stations for an assessment of quality and homogeneity and for the calculation of climate indices helpful for studying climate change in their region. This study presents the trends in daily and extreme temperature and precipitation indices in the Caribbean region for records spanning the 1961–2010 and 1986–2010 intervals. Overall, the results show a warming of the surface air temperature at land stations. In general, the indices based on minimum temperature show stronger warming trends than indices calculated from maximum temperature. The frequency of warm days, warm nights and extreme high temperatures has increased while fewer cool days, cool nights and extreme low temperatures were found for both periods. Changes in precipitation indices are less consistent and the trends are generally weak. Small positive trends were found in annual total precipitation, daily intensity, maximum number of consecutive dry days and heavy rainfall events particularly during the period 1986–2010. Correlations between indices and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index suggest that temperature variability and, to a lesser extent, precipitation extremes are related to the AMO signal of the North Atlantic surface sea temperatures: stronger associations are found in August and September for the temperature indices and in June and October for some of the precipitation indices.},

abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report, published in 2007 came to a more confident assessment of the causes of global temperature change than previous reports and concluded that 'it is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent except Antarctica.' Since then, warming over Antarctica has also been attributed to human influence, and further evidence has accumulated attributing a much wider range of climate changes to human activities. Such changes are broadly consistent with theoretical understanding, and climate model simulations, of how the planet is expected to respond. This paper reviews this evidence from a regional perspective to reflect a growing interest in understanding the regional effects of climate change, which can differ markedly across the globe. We set out the methodological basis for detection and attribution and discuss the spatial scales on which it is possible to make robust attribution statements. We review the evidence showing significant human-induced changes in regional temperatures, and for the effects of external forcings on changes in the hydrological cycle, the cryosphere, circulation changes, oceanic changes, and changes in extremes. We then discuss future challenges for the science of attribution. To better assess the pace of change, and to understand more about the regional changes to which societies need to adapt, we will need to refine our understanding of the effects of external forcing and internal variability. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The model [Pan-African Convection-Permitting Regional Climate Simulation with the Met Office UM (CP4-Africa)] uses a 4.5-km horizontal grid spacing at the equator and is run without a convection parameterization, nested within a global atmospheric model driven by observations at the sea surface, which does include a convection scheme. An additional regional simulation, with identical resolution and physical parameterizations to the global model, but with the domain, land surface, and aerosol climatologies of CP4-Africa, has been run to aid in the understanding of the differences between the CP4-Africa and global model, in particular to isolate the impact of the convection parameterization and resolution. The effect of enforcing moisture conservation in CP4-Africa is described and its impact on reducing extreme precipitation values is assessed. Preliminary results from the first five years of the CP4-Africa simulation show substantial improvements in JJA average rainfall compared to the parameterized convection models, with most notably a reduction in the persistent dry bias in West Africa, giving an indication of the benefits to be gained from running a convection-permitting simulation over the whole African continent.},

abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO2 and resulting warming are expected to impact freshwater resources in the tropics, but few studies have documented how natural stream flow regimes in tropical watersheds will respond to changing rainfall patterns. To address this data gap, we utilized a space-for-time substitution across a naturally occurring and highly constrained (i.e., similar geomorphic, abiotic, and biotic features) model hydrological system encompassing a 3000mm mean annual rainfall (MAR) gradient on Hawai'i Island. We monitored stream flow at 15min intervals in 12 streams across these watersheds for two years (one normal and one dry) and calculated flow metrics describing the flow magnitude, flow variability (e.g., flow flashiness, zero flow days), and flow stability (e.g., deviations from Q90, daily flow range). A decrease in watershed MAR was associated with increased relative rainfall intensity, a greater number of days with zero rainfall resulting in more days with zero flow, and a decrease in Q90:Q50. Flow yield metrics increased with increasing MAR and correlations with MAR were generally stronger in the normal rainfall year compared to the dry year, suggesting that stream flow metrics are less predictable in drier conditions. Compared to the normal rainfall year, during the dry year, Q50 declined and the number of zero flow days increased, while coefficient of variation increased in most streams despite a decrease in stream flashiness due to fewer high flow events. This suggests that if MAR changes, stream flow regimes in tropical watersheds will also shift, with implications for water supply to downstream users and in stream habitat quality for aquatic organisms. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The surface temperature response to greenhouse gas forcing displays a characteristic pattern of polar-amplified warming1–5, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the causes of this polar amplification are still debated. Some studies highlight the importance of surface-albedo feedback6–8, while others find larger contributions from longwave feedbacks4,9,10, with changes in atmospheric and oceanic heat transport also thought to play a role11–16. Here, we determine the causes of polar amplification using climate model simulations in which CO2 forcing is prescribed in distinct geographical regions, with the linear sum of climate responses to regional forcings replicating the response to global forcing. The degree of polar amplification depends strongly on the location of CO2 forcing. In particular, polar amplification is found to be dominated by forcing in the polar regions, specifically through positive local lapse-rate feedback, with ice-albedo and Planck feedbacks playing subsidiary roles. Extra-polar forcing is further shown to be conducive to polar warming, but given that it induces a largely uniform warming pattern through enhanced poleward heat transport, it contributes little to polar amplification. Therefore, understanding polar amplification requires primarily a better insight into local forcing and feedbacks rather than extra-polar processes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper contributes to knowledge of the impact of global warming on viticulture, using major vineyard regions of New Zealand as a case study to illustrate regional disparities in climate change impacts resulting from downscale effects of larger scale atmospheric circulation. Recent trends in air temperature in New Zealand vineyard areas are investigated. Trends since 1941 in Marlborough show an increase in temperature range, with both rising maximum temperatures and declining minimum temperatures, but no change in the annual mean. More hot days and frosts are of concern to viticulturalists, and this trend not only differs from other major vineyard areas, but also occurs at other sites in eastern parts of the country. The relationship between changes in atmospheric circulation over New Zealand and observed trends in temperature and frost occurrence at Blenheim is investigated using the Kidson weather type classification for the period 1958–2010 and the Trenberth M1 index. The increased temperature range is expected to be associated with more frequent clear skies along the east coast of the country, resulting from changes in weather patterns (more frequent anticyclones, fewer low-pressure systems, increased zonal and southerly flow). These changes in weather patterns are shown to be closely linked to larger scale changes in atmospheric circulation via the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Southern Oscillation. The results show that significant regional variations in the impact of global warming can occur over areas of complex terrain such as New Zealand. Observed differences in local temperature and frost trends can be caused by the interaction of changing weather systems with mountainous terrain. These changing weather systems themselves are seen to be the result of major shifts in the larger scale atmospheric circulation. These results are important for assessing possible impacts on viticulture and in developing adaptation strategies for agriculture in response to predicted future climates.},

However, the host-pathogen interaction remains to be well understood. In this work, 33 colostrum-deprived pigs were divided in 4 groups and each group was inoculated intranasally with a different H. parasuis strain (non-virulent strains SW114 and F9, and virulent strains Nagasaki and IT29755). Animals were necropsied at different times in order to determine the location of the bacteria in the respiratory tract of the host during infection. An immunohistochemistry method was developed to detect H. parasuis in nasal turbinates, trachea and lung. Also, the co-localization of H. parasuis with macrophages or neutrophils was examined by double immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence. Virulent strains showed a biofilm-like growth in nasal turbinates and trachea and were found easily in lung. Some virulent bacteria were detected in association with macrophages and neutrophils, but also inside pneumocyte-like cells. On the other hand, non-virulent strains were seldom detected in nasal turbinates and trachea, where they showed a microcolony pattern. Non-virulent strains were essentially not detected in lung. In conclusion, this work presents data showing differential localization of H. parasuis bacteria depending on their virulence. Interestingly, the intracellular location of virulent H. parasuis bacteria in non-phagocytic cells in lung could allow the persistence of the bacteria and constitute a virulence mechanism.},

abstract = {Regional precipitation patterns may change in a warmer climate, thereby increasing flood and drought risks. In this paper, annual, annual maximum, intense, heavy, moderate, light, and trace precipitation are employed as indicators to assess changes in precipitation patterns under two scenarios in which the global mean temperature increases by 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C relative to pre-industrial levels using the regional climate model COSMO-CLM (CCLM). The results show that annual precipitation in China will be approximately 2.5{\%} higher under 1.5 °C warming relative to the present-day baseline (1980–2009), although it will decrease by approximately 4.0{\%} under an additional 0.5 °C increase in global mean temperature. This trend is spatially consistent for regions with annual precipitation of 400–800 mm, which has experienced a drying trend during the past half century; thus, limiting global warming to 1.5 °C may mitigate these drying conditions. The annual maximum precipitation continues to increase from present day levels to the 2.0 °C warming scenario. Relative to the baseline period, the frequency of trace and light precipitation days exhibits a negative trend, while that of moderate, heavy, and intense precipitation days has a positive trend under the 1.5 °C warming scenario. For the 2.0 °C warming world, the frequency of days is projected to decrease for all precipitation categories, although the intensity of intense precipitation increases. Spatially, a decrease in the number of precipitation days is expected to continue in central and northern China, where a drying trend has persisted over the past half century. Southeastern China, which already suffers greatly from flooding, is expected to face more heavy and intense precipitation with an additional 0.5 °C increase in global mean temperature. Meanwhile, the intensity of intense precipitation is expected to increase in northern China, and the contribution of light and moderate precipitation to the annual precipitation is expected to decrease in southeastern China. Therefore, flood risk in northern China and drought risk in southern China should draw more attention for a global air temperature increase from 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C.},

abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the climatic condition and synoptic regimes of two intense snowfall events (ISEs) in central eastern China (CEC) during January 2018, focusing on the mechanisms of northerly cold advection and southerly water vapor transport. The northerly cold advections invading CEC were associated with a strengthened Siberian High, which could be partially attributed to an influence of reduced sea ice in the Kara Sea-Barents Sea during November 2017 to January 2018 on a reduced meridional temperature gradient between the midlatitudinal Eurasia and Arctic regions. The southerly water vapor transport contributing to ISEs was associated with a zonal dipole pattern in the atmosphere, which was characterized by an anomalous anticyclone over the western North Pacific and an anomalous low over the Tibetan Plateau and India. The La Ni{\~{n}}a condition provided a climatic condition for an anomalous anticyclone persisting over the western North Pacific during January 2018, which was influenced by a strengthened convection over the western tropical Pacific and influenced by the air-sea interaction over the central-northern Pacific. The anomalous low over the Tibetan Plateau and India was associated with active eastward propagating synoptic-scale waves originating from the midlatitudinal North Atlantic. The implication of aforementioned climatic conditions on climate variability was further discussed. Our results suggest that a reduced sea ice in the Kara Sea during the preceding late autumn and a concurrent La Ni{\~{n}}a-like condition may contribute to an increased frequency of ISEs in CEC during winter on the interannual time scale.},

Eight ensemble members, representing a subset of archived CORDEX-SEA simulations at 25 km spatial resolution, were examined for emission scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The study utilised four different indicators of rainfall extreme, i.e. the annual/seasonal rainfall total (PRCPTOT), consecutive dry days (CDD), frequency of extremely heavy rainfall (R50mm) and annual/seasonal maximum of daily rainfall (RX1day). In general, changes in extreme indices are more pronounced and covering wider area under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5. The decrease in annual PRCPTOT is projected over most of SEA region, except for Myanmar and Northern Thailand, with magnitude as much as 20{\%} (30{\%}) under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario. The most significant and robust changes were noted in CDD, which is projected to increase by as much as 30{\%} under RCP4.5 and 60{\%} under RCP8.5, particularly over Maritime Continent (MC). The projected decrease in PRCPTOT over MC is significant and robust during June to August (JJA) and September to November (SON). During March to May (MAM) under RCP8.5, significant and robust PRCPTOT decreases are also projected over Indochina. The CDD changes during JJA and SON over MC are even higher, more robust and significant compared to the annual changes. At the same time, a wetting tendency is also projected over Indochina. The R50mm and RX1day are projected to increase, during all seasons with significant and robust signal of RX1day during JJA and SON.},

Daily precipitation data from 97 stations across Indonesia covering the period from 1981 to 2012 were used to investigate the effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a on extreme precipitation characteristics including intensity, frequency and duration, as defined based on a subset of the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Although anomalous signals in these three indices were consistent with those of total rainfall, anomalies in the duration of extremes [i.e., consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD)] were much more robust. El Ni{\~{n}}o impacts were particularly prominent during June–July–August (JJA) and September–October–November (SON), when anomalously dry conditions were experienced throughout the country. However, from SON, a wet anomaly appeared over northern Sumatra, later expanding eastward during December–January–February (DJF) and March–April–May (MAM), creating contrasting conditions of wet in the west and dry in the east. We attribute this apparent eastward expansion of a wet anomaly during El Ni{\~{n}}o progression to the equatorial convergence of two anti-cyclonic circulations, one residing north of the equator and the other south of the equator. These anti-cyclonic circulations strengthen and weaken according to seasonal changes and their coupling with regional seas, hence shaping moisture transport and convergence. During La Ni{\~{n}}a events, the eastward expansion of an opposite (i.e., dry) anomaly was also present but less prominent than that of El Ni{\~{n}}o. We attribute this to differences in regional ocean—atmosphere coupling, which result in the contrasting seasonal evolution of the two corresponding anomalous cyclonic circulations and in turn suggests the strong nonlinearity of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a responses over the Maritime Continent. Based on the seasonal behaviour of anomalous CDD and CWD, we propose five sub-divisions of the Indonesian region for both El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a.},

The extreme indices were calculated based on the quality controlled daily observational data (minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation) from 88 weather stations. Overall, we found significant and spatially coherent trends of warming in the temperature indices over Indonesia, consistent with other studies conducted at different countries within the Southeast Asia. The frequency of cool days (TX10p) and cools nights (TN10p) had decreased whereas warm days (TX90p) and warm nights (TN90p) were observed more frequently. Averaged over the country, the annual mean of daily maximum (TXmean) and minimum temperature (TNmean) had increased significantly by 0.18 and 0.30 °C decade−1, respectively. Other temperature indices also showed significant warming trends. In contrast, trends in the precipitation extremes indices were generally not significant and less spatially coherent. However, a tendency towards wetter conditions was observed, in agreement with the results at the global scale. The daily precipitation intensity (SDII) had increased significantly over the country by 0.21 mm day−1 decade−1 during the period studied. At the regional scale, we observed a significant wetting trend in the annual highest daily amount (RX1day) and the rainfall amount contributed by the extremely very wet days (R99p) in the northern part of the country. The wetting trends of a number of extreme precipitation indices were depicted prominently in December–January–February (DJF) and/or March–April–May (MAM) seasons, both at country and regional levels.

Output from seven fully coupled global climate models is used from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Snowfall trends over the entire study area, and in the defined LI snowbelt, are examined seasonally for two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. The term lake-induced is used to encompass both lake effect processes, along with lake-enhanced snow. In addition to snowfall, physical mechanisms associated with these trends, such as surface temperatures and snow to total precipitation ratios, are examined. The models perform well when compared to snowfall observations despite model difficulties in resolving small-scale orographic and lake effect processes. Modelled snowfall declines by 20-45{\%} over the entire region by 2100, with snowfall increasing in the LI belt during the first quarter century before declining rapidly in RCP 8.5. An additional statistically significant 1.8-1.97 cm signal of LI snow water equivalent is detected within the ensemble mean of the defined snowbelt to the lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario that is not seen in the grid cells outside of the lake belt. This LI signal is also projected to decline more quickly than the non-lake-induced signal. Surface 2-m temperature is found to have a significant impact on snowfall changes in the region, with impacts not only on total precipitation but also on the percentage of precipitation falling as snow.},

The differences between the observational datasets over South-Asia are also analyzed. The spatial and the quantitative analysis over the selected climatic regions of South-Asia for the mean climate and the inter-annual variability of temperature, precipitation and circulation show that the RCMs have systematic biases which are independent from different driving datasets and seems to come from the physics parameterization of the RCMs. The spatial gradients and topographically-induced structure of climate are generally captured and simulated values are within a few degrees of the observed values. The biases in the RCMs are not consistent with the biases in the driving fields and the models show similar spatial patterns after downscaling different global datasets. The annual cycle of temperature and rainfall is well simulated by the RCMs, however the RCMs are not able to capture the inter-annual variability. ECHAM5 is also downscaled for the future (2071--2100) climate under A1B emission scenario. The climate change signal is consistent between ECHAM5 and RCMs. There is warming over all the regions of South-Asia associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and the increase in summer mean surface air temperature by the end of the century ranges from 2.5 to 5 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C, with maximum warming over north western parts of the domain and 30 {\%} increase in rainfall over north eastern India, Bangladesh and Myanmar.},

abstract = {Estimating climate change impacts on water resources in West Africa has been challenged by hydrological data scarcity and inconsistencies in the available climate projections. In this study, multi-model ensembles of the most recent global and regional climate models output are used to simulate the hydrologic impacts of climate change in five major river basins (i.e. Senegal, Gambia, Volta, Niger and Chad) that comprise most of West Africa. Under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5, the results consistently project substantial decreases (10 to 40{\%}) in potential water availability across the five major river basins. The largest changes are projected to occur in the Senegal basin, Gambia basin and the Sahelian part of the other river basins. The negative trends are steepest after 2050 and in the higher greenhouse gas forcing scenario. Therefore, in a business-as-usual world, reduced water availability combined with the region's rapidly growing population will have West Africa facing an unprecedented water deficit during the second half of the twenty-first century. However, greenhouse gas mitigation can help reduce this deficit. In the Volta basin, although potential water availability declines considerably, precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration during the monsoon season in both forcing scenarios, suggesting opportunities for adaptation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. The West African climate has evolved in recent decades to respond to elevated anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. An assessment of its recent trends and future changes is presented here based on various data sources (observations and models), along with an extensive review of recent literature including the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. A gradual warming spatially variable reaching 0.5 °C per decade in recent years is observed. In addition, the Sahel has recovered from the previous drought episodes (i.e., 1970s and 1980s); however, the precipitation amount is not at the level of the pre-drought period. Although these features are common across the different data sources, their magnitudes differ from one source to the other due to a lack of reliable observation systems. Projected climate change indicates continuous and stronger warming (1.5–6.5 °C) and a wider range of precipitation uncertainty (roughly between −30 and 30 {\%}) larger in the Sahel and increasing in the farther future. However, the spatial distribution unveils significant precipitation decrease confined to the westernmost Sahel and becoming greater and more extensive in the high level GHG forcing scenario by the end of the 21st century. This coexists with a substantial increase in both dry spell length and extreme precipitation intensity. West Sahel is thus the most sensitive region to anthropogenic climate change. The rest of West Africa also experiences more intense extremes in future climate but to a lesser extent. It is also reported from other previous studies that the projected rainy season and the growing season will become shorter while the torrid, arid and semi-arid climate conditions will substantially extend. It is thus evident that in a “business as usual” World, most countries in West Africa will have to cope with shorter rainy seasons, generalized torrid, arid and semi-arid conditions, longer dry spells and more intense extreme precipitations. Such conditions can produce significant stresses on agricultural activities, water resources management, ecosystem services and urban areas planning. However, some GHG mitigation (i.e., a mid-level forcing) could help to reduce the stress.},

abstract = {We intercompare three gridded observed daily rainfall datasets over Africa (FEWS (Famine Early Warning System), GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project) and TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission)) in order to assess uncertainties in observation products towards the evaluation of the performance of a Regional Climate Model (RegCM3) in simulating daily precipitation characteristics over a domain encompassing the whole African continent. We find that different observation products exhibit substantial systematic differences in mean rainfall, but especially in higher order daily precipitation statistics, such as frequency of wet days, precipitation intensity and extremes as well as maximum length of wet and dry spells. For example, FEWS shows mostly higher frequency and lower intensity events than TRMM and GPCP. Thus, the different datasets provide quite different representations of daily precipitation behavior. As a result, although RegCM3 captures pretty well the monsoon rainband evolution and exhibits a representation of daily precipitation statistics within the range of the observations, it performs differently with respect to the various products. For instance, it simulates more intense but less frequent events over East and Southern Africa than in FEWS and vice versa compared to TRMM. We thus highlight the uncertainty in observations as a key factor preventing a rigorous and unambiguous evaluation of climate models over Africa. Improving the quality and consistency of observation products is thus paramount for a better understanding of the response of African climate to global warming.},

We examined the underlying processes using a climate model and analysis. The enhanced Meiyu-Baiu rainfall was reasonably predicted by the climate model initialized at the end of April. The sensitivity experiment indicated that Indian Ocean (IO) warming enhanced the Meiyu-Baiu rainfall. Moreover, we found that the warm IO condition can be traced back to the super Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in 2019. The IO warmth was influenced by successive processes: record strong downwelling Rossby waves excited by the IOD and tripole sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical IO-western Pacific, their arrival to the southwestern IO in spring, and associated modulation of monsoon flow. The results suggest that the seasonal predictability of the Meiyu-Baiu rainfall in 2020 originated from the super IOD.},

abstract = {As part of the CORDEX project, the fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) is used over the Arctic for climate simulations driven by reanalyses and by the MPI-ESM-MR coupled global climate model (CGCM) under the RCP8.5 scenario. The CRCM5 shows adequate skills capturing general features of mean sea level pressure (MSLP) for all seasons. Evaluating 2-m temperature (T2m) and precipitation is more problematic, because of inconsistencies between observational reference datasets over the Arctic that suffer of a sparse distribution of weather stations. In our study, we additionally investigated the effect of large-scale spectral nudging (SN) on the hindcast simulation driven by reanalyses. The analysis shows that SN is effective in reducing the spring MSLP bias, but otherwise it has little impact. We have also conducted another experiment in which the CGCM-simulated sea-surface temperature (SST) is empirically corrected and used as lower boundary conditions over the ocean for an atmosphere-only global simulation (AGCM), which in turn provides the atmospheric lateral boundary conditions to drive the CRCM5 simulation. This approach, so-called 3-step approach of dynamical downscaling (CGCM-AGCM-RCM), which had considerably improved the CRCM5 historical simulations over Africa, exhibits reduced impact over the Arctic domain. The most notable positive effect over the Arctic is a reduction of the T2m bias over the North Pacific Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean in all seasons. Future projections using this method are compared with the results obtained with the traditional 2-step dynamical downscaling (CGCM-RCM) to assess the impact of correcting systematic biases of SST upon future-climate projections. The future projections are mostly similar for the two methods, except for precipitation.},

Four ensemble methods, namely, the equal weighting, the weighted mean, the reliability ensemble averaging, and the performance-based ensemble averaging, are employed to generate the multi-model projection of regional climate change over the region. The results show that the regional temperature ensembles of the present climate obtained from all four methods can outperform a single RCM result in aspects of the spatial distribution as well as the seasonal variation over East Asia. The four ensemble methods are then used to project the regional temperature climatology under the IPCC emission scenario of A1B for 2041–2060. Compared with the control climate of 1981–2000, the annual mean temperature of the future climate (2041–2060) increases 1–2 °C in low latitude areas and 2–3 °C in middle–high latitude areas over Asia.},

A total of 11 General Circulation Models (GCMs) have been downscaled using 7 Regional Climate Models (RCMs) to a resolution of 25 km × 25 km over the SEA domain (89.5° E–146.5° E, 14.8° S–27.0° N) for two different representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The 1976–2005 period is considered as the historical period for evaluating the changes in seasonal precipitation of December–January–February (DJF) and June–July–August (JJA) over future periods of the early (2011–2040), mid (2041–2070) and late twenty-first century (2071–2099). The ensemble mean shows a good reproduction of the SEA climatological mean spatial precipitation pattern with systematic wet biases, which originated largely from simulations using the RegCM4 model. Increases in mean rainfall (10–20{\%}) are projected throughout the twenty-first century over Indochina and eastern Philippines during DJF while a drying tendency prevails over the Maritime Continent. For JJA, projections of both RCPs indicate reductions in mean rainfall (10–30{\%}) over the Maritime Continent, particularly over the Indonesian region by mid and late twenty-first century. However, examination of individual member responses shows prominent inter-model variations, reflecting uncertainty in the projections.},

Results indicate that the most prominent changes during the period of 2031–2051 were largely significant. Robust increases in CDD imply impending drier conditions over Indonesia, while increases in RX1day suggest more intense rainfall events over most of Indo- china under 2°C global warming scenario.

The extreme indices were a subset of the Expert Team for Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) that covers the duration, frequency and intensity aspects of precipitation extremes. Seasonal composites of ‘El Ni{\~{n}}o minus neutral' and ‘La Ni{\~{n}}a minus neutral' years of these indices were computed based on El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a occurrences during the period. The results showed that the ENSO-related variations in precipitation extremes were generally coherent with the variations in total precipitation. Generally, dry (wet) precipitation extremes tended to enhance during El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a); however, this was dependent on season and location. The El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a influences on precipitation extremes were not entirely linear. While the impacts of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a were generally opposite for most locations and seasons, there were cases where both exerted in-phase influences. The impacts were also dependent on the intensity of the event itself. While the El Ni{\~{n}}o impacts were generally coherent across different intensities, La Ni{\~{n}}a can have entirely different impacts among different categories. During December–January–February (DJF), strong (moderate) La Ni{\~{n}}a caused a significant decrease (increase) in wet precipitation extremes over the Peninsular Malaysia. This was related to the broadening (narrowing and westward displacement) of the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the western north Pacific during strong (moderate) La Ni{\~{n}}a. Hence, the likelihood for widespread flooding over the east coast of the Peninsular Malaysia during DJF increases during moderate but not during strong La Ni{\~{n}}a events.},

The global warming targets are attained by the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s respectively for RCP4.5. The Caribbean on average exhibits smaller mean surface air temperature increases than the globe, although there are parts of the region that are always warmer than the global warming targets. In comparison to the present (using a 1971–2000 baseline), the Caribbean domain is 0.5° to 1.5°C warmer at the 1.5°C target, 5{\%}–10{\%} wetter except for the northeast and southeast Caribbean, which are drier, and experiences increases in annual warm spells of more than 100 days. At the 2.0°C target, there is additional warming by 0.2°–1.0°C, a further extension of warm spells by up to 70 days, a shift to a predominantly drier region (5{\%}–15{\%} less than present day), and a greater occurrence of droughts. The climate patterns at 2.5°C indicate an intensification of the changes seen at 2.0°C. The shift in the rainfall pattern between 1.5°C (wet) and 2.0°C (dry) for parts of the domain has implications for regional adaptation pursuits. The results provide some justification for the lobby by the Caribbean Community and Small Island Developing States to limit global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels, as embodied in the slogan “1.5 to Stay Alive.”},

abstract = {The fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) will produce a state-of-the- art multimodel dataset designed to advance our knowledge of climate variability and climate change. Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.},

abstract = { By the beginning of the current century, there was heightened recognition that the Caribbean is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Yet, there was very little climate change science information for the region and at the scale of the small islands that make up most of the region. To fill the gap, a group of regional scientists representing three institutions and four territories (Barbados, Belize, Cuba, and Jamaica) initiated a project to provide dynamically downscaled climate change information for the Caribbean. The Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS)-Caribbean initiative was premised on a shared workload with goals to build regional capacity to provide climate change information for the region from within the region, to provide much needed climate information in the shortest possible time frame, and to create a platform for sharing the information as widely as possible. Ten years later offers the opportunity for retrospection and evaluation, particularly since a phase 2 initiative is being formulated. By both accident and design, the legacies of the PRECIS-Caribbean initiative include i) the positioning of the Caribbean to pose and answer for itself some of the emerging second-generation climate change questions; ii) the emergence of a regional template for capacity building in the sciences through cooperation; iii) an expanded regional capacity to undertake climate science; and iv) a significant body of climate change and climate science knowledge relevant to and at the scale of the Caribbean region. },

It serves as a solid scientific basis for further research related to vulnerability, impact, adaptation and climate services in addition to existing CORDEX simulations. The aim of this study is to investigate and document the climate change information provided by the CORDEX-CORE simulation ensemble, as a part of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) CORDEX community. An overview of the annual and monthly mean climate change information in selected regions in different CORDEX domains is presented for temperature and precipitation, providing the foundation for detailed follow-up studies and applications. Initially, two regional climate models (RCMs), REMO and RegCM were used to downscale global climate model output. The driving simulations by AR5 global climate models (AR5-GCMs) were selected to cover the spread of high, medium, and low equilibrium climate sensitivity at a global scale. The CORDEX-CORE ensemble has doubled the spatial resolution compared to the previously existing CORDEX simulations in most of the regions (25 {\$}{\$}$\backslash$,$\backslash$mathrm {\{}km{\}}{\$}{\$} km (0.22 {\$}{\$}{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$circ {\}}{\$}{\$} ∘ ) versus 50 {\$}{\$}$\backslash$,$\backslash$mathrm {\{}km{\}}{\$}{\$} km (0.44 {\$}{\$}{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$circ {\}}{\$}{\$} ∘ )) leading to a potentially improved representation of, e.g., physical processes in the RCMs. The analysis focuses on changes in the IPCC physical climate reference regions. The results show a general reasonable representation of the spread of the temperature and precipitation climate change signals of the AR5-GCMs by the CORDEX-CORE simulations in the investigated regions in all CORDEX domains by mostly covering the AR5 interquartile range of climate change signals. The simulated CORDEX-CORE monthly climate change signals mostly follow the AR5-GCMs, although for specific regions they show a different change in the course of the year compared to the AR5-GCMs, especially for RCP8.5, which needs to be investigated further in region specific process studies.},

abstract = {The need to restrict global mean temperature to avoid irreversible climate change is supported by scientific evidence. The need became political practice at the Conference of the Parties in 2015, where the participants decided to limit global warming to not more than +2.0 °C compared to pre-industrial times and to rather aim for a limit of +1.5 °C global warming. Nevertheless, a clear picture of what European climate would look like under +1.5 °C, +2.0 °C and +3.0 °C global warming level (GWL) is still missing. In this study, we will fill this gap by assessing selected climate indices related to temperature and precipitation extremes, based on state of the art regional climate information for Europe taken from the European branch of the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) ensemble. To assess the impact of these indices under climate change, we investigate the spatial extent of the area of the climate change signal in relation to the affected population. This allows us to demonstrate which climate extremes could be avoided when global warming is kept well below +2.0 °C or even +1.5 °C compared to higher GWLs. The European north–south gradient of tropical nights and hot days is projected to be intensified with an increasing global warming level. For precipitation-related indices, an overall increase in precipitation extremes is simulated, especially under +3.0 °C GWL, for mid- and northern Europe, whereas an increase in dry days is projected for many regions in southern Europe. The benefit of staying below +1.5 °C GWL compared to +2.0 °C GWL is the avoidance of an additional increase in tropical nights and hot days parallel to an increase in dry days in parts of southern Europe as well as an increase in heavy precipitation in parts of Scandinavia. Compared to +3.0 °C GWL, the benefit of staying at +1.5 °C GWL is to avoid a substantial increase (i.e., an increase of more than five dry days and ten tropical nights) in dry days and tropical nights in southern European regions, while, in several European regions and especially in northern Europe, a substantial increase (i.e., more than two heavy precipitation days) in heavy precipitation days could be avoided. This study shows that a statistically significant change in the investigated climate indices can be avoided under +1.5 °C GWL compared to the investigated higher GWLs +2.0 °C and +3.0 °C for the majority of the population in almost all regions. Future studies will investigate compound events where the severity of single extreme events is intensified.},

abstract = {Abstract. The estimate of the current and future conditions of snow resources in mountain areas would require reliable, kilometre-resolution, regional-observation-based gridded data sets and climate models capable of properly representing snow processes and snow–climate interactions. At the moment, the development of such tools is hampered by the sparseness of station-based reference observations. In past decades passive microwave remote sensing and reanalysis products have mainly been used to infer information on the snow water equivalent distribution. However, the investigation has usually been limited to flat terrains as the reliability of these products in mountain areas is poorly characterized. This work considers the available snow water equivalent data sets from remote sensing and from reanalyses for the greater Alpine region (GAR), and explores their ability to provide a coherent view of the snow water equivalent distribution and climatology in this area. Further we analyse the simulations from the latest-generation regional and global climate models (RCMs, GCMs), participating in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment over the European domain (EURO-CORDEX) and in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) respectively. We evaluate their reliability in reproducing the main drivers of snow processes – near-surface air temperature and precipitation – against the observational data set EOBS, and compare the snow water equivalent climatology with the remote sensing and reanalysis data sets previously considered. We critically discuss the model limitations in the historical period and we explore their potential in providing reliable future projections. The results of the analysis show that the time-averaged spatial distribution of snow water equivalent and the amplitude of its annual cycle are reproduced quite differently by the different remote sensing and reanalysis data sets, which in fact exhibit a large spread around the ensemble mean. We find that GCMs at spatial resolutions equal to or finer than 1.25° longitude are in closer agreement with the ensemble mean of satellite and reanalysis products in terms of root mean square error and standard deviation than lower-resolution GCMs. The set of regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble provides estimates of snow water equivalent at 0.11° resolution that are locally much larger than those indicated by the gridded data sets, and only in a few cases are these {\ldots}},

abstract = {Climate reanalyses provide key information to calibrate proxy records in regions with scarce direct observations. The climate reanalysis used to perform a proxy calibration should accurately reproduce the local climate variability. Here we present a regional scale evaluation of meteorological parameters using ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalyses compared to in-situ observations from 13 automatic weather stations (AWS), located in the southern Antarctic Peninsula and Ellsworth Land, Antarctica. Both reanalyses seem to perform better in the escarpment area ({\textgreater}1000 m a.s.l) than on the coast. A significant improvement is observed in the performance of ERA5 over ERA-Interim. ERA5 is highly accurate, representing the magnitude and variability of near-surface air temperature and wind regimes. The higher spatial and temporal resolution provided by ERA5 reduces significantly the cold coastal biases identified in ERA-Interim and increases the accuracy representing the wind direction and wind speed in the escarpment. The slight underestimation in the wind speed obtained from the reanalyses could be attributed to an interplay of topographic factors and the effect of local wind regimes. Three sites in this region are highlighted for their potential for ice core studies. These sites are likely to provide accurate proxy calibrations for future palaeoclimatic reconstructions.},

abstract = {Abstract. Here we present Antarctic snow accumulation variability at the regional scale over the past 1000 years. A total of 79 ice core snow accumulation records were gathered and assigned to seven geographical regions, separating the high-accumulation coastal zones below 2000 m of elevation from the dry central Antarctic Plateau. The regional composites of annual snow accumulation were evaluated against modelled surface mass balance (SMB) from RACMO2.3p2 and precipitation from ERA-Interim reanalysis. With the exception of the Weddell Sea coast, the low-elevation composites capture the regional precipitation and SMB variability as defined by the models. The central Antarctic sites lack coherency and either do not represent regional precipitation or indicate the model inability to capture relevant precipitation processes in the cold, dry central plateau. Our results show that SMB for the total Antarctic Ice Sheet (including ice shelves) has increased at a rate of 7 ± 0.13 Gt decade−1 since 1800 AD, representing a net reduction in sea level of ∼ 0.02 mm decade−1 since 1800 and ∼ 0.04 mm decade−1 since 1900 AD. The largest contribution is from the Antarctic Peninsula (∼ 75 {\%}) where the annual average SMB during the most recent decade (2001–2010) is 123 ± 44 Gt yr−1 higher than the annual average during the first decade of the 19th century. Only four ice core records cover the full 1000 years, and they suggest a decrease in snow accumulation during this period. However, our study emphasizes the importance of low-elevation coastal zones, which have been under-represented in previous investigations of temporal snow accumulation.},

abstract = {The recent decline in Horn of Africa rainfall during the March-May "long rains" season has fomented drought and famine, threatening food security in an already vulnerable region. Some attribute this decline to anthropogenic forcing, whereas others maintain that it is a feature of internal climate variability. We show that the rate of drying in the Horn of Africa during the 20th century is unusual in the context of the last 2000 years, is synchronous with recent global and regional warming, and therefore may have an anthropogenic component. In contrast to 20th century drying, climate models predict that the Horn of Africa will become wetter as global temperatures rise. The projected increase in rainfall mainly occurs during the September-November "short rains" season, in response to large-scale weakening of the Walker circulation. Most of the models overestimate short rains precipitation while underestimating long rains precipitation, causing the Walker circulation response to unrealistically dominate the annual mean. Our results highlight the need for accurate simulation of the seasonal cycle and an improved understanding of the dynamics of the long rains season to predict future rainfall in the Horn of Africa.},

abstract = {Abstract Seasonal mean rainfall projections for Hawai‘i are given based on statistical downscaling of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) global model results for two future representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The spatial information content of our statistical downscaling method is improved over previous efforts through the inclusion of spatially extensive, high-quality monthly rainfall data set and the use of improved large-scale climate predictor information. Predictor variables include moisture transport in the middle atmosphere (700 hPa), vertical temperature gradients, and geopotential height fields of the 1000 and 500 hPa layers. The results allow for the first time to derive a spatially interpolated map with future rainfall change estimates for the main Hawaiian Islands. The statistical downscaling was applied to project wet (November–April) and dry (May–October) season rainfall anomalies for the middle and late 21st century. Overall, the statistical downscaling gives more reliable results for the wet season than for the dry season. The wet-season results indicate a pronounced dipole structure between windward facing mountain slopes and the leeward side of most of the islands. The climatically wet regions on the windward slopes of the mountain regions are expected to become wetter or remain stable in their seasonal precipitation amounts. On the climatically dry leeward sides of Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Maui, and Hawai‘i Island, future precipitation exhibits the strongest drying trends. The projected future rainfall anomaly pattern is associated with a circulation anomaly that resembles a shift in the position or strength of the subtropical high and the average location of extratropical troughs. These new results suggest that a negative trend dominates the area-averaged changes in the statistical downscaling over the Hawaiian Islands. However, the islands are expected to experience a greater contrast between the wet and dry regions in the future.},

abstract = {This study investigates the greenhouse gas-induced winter and summer precipitation change signals over the Carpathian region with special focus on topographical effects and underlying processes. Six high-resolution ({\~{}}12 km grid spacing) regional climate model projections are analyzed for the future period 2070–2099 with respect to the reference period 1976–2005 under the RCP8.5 scenarios. We find that the topographically induced fine scale modulation of the precipitation change signal is mostly of dynamical nature in winter (due to the precipitation shadowing effect), and thermodynamical in summer (associated with high elevation convection) over the region of interest. Additionally, elevation, size, and orientation of mountains play key roles in such processes. Our results draw attention to the fact that the high-resolution representation of topography in climate models is crucial for the provision of fine scale precipitation projections in mountainous regions.},

An increase in total expenses for forest fire extinction is expected by the end of the century as a result of climate-related changes in fire danger in the Russian Federation subjects. The economic assessment of possible damage due to wildfires shows that the average total cost of forest fire management in Russia can increase under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 radiative forcing scenarios by 211114 and 248956 thousand rubles.

abstract = {Abstract A new version of the long-term Australian temperature data set, known as ACORN-SAT (Australian Climate Observations Reference Network—Surface Air Temperature), has been developed. ACORN-SAT includes homogenized daily maximum and minimum temperature data from 112 locations across Australia, encompassing the period from 1910 to the present, with 60 of the locations having data for the full 1910–2018 period. Homogenization is achieved using a percentile-matching methodology with a number of improvements beyond practices used in previous versions, including more effective detection and removal of potentially inhomogeneous reference stations and an enhanced breakpoint detection methodology. Explicit corrections have also been introduced for a change in instrument screen size, whilst an assessment has found that the transition from manual to automatic instruments and changes in effective response time of automatic instruments have had a negligible impact on the data. Adjustments associated with documented site moves from in-town to out-of-town locations are predominantly negative, particularly for minimum temperature, with other adjustments showing no strong bias towards either positive or negative values. The new data set shows slightly stronger warming (0.12°C per decade in mean temperature over the 1910–2016 period) than either the previous ACORN-SAT version (0.10°C) or the unhomogenized gridded data (0.08°C), primarily due to more effective treatment of systematic moves of sites out of towns and the removal of a rounding bias in the version 1 methodology.},

abstract = {The Quantile Mapping (QM) bias correction (BC) technique was applied for the first time to address biases in the simulated precipitation over Vietnam from the Regional Climate Model (RegCM) driven by five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Global Climate Model (GCM) products. The QM process was implemented for the period 1986-2005, and subsequently applied to the mid-future period 2046–2065 under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Comparison with the original model outputs during the independent validation period shows a large bias reduction from 45{\%} to 3{\%} over Vietnam and significant improvements in representing precipitation indices (PI) after applying the QM technique. Moreover, the ensemble average of the BC products generally performed better than an individual BC member in capturing the spatial distribution of the PIs. A drier condition with a longer rainfall break, and shorter consecutive rainfall events are anticipated over Northern and Central Vietnam during their respective wet seasons in the mid-future. Furthermore, this study showed that the QM method minimally modified the future changes in PIs over most of Vietnam; thus, these corrected projections could be used in climate impacts and adaptation studies.},

abstract = {We evaluate the effects of spatial resolution on the ability of a regional climate model to reproduce observed extreme precipitation for a region in the Southwestern United States. A total of 73 National Climate Data Center observational sites spread throughout Arizona and New Mexico are compared with regional climate simulations at the spatial resolutions of 50 km and 10 km for a 31 year period from 1980 to 2010. We analyze mean, 3-hourly and 24-hourly extreme precipitation events using WRF regional model simulations driven by NCEP-2 reanalysis. The mean climatological spatial structure of precipitation in the Southwest is well represented by the 10 km resolution but missing in the coarse (50 km resolution) simulation. However, the fine grid has a larger positive bias in mean summer precipitation than the coarse-resolution grid. The large overestimation in the simulation is in part due to scale-dependent deficiencies in the Kain-Fritsch convective parameterization scheme that generate excessive precipitation and induce a slow eastward propagation of the moist convective summer systems in the high-resolution simulation. Despite this overestimation in the mean, the 10 km simulation captures individual extreme summer precipitation events better than the 50 km simulation. In winter, however, the two simulations appear to perform equally in simulating extremes.},

abstract = {Variability and change in near-surface air temperature at 17 Antarctic stations is examined using data from the SCAR READER database. We consider the relationships between temperature, and atmospheric circulation, sea ice concentration and forcing by the tropical oceans. All 17 stations have their largest inter-annual temperature variability during the winter and the annual mean temperature anomalies are dominated by winter temperatures. The large inter-annual temperature variability on the western Antarctic Peninsula has decreased over the instrumental period as sea ice has declined. Variability in the phase of the SAM exerts the greatest control of temperatures, although tropical Pacific forcing has also played a large part, along with local atmospheric circulation variability at some locations. The relationship of positive (negative) SAM and high (low) Peninsula and low (high) East Antarctic temperatures was not present before the mid-1970s. Thirteen of the 17 stations have experienced a positive trend in their annual mean temperature over the full length of their record, with the largest being at Vernadsky (formerly Faraday) (0.46° ± 0.15°C{\textperiodcentered}dec−1) on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. The deepening of the Amundsen Sea low as a result of the more positive SAM and changes in the IPO and PDO have contributed to the warming of the Peninsula. Beyond the Antarctic Peninsula there has been little significant change in temperature. The two plateau stations had a small cooling from the late 1970s to the late 1990s consistent with the SAM becoming positive, but have subsequently warmed. During spring there has been an Antarctic-wide warming, with all but one station having experienced an increase in temperature, although the only trends that were significant were at Vostok, Scott base, Vernadsky and Amundsen-Scott. In this season, much of the Peninsula/West Antarctic warming can be attributed to tropical Pacific forcing through the IPO/PDO.},

abstract = {Assessment of future water availability from the Himalayan watersheds of Indus Basin (Jhelum, Kabul and upper Indus basin---UIB) is a growing concern for safeguarding the sustainable socioeconomic wellbeing downstream. This requires, before all, robust climate change information from the present-day state-of-the-art climate models. However, the robustness of climate change projections highly depends upon the fidelity of climate modeling experiments. Hence, this study assesses the fidelity of seven dynamically refined (0.44 {\$}{\$}{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$circ {\}}{\$}{\$} ∘ ) experiments, performed under the framework of the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment for South Asia (CX-SA), and additionally, their six coarse-resolution driving datasets participating in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5). We assess fidelity in terms of reproducibility of the observed climatology of temperature and precipitation, and the seasonality of the latter for the historical period (1971--2005). Based on the model fidelity results, we further assess the robustness or uncertainty of the far future climate (2061--2095), as projected under the extreme-end warming scenario of the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. Our results show that the CX-SA and their driving CMIP5 experiments consistently feature low fidelity in terms of the chosen skill metrics, suggesting substantial cold (6--10 {\$}{\$}{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$circ {\}}{\$}{\$} ∘ C) and wet (up to 80{\%}) biases and underestimation of observed precipitation seasonality. Surprisingly, the CX-SA are unable to outperform their driving datasets. Further, the biases of CX-SA and of their driving CMIP5 datasets are higher in magnitude than their projected changes under RCP8.5---and hence under less extreme RCPs---by the end of 21st century, indicating uncertain future climates for the Indus Basin watersheds. Higher inter-dataset disagreements of both CMIP5 and CX-SA for their simulated historical precipitation and for its projected changes reinforce uncertain future wet/dry conditions whereas the CMIP5 projected warming is less robust owing to higher historical period uncertainty. Interestingly, a better agreement among those CX-SA experiments that have been obtained through downscaling different CMIP5 experiments with the same regional climate model (RCM) indicates the RCMs' ability of modulating the influence of lateral boundary conditions over a large domain. These findings, instead of suggesting the usual skill-based identification of 'reasonable' global or regional low fidelity experiments, rather emphasize on a paradigm shift towards improving their fidelity by exploiting the potential of meso-to-local scale climate models---preferably of those that can solely resolve global-to-local scale climatic processes---in terms of microphysics, resolution and explicitly resolved convections. Additionally, an extensive monitoring of the nival regime within the Himalayan watersheds will reduce the observational uncertainty, allowing for a more robust fidelity assessment of the climate modeling experiments.},

It is worth mentioning that the present study is the first of its kind to use such a large number of CMIP5 models to project future changes in Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean over SA using three different warming thresholds. The results show that CSIRO–MK3–6–0, MIROC–ESM–CHEM, CNRM–CM5, CCSM4, and MRI–CGCM3 models relatively performed better with a consistent and accurate spatiotemporal simulation of Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean over SA. In terms of projected changes, Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean show a dominating and consistent warming pattern over SA with stronger intensity in higher latitude than mid–low latitudes under 1.5 oC, 2 oC, and 3 oC warming thresholds. The northwestern (eastern) regions of SA will witness greater (least) warming in Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean under all warming thresholds in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Furthermore, the central and southern parts of SA will experience a moderate increase in Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean under all warming targets. The uneven and intensified patterns of Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean may result in temperature extremes, which would pose potential risks to the local population. Therefore, more attention should be paid on the regional and local perspectives to estimate the adverse impacts of these extremes under different global warming targets. We further suggest to project future changes in climate extremes over SA under different warming levels, which will be helpful in climate change adaptation and mitigation over the study region.},

abstract = {Given the coarse spatial resolution of General Circulation Models, finer scale projections of variables affected by local-scale processes such as precipitation are often needed to drive impacts models, for example in hydrology or ecology among other fields. This need for high-resolution data leads to apply projection techniques called downscaling. Downscaling can be performed according to two approaches: dynamical and statistical models. The latter approach is constituted by various statistical families conceptually different. If several studies have made some intercomparisons of existing downscaling models, none of them included all those families and approaches in a manner that all the models are equally considered. To this end, the present study conducts an intercomparison exercise under the EURO- and MED-CORDEX initiative hindcast framework. Six Statistical Downscaling Models (SDMs) and five Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are compared in terms of precipitation outputs. The downscaled simulations are driven by the ERAinterim reanalyses over the 1989–2008 period over a common area at 0.44° of resolution. The 11 models are evaluated according to four aspects of the precipitation: occurrence, intensity, as well as spatial and temporal properties. For each aspect, one or several indicators are computed to discriminate the models. The results indicate that marginal properties of rain occurrence and intensity are better modelled by stochastic and resampling-based SDMs, while spatial and temporal variability are better modelled by RCMs and resampling-based SDM. These general conclusions have to be considered with caution because they rely on the chosen indicators and could change when considering other specific criteria. The indicators suit specific purpose and therefore the model evaluation results depend on the end-users point of view and how they intend to use with model outputs. Nevertheless, building on previous intercomparison exercises, this study provides a consistent intercomparison framework, including both SDMs and RCMs, which is designed to be flexible, i.e., other models and indicators can easily be added. More generally, this framework provides a tool to select the downscaling model to be used according to the statistical properties of the local-scale climate data to drive properly specific impact models.},

abstract = {Establishing relationships between coupled ocean-atmospheric patterns and precipitation accumulation is important to describe and predict spatio-temporal variability on annual or seasonal scales, and also to evaluate how this variability is influenced by global warming. The objective of this study was to examine the leading modes of interannual and seasonal (summer, autumn, winter, and spring) precipitation variability in South America-Chile, and their significant relationship to seasonally aggregated gridded data and climatic indices. Applying exhaustive data quality control measures to data from 238 rain gauges with different lengths of records between 1893 and 2013, a new data set was created with the objective of obtaining reliable records for further analysis. A comprehensive analysis through empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) allowed for determination of the leading modes of annual and seasonal precipitation and their main spatial patterns for the whole country. The percentage of explained variance in the relationship between seasonally aggregated indices and the leading modes of precipitation confirmed that most of the interannual and winter precipitation variability in Chile is linked to the seasonal aggregation of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The leading modes of summer, autumn, and spring precipitation were mostly linked to seasonal aggregations of the Madden and Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO).},

abstract = {AbstractThis study introduces a new daily high-resolution land-only observational gridded dataset, called SA-OBS, for precipitation and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature covering Southeast Asia. This dataset improves upon existing observational products in terms of the number of contributing stations, in the use of an interpolation technique appropriate for daily climate observations, and in making estimates of the uncertainty of the gridded data. The dataset is delivered on a 0.25° × 0.25° and a 0.5° × 0.5° regular latitude–longitude grid for the period 1981–2014. The dataset aims to provide best estimates of grid square averages rather than point values to enable direct comparisons with regional climate models. Next to the best estimates, daily uncertainties are quantified. The underlying daily station time series are collected in cooperation between meteorological services in the region: the Southeast Asian Climate Assessment and Dataset (SACA{\&}D). Comparisons are made with station observations and...},

abstract = {Earth System Models (ESM) are key ingredients of many of the climate services that are currently being developed and delivered. However, ESMs have more applications than the provision of climate services, and similarly many climate services use more sources of information than ESMs. This discussion paper elaborates on dilemmas that are evident at the interface between ESMs and climate services, in particular: (a) purposes of the models versus service development, (b) gap between the spatial and temporal scales of the models versus the scales needed in applications, and (c) Tailoring climate model results to real-world applications. A continued and broad-minded dialogue between the ESM developers and climate services providers' communities is needed to improve both the optimal use and direction of ESM development and climate service development. We put forward considerations to improve this dialogue between the communities developing ESMs and climate services, in order to increase the mutual benefit that enhanced understanding of prospects and limitations of ESMs and climate services will bring.},

These two models are linked via the OASIS3 coupler. Experiments with the new coupled system and with the stand-alone COSMO-CLM model forced by ERA-Interim re-analysis data over the period from 1985 to 1994 for the CORDEX Europe domain are carried out. The evaluation results of the coupled system show 2-m temperature biases in the range from −2.5 to 3K. Simulated 2-m temperatures are generally colder in the coupled than in the uncoupled system, and temperature differences vary by season and space. The coupled model shows an improvement compared with the stand-alone COSMO-CLM in terms of simulating 2-m temperature. The difference in 2-m temperature between the two experiments are explained as downwind cooling by the colder North and Baltic Seas in the coupled system.},

abstract = {Abstract. This study presents a high-resolution (∼ 5.5 km) estimate of surface mass balance (SMB) over the period 1979–2014 for the Antarctic Peninsula (AP), generated by the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2.3 and a firn densification model (FDM). RACMO2.3 is used to force the FDM, which calculates processes in the snowpack, such as meltwater percolation, refreezing and runoff. We evaluate model output with 132 in situ SMB observations and discharge rates from six glacier drainage basins, and find that the model realistically simulates the strong spatial variability in precipitation, but that significant biases remain as a result of the highly complex topography of the AP. It is also clear that the observations significantly underrepresent the high-accumulation regimes, complicating a full model evaluation. The SMB map reveals large accumulation gradients, with precipitation values above 3000 mm we yr−1 in the western AP (WAP) and below 500 mm we yr−1 in the eastern AP (EAP), not resolved by coarser data sets such as ERA-Interim. The average AP ice-sheet-integrated SMB, including ice shelves (an area of 4.1 × 105 km2), is estimated at 351 Gt yr−1 with an interannual variability of 58 Gt yr−1, which is dominated by precipitation (PR) (365 ± 57 Gt yr−1). The WAP (2.4 × 105 km2) SMB (276 ± 47 Gt yr−1), where PR is large (276 ± 47 Gt yr−1), dominates over the EAP (1.7 × 105 km2) SMB (75 ± 11 Gt yr−1) and PR (84 ± 11 Gt yr−1). Total sublimation is 11 ± 2 Gt yr−1 and meltwater runoff into the ocean is 4 ± 4 Gt yr−1. There are no significant trends in any of the modelled AP SMB components, except for snowmelt that shows a significant decrease over the last 36 years (−0.36 Gt yr−2).},

abstract = {The ability of a large ensemble of regional climate models to accurately simulate heat waves at the regional scale of Europe was evaluated. Within the EURO-CORDEX project, several state-of-the art models, including non-hydrostatic meso-scale models, were run for an extended time period (20 years) at high resolution (12 km), over a large domain allowing for the first time the simultaneous representation of atmospheric phenomena over a large range of spatial scales. Eight models were run in this configuration, and thirteen models were run at a classical resolution of 50 km. The models were driven with the same boundary conditions, the ERA-Interim re-analysis, and except for one simulation, no observations were assimilated in the inner domain. Results, which are compared with daily temperature and precipitation observations (ECA{\&}D and E-OBS data sets) show that, even forced by the same re-analysis, the ensemble exhibits a large spread. A preliminary analysis of the sources of spread, using in particular simulations of the same model with different parameterizations, shows that the simulation of hot temperature is primarily sensitive to the convection and the microphysics schemes, which affect incoming energy and the Bowen ratio. Further, most models exhibit an overestimation of summertime temperature extremes in Mediterranean regions and an underestimation over Scandinavia. Even after bias removal, the simulated heat wave events were found to be too persistent, but a higher resolution reduced this deficiency. The amplitude of events as well as the variability beyond the 90th percentile threshold were found to be too strong in almost all simulations and increasing resolution did not generally improve this deficiency. Resolution increase was also shown to induce large-scale 90th percentile warming or cooling for some models, with beneficial or detrimental effects on the overall biases. Even though full causality cannot be established on the basis of this evaluation work, the drivers of such regional differences were shown to be linked to changes in precipitation due to resolution changes, affecting the energy partitioning. Finally, the inter-annual sequence of hot summers over central/southern Europe was found to be fairly well simulated in most experiments despite an overestimation of the number of hot days and of the variability. The accurate simulation of inter-annual variability for a few models is independent of the model bias. This indicates that internal variability of high summer temperatures should not play a major role in controlling inter-annual variability. Despite some improvements, especially along coastlines, the analyses conducted here did not allow us to generally conclude that a higher resolution is clearly beneficial for a correct representation of heat waves by regional climate models. Even though local-scale feedbacks should be better represented at high resolution, combinations of parameterizations have to be improved or adapted accordingly. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The use of regional projections for research and climate services is currently expanding very fast. In parallel, there has been a considerable effort in developing comprehensive ensembles of regional climate model (RCM) projections, especially for Europe, in the EURO-CORDEX community (Jacob et al., 2014, 2019), with the motivation to better characterize the quality of climate models, and in particular to partition biases and uncertainties between global climate models (GCMs) and the downscaling carried out by limited-area RCMs. Currently, EURO- CORDEX has developed a set of 55 historical and scenario projections (RCP8.5) using 8 driving GCMs and 11 RCMs. This article presents the ensemble including its design and provides an evaluation of these RCM simulations over a number of classical climate variables and extreme and impact-oriented indices for the period 1981-2010. For the main variables, the model simulations generally agree with observations and reanalyses. However, several systematic biases are found as well, with shared responsibilities among RCMs and GCMs: simulations are generally too cold, too wet and too windy. Some simulations show strong systematic biases on temperature, others on precipitation or dynamical variables. The article aims at supporting a proper use of these simulations within a climate services context.},

abstract = {Abstract This study examines the response of the tropical atmospheric and oceanic circulation to increasing greenhouse gases using a coordinated set of twenty-first-century climate model experiments performed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation decreases as the climate warms in all IPCC AR4 models, in a manner consistent with the thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and Soden. The weakening occurs preferentially in the zonally asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley) component of the tropical circulation and is shown to induce substantial changes to the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the overall circulation weakens by decreasing the frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the frequency of weak updrafts, although the robustness of this behavior across all models cannot be confirmed because of the lack of data. As the climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean resemble ?El Ni{\~{n}}o?like? conditions; however, the mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El Ni{\~{n}}o and are reproduced in both mixed layer and full ocean dynamics coupled climate models. The character of the Indian Ocean response to global warming resembles that of Indian Ocean dipole mode events. The consensus of model results presented here is also consistent with recently detected changes in sea level pressure since the mid?nineteenth century.},

abstract = {This article reviews the state-of-the-art findings on recent trends in observed atmospheric variables and their extremes in Spain. Our study screened peer-reviewed articles, published within the last decade, on recent climate variability in Spain, with a particular focus on a range of the essential atmospheric variables. The review focusses on the recent evolution of precipitation and air temperature, but also on other meteorological variables such as solar radiation, wind speed, surface humidity and evapotranspiration. While this review highlights results on changes in the mean state of climate in Spain, it also gives equal attention to findings on extreme weather events like rainstorms, heat waves and droughts. A detailed review of studies focusing on recent changes in the surface climate of Spain revealed some key findings. Studies demonstrate an overall increase of solar radiation since the 1980s. A similar behaviour was observed for surface air temperature since the 1960s, on the order of +0.3{\textordmasculine}C decade-1, with rapid warming rates during summer. Different seasonal trend patterns of wind speed were noted over Spain, with declines in winter-spring and increases in summer-autumn. A remarkable decrease (-5{\%}) in relative humidity was observed from 1961 to 2011. For precipitation, studies suggested a strong variability over both space and time, with a moderate decrease of the annual total precipitation. In accordance with changes in the mean conditions of climate, studies of extreme weather events stressed a notable warming in warm extremes, while changes in cold extremes were generally insignificant.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of this century, the regional climate models PRECIS and RegCM have been applied for downscaling of the low - resolution global reanalysis , based on observations and the outputs of global climate models, also limited in their resolution. Research has focused primarily on the validation of these models, based on their use for climate studies in the Caribbean region and the comparison of their results with observational databases. At the same time, sensitivity studies have been conducted about the dependence of the performance of the models with changes in their configuration, including domain, resolution and physical processes parameterization. The models have also been used for th e downsaling of global climate model projections in climate change studies. This paper will focus on the main results obtained in the validation of these models and in sensitivity studies, focusing mainly on their ability to describe the precipitation and temperature fields and well known regional climatic features, such as midsummer drought, the Caribbean low level jet and the occurrence of tropical cyclones. It is concluded that the obtained results allow asserting that, although biases persist in some su b regions and insufficiencies in the performance of the models, there are a series of configurations that reasonably describe the climate of the region. The multi - parameter or multi - model ensemble method is recommended to obtain future climate predictions},

The review summarizes the main results obtained on the projections of the fields of precipitation, temperature and other regional climatic features, such as the midsummer drought, the Caribbean low-level jet and tropical cyclones. The results achieved up to the present allow affirming that, in spite of the existing uncertainties, most of the projections agree in the regional warming and in the reduction of the amounts of rain in the region, as well as the increase of some extreme events.

abstract = {The climate features over Central America and the Caribbean are simulated with the regional climate model RegCM4 to analyze the performance of the model in reproducing precipitation and temperature patterns over the region. Results from RegCM4 and the driving global climate model (GCM) HadGEM2-ES (HadG) are compared against gridded observations for a period from January 1980 to December 2004 using a perturbed physics ensemble formed by four configurations of the RegCM4 using different combinations of four convection schemes run over land and ocean areas: Kain Fritsch (Kf), Emanuel (Em), Grell (Ge), and Tiedtke (Tk). The added value of RegCM4 relative to the GCM simulation is also estimated, with focus over four subregions, using several metrics calculated on the RegCM4 as well as the GCM grids. The RegCM4 downscaling, expressed by the ensemble mean ENS, adds significant details to the HadG simulation of the temperature field patterns, showing smaller biases of up to ± 1.6 °C at the RCM resolution. Regarding the spatial patterns of precipitation, the HadG has overall higher correlation values with observations than ENS. However, the regional model provides more detailed spatial distributions, decreasing the bias by more than 1 mm/day over some of the islands. It also captures extreme precipitation events that are underestimated in the HadG simulation, even after upscaling to the GCM resolution grid. Concerning the performance of the different RegCM4 convection scheme combinations, KfEm and EmEm show the highest skill values for precipitation, while for temperature TkEm and GeEm are the best performing. This highlights that no individual scheme outperforms the others in all respects, while the application of the averaged ensemble technique provides the best results.},

abstract = {The assessment of regional climate change requires the development of reference long-term retrospective meteorological datasets. This article presents an 8-km-resolution atmospheric reanalysis over France performed with the the Safran-gauge-based analysis system for the period 1958–2008. Climatological features of the Safran 50-year analysis—long-term mean values, inter-annual and seasonal variability—are first presented for all computed variables: rainfall, snowfall, mean air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed and solar and infrared radiation. The spatial patterns of precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature are compared with another spatialization method, and the temporal consistency of the reanalysis is assessed through various validation experiments with both dependent and independent data. These experiments demonstrate the overall robustness of the Safran reanalysis and the improvement of its quality with time, in connection with the sharp increase in the observation network density that occurred in the 1990s. They also show the differentiated sensitivity of variables to the number of available ground observations, with precipitation and air temperature being the more robust ones. The comparison of trends from the reanalysis with those from homogenized series finally shows that if spatial patterns are globally consistent with both approaches, care must be taken when using literal values from the reanalysis and corresponding statistical significance in climate change detection studies. The Safran 50-year atmospheric reanalysis constitutes a long-term forcing datasets for land surface schemes and thus enables the simulation of the past 50 years of water resources over France.

abstract = {In this study, 8 years of high-resolution radiosonde data at nine Antarctic stations are analysed to provide the first large-scale characterization of the fine vertical structure of the low troposphere up to 3{\&}thinsp;km altitude over the coastal margins of East Antarctica. Radiosonde data show a large spatial variability of wind, temperature and humidity profiles, with different features between stations in katabatic regions (e.g., Dumont d'Urville and Mawson stations), stations over two ice shelves (Neumayer and Halley stations) and regions with complex orography (e.g., McMurdo). At the Dumont d'Urville, Mawson and Davis stations, the yearly median wind speed profiles exhibit a clear low-level katabatic jet. During precipitation events, the low-level flow generally remains of continental origin and its speed is even reinforced due to the increase in the continent-ocean pressure gradient. Meanwhile, the relative humidity profiles show a dry low troposphere, suggesting the occurrence of low-level sublimation of precipitation in katabatic regions but such a phenomenon does not appreciably occur over the ice shelves near Halley and Neumayer. Although ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalyses assimilate radiosoundings at most stations considered here, substantial - and sometimes large - low-level wind and humidity biases are revealed but ERA5 shows overall better performance. A free simulation with the regional polar version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar WRF) (at a 35{\&}thinsp;km resolution) over the entire continent shows too-strong and too-shallow near-surface jets in katabatic regions especially in winter. This may be a consequence of an underestimated coastal cold air bump and associated sea-continent pressure gradient force due to the coarse 35{\&}thinsp;km resolution of the Polar WRF simulation. Beyond documenting the vertical structure of the low troposphere over coastal East Antarctica, this study gives insights into the reliability and accuracy of two major reanalysis products in this region on the Earth. The paper further underlines the difficulty of modeling the low-level flow over the margins of the ice sheet with a state-of-the-art atmospheric model.},

abstract = {Observations evidence extremely stable boundary layers (SBL) over the Antarctic Plateau and sharp regime transitions between weakly and very stable conditions. Representing such features is a challenge for climate models. This study assesses the modeling of the dynamics of the boundary layer over the Antarctic Plateau in the LMDZ general circulation model. It uses 1 year simulations with a stretched-grid over Dome C. The model is nudged with reanalyses outside of the Dome C region such as simulations can be directly compared to in situ observations. We underline the critical role of the downward longwave radiation for modeling the surface temperature. LMDZ reasonably represents the near-surface seasonal profiles of wind and temperature but strong temperature inversions are degraded by enhanced turbulent mixing formulations. Unlike ERA-Interim reanalyses, LMDZ reproduces two SBL regimes and the regime transition, with a sudden increase in the near-surface inversion with decreasing wind speed. The sharpness of the transition depends on the stability function used for calculating the surface drag coefficient. Moreover, using a refined vertical grid leads to a better reversed “S-shaped” relationship between the inversion and the wind. Sudden warming events associated to synoptic advections of warm and moist air are also well reproduced. Near-surface supersaturation with respect to ice is not allowed in LMDZ but the impact on the SBL structure is moderate. Finally, climate simulations with the free model show that the recommended configuration leads to stronger inversions and winds over the ice-sheet. However, the near-surface wind remains underestimated over the slopes of East-Antarctica.},

abstract = {Owing to the increasing concerns about climate change due to the recent extreme rainfall events in the Philippines, long-term trends and variability in rainfall extremes in the country are investigated using 60-year (1951-2010) daily rainfall data from 35 meteorological stations. Rainfall extremes are described using seven extreme precipitation indices (EPI) that characterize daily rainfall in terms of intensity, accumulation, and duration on a seasonal perspective. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test is employed in combination with the moving blocks bootstrapping technique to detect significant trends in EPI. The results suggest a tendency toward a drying condition for the dry season, January-March (JFM), as indicated by statistically significant decreasing trends in seasonal wet days total rainfall (PCPTOT) associated with increasing trends in maximum length of dry spell (LDS). In contrast, statistically significant increasing trends in maximum 5-day rainfall (RX5day) and decreasing trends in LDS denote a wetting condition during the July-September (JAS) season, particularly at stations located in the northwest and central Philippines. The trends obtained are further assessed by examining the longer time series of EPI at four meteorological stations (Aparri, Dagupan, Iloilo, and Masbate) that have rainfall data from 1911 to 2010. The longer historical data revealed that the trends obtained in the shorter period (1951-2010) could either be consistent with the continuous long-term trends, as observed in RX5day during JAS at Aparri and Masbate, or represent interdecadal variability as was observed at Dagupan and Iloilo. The long-term (1911-2010) southwestward extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high associated with a weakening of the 850-hPa westerly wind over the South China Sea partly provides a possible cause of the trends in EPI during JAS, whereas the weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon contributed somewhat to the trends obtained during JFM. Furthermore, interannual variations in EPI are found to be influenced greatly by the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Composite analyses suggest that El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a) events are associated with statistically significant drier (wetter) conditions over the Philippines, especially during the seasons close to ENSO mature stage. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = { AbstractTrends in Canada's climate are analyzed using recently updated data to provide a comprehensive view of climate variability and long-term changes over the period of instrumental record. Trends in surface air temperature, precipitation, snow cover, and streamflow indices are examined along with the potential impact of low-frequency variability related to large-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations on these trends. The results show that temperature has increased significantly in most regions of Canada over the period 1948–2012, with the largest warming occurring in winter and spring. Precipitation has also increased, especially in the north. Changes in other climate and hydroclimatic variables, including a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow in the south, fewer days with snow cover, an earlier start of the spring high-flow season, and an increase in April streamflow, are consistent with the observed warming and precipitation trends. For the period 1900–2012, there are sufficient temperature and precipitation data for trend analysis for southern Canada (south of 60°N) only. During this period, temperature has increased significantly across the region, precipitation has increased, and the amount of precipitation falling as snow has decreased in many areas south of 55°N. The results also show that modes of low-frequency variability modulate the spatial distribution and strength of the trends; however, they alone cannot explain the observed long-term trends in these climate variables. },

The paper provides a description of each component of CNRM-CM6-1, including the coupling method and the new online output software. We emphasize where model's components have been updated with respect to the former model version, CNRM-CM5.1. In particular, we highlight major improvements in the representation of atmospheric and land processes. A particular attention has also been devoted to mass and energy conservation in the simulated climate system to limit long-term drifts. The climate simulated by CNRM-CM6-1 is then evaluated using CMIP6 historical and Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) experiments in comparison with CMIP5 CNRM-CM5.1 equivalent experiments. Overall, the mean surface biases are of similar magnitude but with different spatial patterns. Deep ocean biases are generally reduced, whereas sea ice is too thin in the Arctic. Although the simulated climate variability remains roughly consistent with CNRM-CM5.1, its sensitivity to rising CO2 has increased: the equilibrium climate sensitivity is 4.9 K, which is now close to the upper bound of the range estimated from CMIP5 models.},

abstract = {Abstract Vertical land motions are a key element in understanding how sea levels have changed over the past century and how future sea levels may impact coastal areas. Ideally, to be useful in long-term sea level studies, vertical land motion should be determined with standard errors that are 1 order of magnitude lower than the contemporary climate signals of 1 to 3 mm/yr observed on average in sea level records, either using tide gauges or satellites. This metrological requirement constitutes a challenge in geodesy. Here we review the most successful instrumental methods that have been used to determine vertical displacements at the Earth's surface, so that the objectives of understanding and anticipating sea levels can be addressed adequately in terms of accuracy. In this respect, the required level of uncertainty is examined in two case studies (global and local). A special focus is given to the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and to the combination of satellite radar altimetry with tide gauge data. We update previous data analyses and assess the quality of global satellite altimetry products available to the users for coastal applications. Despite recent advances, a near-plateau level of accuracy has been reached. The major limitation is the realization of the terrestrial reference frame, whose physical parameters, the origin and the scale factor, are beyond the scope of a unique technique such as the GPS. Additional practical but nonetheless important issues are associated with the installation of GPS antennas, such as ensuring that there is no unknown differential vertical motion with the tide gauge.},

abstract = {An observed decline in the Eastern African Long Rains from the 1980s to late 2000s appears contrary to the projected increase under future climate change. This “Eastern African climate paradox” confounds use of climate projections for adaptation planning across Eastern Africa. Here we show the decline corresponds to a later onset and earlier cessation of the long rains, with a similar seasonal maximum in area-averaged daily rainfall. Previous studies have explored the role of remote teleconnections, but those mechanisms do not sufficiently explain the decline or the newly identified change in seasonality. Using a large ensemble of observations, reanalyses and atmospheric simulations, we propose a regional mechanism that explains both the observed decline and the recent partial recovery. A decrease in surface pressure over Arabia and warmer north Arabian Sea is associated with enhanced southerlies and an earlier cessation of the long rains. This is supported by a similar signal in surface pressure in many atmosphere-only models giving lower May rainfall and an earlier cessation. Anomalously warm seas south of Eastern Africa delay the northward movement of the tropical rain-band, giving a later onset. These results are key in understanding the paradox. It is now a priority to establish the balance of mechanisms that have led to these trends, which are partially captured in atmosphere-only simulations.},

abstract = {In this study, the East Asian summer climate changes under the 1.5 °C global warming (1.5 GW) target in 30 simulations derived from 15 coupled models within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Program phase 5 (CMIP5) are examined. Compared with the current summer climate (1975–2005), both surface air temperature and precipitation increase significantly over the East Asian continent during the 1.5 GW period (average period 2021–2051). In northeastern China this is particularly pronounced with regional averaged precipitation increases of more than 7.2{\%}, which is greater than that for the whole East Asian continent (approximately 4.2{\%}). Due to stronger enhancement of precipitation north of 40°N, the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of summer precipitation over the East Asian continent changes from tripolar-like mode to dipole mode. As there is stronger surface warming over the East Asian continent than that over surrounding ocean, the land–sea thermal contrast is enhanced during the 1.5 GW period. As a result, the monsoon circulation in the lower troposphere is significantly strengthened, which causes the increased summer precipitation over the East Asian continent. In addition, larger interannual variabilities of East Asian summer monsoon circulation and associated precipitation are also suggested for the 1.5 GW period.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Small Island Developing States in the tropical western Pacific are among the most vulnerable to climate change. While a great deal of information on the observed climate change trends and their cause is available for many other regions and for the globe as a whole, much less information has been available specifically for the Pacific. Here, we show that warming over the past 50 years in the western Pacific is evident in recently homogenized tropical station data, and in gridded surface temperature data sets for the region. The warming has already emerged from the background climate variability. The observational data and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate model output are used to show that the observed warming was primarily caused by human-forced changes to the earth's radiative balance. Further warming is projected to occur in the same models under all three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) considered (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), with the magnitude far exceeding the warming to date under the two scenarios with higher emissions (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).},

We evaluate WRF model performance for a historical simulation and future projections, applying the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) as initial and boundary conditions with and without a bias correction. WRF simulations using boundary and initial conditions from both versions of CCSM4 show smaller biases versus evaluation data sets than does CCSM4 over western North America. WRF simulations also improve spatial details of precipitation over much of North America. However, driving the WRF with the bias-corrected CCSM4 does not always reduce the bias. WRF-projected changes in precipitation include decreasing intensity over the southwestern United States, increasing intensity over the eastern United Sates and most of Canada, and an increase in the number of days with heavy precipitation over much of North America. Projected precipitation changes are more evident in the late 21st century than the mid 21st century, and they are more evident under RCP 8.5 than under RCP 4.5 in the late 21st century. Uncertainties in the projected changes in precipitation due to different warming scenarios are non-negligible. Differences in summer precipitation changes between WRF and CCSM4 are significant over most of the United States.},

abstract = {This article documents how Environment and Climate Change Canada's Adjusted Daily Rainfall and Snowfall (AdjDlyRS) dataset was developed. The adjustments include (i) conversion of ruler measurements of snowfall to its water equivalent using a previously developed snow water equivalent (SWE) ratio map for Canada; (ii) corrections for gauge-related issues including undercatch and evaporation caused by wind effects and gauge-specific wetting loss, as well as for trace precipitation amounts, using previously developed procedures for Canada. Various data flags (e.g., accumulation flags) were also treated. This dataset contains all Canadian stations reporting daily rainfall and snowfall for which we have metadata to implement the adjustments. The length of the data record varies from one station to another, starting as early as 1840. The results show that the original unadjusted total precipitation data in Environment and Climate Change Canada's digital archive underestimate the total precipitation in northeastern Canada by more than 25{\%} and by about 10–15{\%} in most of southern Canada. Such large underestimates make the original data unsuitable for water availability and/or balance studies or for numerical model validation, among many other applications. The use of the assumed 10:1 SWE ratio for the archived total precipitation data is the primary cause of the underestimate, which is most severe in northeastern Canada. The trace correction adds 5–20{\%} to precipitation values in northern Canada but less than 5{\%} in southern Canada. The gauge-related corrections do not show an organized spatial pattern but add 5–10{\%} to the precipitation at 312 stations. Long runs (≥3 months) of miscoded missing values were also identified and corrected. The latest version of the AdjDlyRS dataset is available from the Canadian Open Data Portal; currently it is version 2016, which contains 3346 stations and covers the period from station inception to February 2016. This dataset is suitable for producing gridded precipitation datasets, as well as other applications.},

abstract = {Based on several reanalysis and observational datasets, this study demonstrates that the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) recovered from its weak epoch and re-amplified in the mid-2000s. Accordingly, East Asia has experienced more cold winters and significant negative surface air temperature anomalies during the recent strong EAWM epoch spanning the period 2004--2012. The associated cooling was mainly located over inland northern East Asia with a west--east orientation. The cooling generally coincided with negative winter temperature trends in eastern Eurasia in the last two decades, possibly contributing to the observed regional cooling trend when the global mean temperature is still trending up. Enhanced wintertime blocking activity around the Ural mountain region and diminished Arctic sea ice concentration in the previous September are suggested to be the responsible internal atmospheric process and external driver for the recent re-amplification of the EAWM, respectively.},

On the interannual time scale, the EAWM variability features two major modes: the strength and pathway of the EAWM, which are linked to the changes in the amplitude and phase of atmospheric planetary waves, respectively. The blocking activity over Ural and Pacific regions exert significant impacts on the strength of the EAWM in the form of Eurasian and Western Pacific patterns. The former also contributes largely to the recent decadal amplification of the EAWM. El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Arctic sea ice are important external forcing for the EAWM variability, while the impacts of ENSO on the EAWM vary with decades. On the intraseasonal time scale, the Siberian high shows clear out-of-phase relationship between early and peak winter in recent thirty years. Both the stratospheric variability and the Madden-Julian Oscillation could influence the characteristics of cold surges over East Asia.

abstract = {Stake measurements at 2 km intervals are used to determine the spatial and temporal surface mass balance (SMB) in recent decades along the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition traverse route from Syowa Station to Dome F. To determine SMB variability at regional scales, this traverse route is divided into four regions, i.e., coastal, lower katabatic, upper katabatic and inland plateau. We also perform a regional evaluation of large scale SMB simulated by the regional atmospheric climate model versions 2.1 and 2.3 (RACMO2.1 and RACMO2.3), and the four more recent global reanalyses. Large-scale spatial variability in the multi-year averaged SMB reveals robust relationships with continentality and surface elevation. In the katabatic regions, SMB variability is also highly associated with surface slope, which in turn is affected by bedrock topography. Stake observation records show large inter-annual variability in SMB, but did not indicate any significant trends over both the last 40 years for the coastal and lower katabatic regions, and the last 20 years record for the upper katabatic and inland plateau regions. The four reanalyses and the regional climate model reproduce the macro-scale spatial pattern well for the multi-year averaged SMB, but fail to capture the mesoscale SMB increase at the distance interval {\~{}}300 to {\~{}}400 km from Syowa station. Thanks to the updated scheme in the cloud microphysics, RACMO2.3 shows the best spatial agreement with stake measurements over the inland plateau region. ERA-interim, JRA-55 and MERRA exhibit high agreement with the inter-annual variability of observed SMB in the coastal, upper katabatic and inland plateau regions, and moderate agreement in the lower katabatic region, while NCEP2 and RACMO2.1 inter-annual variability shows no significant correlation with the observations for the inland plateau region.},

abstract = {Recently, a hot topic about warmer and wetter climate change in the arid region of Northwest China, especially in Xinjiang, has attracted much attention by general public and scientific community. This study revisits this topic especially for Xinjiang in the Eurasian continental context from multiple perspectives based on most updated CRU high-resolution grid data and China's homogenized station data in 1961–2019. We conclude that such ‘warming–wetting' trend is not a regional phenomenon for Xinjiang but has much larger spatial scale. Regions having experienced both temperature and precipitation increases reflecting ‘warming–wetting' trend account for more than half of the Eurasian continent since 1961. Nevertheless, the ‘warming–wetting' trend in Xinjiang suggests some unique regional features in response to the global warming. Although drought seems to have relieved to some extent, especially in the mountainous regions in western Xinjiang, the nature of arid and semi-arid climate regime has not changed. Noticeably, the interannual variability of precipitation has enlarged and the increase in extreme precipitation events has a major contribution. These findings suggest that ‘warming–wetting' trend in Xinjiang is asymmetric regarding warming and wetting in seasons and intensifying interannual variability and increasing contribution of extreme precipitation to the total. Thus, the current ‘warming–wetting' trend in Xinjiang possibly brings us some beneficial impacts for the ecosystem but also increases challenges for water resources utilization and risk management.},

The methodology is an analog of the fingerprinting method adapted to extremes using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The signals are estimated as the time-dependent location parameters of GEV distributions fitted to extremes simulated by multimodel ensembles under anthropogenic (ANT), natural (NAT), or combined anthropogenic and natural (ALL) external forcings. The observed extremes are modeled by GEV distributions whose location parameters incorporate the signals as covariates. A coordinate descent algorithm improves both computational efficiency and accuracy in comparison to the existing method, facilitating detection of multiple signals simultaneously. An overall goodness-of-fit test was performed at the regional level. The ANT signal was separated from the NAT signal in four to six regions. In these analyses, the waiting times of the 1951–55 20-yr return level in the 2006–10 climate for the temperature of the coldest night and day were found to have increased to over 20 yr; the corresponding waiting times for the warmest night and day were found to have dropped below 20 yr in a majority of the regions.},

Most models, however, have deficiencies and biases that raise large uncertainties in their products. Over the past several decades, a tremendous eort has been made to improve model performance in the simulation of special regions and aspects of the climate system2–4. Herewe showthat biases or errors in special regions can be linked with others at far away locations.We find in 22 climate models that regional sea surface temperature (SST) biases are commonly linked with the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which is characterized by the northward flow in the upper ocean and returning southward flow in the deep ocean. A simulated weak AMOC is associated with cold biases in the entire Northern Hemisphere with an atmospheric pattern that resembles the Northern Hemisphere annular mode. The AMOC weakening is also associated with a strengthening of Antarctic BottomWater formation and warm SST biases in the Southern Ocean. It is also shown that cold biases in the tropical North Atlantic and West African/Indian monsoon regions during the warm season in the Northern Hemisphere have interhemispheric links withwarm SST biases in the tropical southeastern Pacific and Atlantic, respectively. The results suggest that improving the simulation of regional processes may not suce for overall better model performance, as the eects of remote biases may override them.},

abstract = {Climate modeling groups from four continents have submitted simulations as part of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). With climate impact assessment in mind, we test the accuracy of the seasonal averages of temperature, precipitation, and mean sea level pressure, compared to two observational datasets. Nondimensional skill scores have been generated for the global land and six continental domains. For most cases the 25 models analyzed perform well, particularly the models from Europe. Overall, this CMIP5 ensemble shows improved skill over the earlier (ca. 2005) CMIP3 ensemble of 24 models. This improvement is seen for each variable and continent, and in each case it is largely consistent with the increased resolution on average of CMIP5, given the correlation between scores and grid length found across the combined ensemble. From this apparent influence on skill, the smaller average score for the 13 Earth system models in CMIP5 is consistent with their mostly lower resolution. T...},

abstract = {Based on observed daily precipitation data, this study investigates the changes in the characteristics of precipitation over northern Eurasia during 1951–2010. Over the majority of northern Eurasia (east of 20° E), the light precipitation days and amounts decrease, but those for the moderate, heavy, and very heavy precipitation increase. Moreover, the precipitation intensity increases, which is responsible for the decrease in light precipitation days and amount and increase in relatively more intense precipitation since there is no significant trend in total precipitation days. However, the precipitation characteristics are opposite over the Iberian Peninsula. We find that the changes in precipitation characteristics are possibly due to the changes in static stability. In the majority region (the Iberian Peninsula), the static stability weakens (strengthens) during 1951–2010. When static stability weakens (strengths), the upward motion increases (decreases) and thus the precipitation intensity increases (decreases). Accordingly, the light precipitation events decrease (increase) and heavy precipitation events increase (decrease).},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A new high-quality daily and monthly temperature station dataset was prepared for the tropical Western Pacific through a quality control and homogenization process. The homogeneity of 46 temperature stations, collected at a workshop conducted as part of the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning program, was assessed and the non-climatic step changes were removed. Here we present trends in mean and extreme temperature for the Western Pacific, covering an extended time period and larger geographical area compared with previous analyses. We discuss five main conclusions: (1) There is a significant warming trend in annual mean temperature over the past 50 years (1961–2011), of between 0.05 and 0.34 °C per decade. (2) Significant and spatially homogeneous warming trends are evident at the station level over 1961–2011 for the warm and cool extremes of both maximum and minimum temperatures. (3) Sub-regional trends, over the period 1951–2011, are spatially coherent, with the largest warming trends in the hottest day and night of the year and the coolest night of the year. (4) This analysis highlights the role of decadal variability in the number of days exceeding extreme temperature thresholds, with the upper (lower) tails of the distribution warming more (less) in recent decades. (5) We show that strong relationships exist between local and remote sea-surface temperature anomalies and all indices of extreme temperature, particularly with minimum temperature extremes.},

abstract = {The relationship between winter precipitation in North America and indices of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is evaluated using non-stationary generalized extreme value distributions with the indices as covariates. Both covariates have a statistically significant influence on precipitation that is well simulated by two regional climate models (RCMs), CanRCM4 and CRCM5. The observed influence of the NAO on extreme precipitation is largest in eastern North America, with the likelihood of a negative phase extreme rainfall event decreased in the north and increased in the south under the positive phase of the NAO. This pattern is generally well simulated by the RCMs although there are some differences in the extent of influence, particularly south of the Great Lakes. A La Ni{\~{n}}a-magnitude extreme event is more likely to occur under El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions in California and the southern United States, and less likely in most of Canada and a region south of the Great Lakes. This broad pattern is also simulated well by the RCMs but they do not capture the increased likelihood in California. In some places the extreme precipitation response in the RCMs to external forcing from a covariate is of the opposite sign, despite use of the same lateral boundary conditions and dynamical core. This demonstrates the importance of model physics for teleconnections to extreme precipitation.},

abstract = {A key challenge for climate projection science is to serve the rapidly growing needs of impact and adaptation assessments (hereafter risk assessments) in an environment where there are substantial differences in the regional projections of climate models, an expanding number of potentially relevant climate model results, and a desire amongst many users to limit the number of future climate scenarios in their assessments. While it may be attractive to select a small number of climate models based on their ability to replicate current climate, there is no robust method for doing this. We outline and illustrate a method that addresses this challenge in a different way. The range of plausible future climates simulated by climate models is classified into a small set of Representative Climate Futures (RCFs) and the relative likelihood of these estimated. For each region, the RCFs are then used as a framework in which to classify more detailed information, such as available climate model and downscaled data sets. Researchers wishing to apply the RCFs in risk assessments can then choose to use a subset of RCFs, such as the "most likely", "high risk" and "least change" cases for their impact system. Preparation and analysis of future climate data sets can therefore be confined to those models whose simulations best represent the selected RCFs. This significantly reduces the number of models involved, and potentially the effort required to undertake the risk assessment. Consistently applied within a region, RCFs, rather than individual climate models, can become the boundary objects which anchor discussion between the climate science and risk assessment communities, simplifying communication. Since the RCF descriptions need not change as new climate model results emerge, they can also provide a stable framework for assimilating risk assessments undertaken at different times with different sets of climate models. Systematic application of this approach requires various challenges to be addressed, such as robustly classifying future regional climates into a small set and estimating likelihoods. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

These were prepared by CSIRO up to 2001, and by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology from 2007 onward. A range of scientific and communication issues were addressed in preparing each statement, including decisions concerning climate model ensembles, emission scenarios, forming ranges of change, use of probability, use of expert judgment, spatial resolution, presentation methods and representing uncertainties. There are a number of perennial issues, trends and tensions, which may be of interest to future production of regional projections for Australia and other regions. For example, managing and communicating uncertainty in future climate due to differing emissions and model responses has been a perennial element of the projections. There has been a trend towards wider scope in variables analysed, time periods discussed and use of peer review, as well as greater content in the statements over time, partly reflecting available modelling results and the increasing range, needs and sophistication of users. There are several notable tensions in this work, reflected in some approaches being adopted and then dropped in subsequent statements. Examples include the choice of spatial resolution, the use of probability, model evaluation and expert judgement. These tensions reflect the difficulty in striking the right balance between competing scientific considerations or between scientific credibility and saliency for users.},

This study identifies a key mode of jet variability and demonstrates how it is strongly coupled with rainfall. The approach provides a quantitative framework to assess jet–rainfall coupling and a useful tool to investigate the concerning spread in CMIP5 rainfall projections over the West African Sahel. It is shown that many CMIP5 simulations fail to capture this coupling, indicating a fundamental limitation in their ability to predict future rainfall conditions. The results demonstrate that West African rainfall in the coming CMIP6 ensemble should be interpreted with caution; key atmospheric processes that deliver rainfall must be validated before conducting detailed analysis on rainfall.},

abstract = {Abstract The Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ) is shown to be a real and dominant climatological feature of the early summer Caribbean climate. It manifests as an intensification in the trade winds in the western Caribbean basin (70°W–80°W) with an east-west axis along 15°N. It is confined to heights below 600 mb and has maximum wind speeds approaching 16 m/s near the surface. The study shows that there is variability in the strength and zonal extent of the CLLJ which can be related to zonal SST gradients between the eastern equatorial Pacific and the north tropical and/or equatorial Atlantic. When the gradient is driven by the Pacific (as in an EL Ni{\~{n}}o event) the CLLJ winds are intensified to the north and in its southwesternmost quadrant. When the winds are driven by the tropical north Atlantic there is uniform wind intensification about the jet axis. The CLLJ is also linked to a precipitation maximum over the near waters and along the Caribbean coast of Central America (up to 16°N) during June and more so, in July. There is evidence of variation at the northern extent of this wet zone depending on the ocean basin forcing the SST gradient. The CLLJ is also linked to moderate drying in the main Caribbean basin.

abstract = {Recent major melting events in West Antarctica have raised concerns about a potential hydrofracturing and ice shelf instability. These events often share common forcings of surface melt-like anomalous radiative fluxes, turbulent heat fluxes and f{\"{o}}hn winds. Using an atmospheric river detection algorithm developed for Antarctica together with surface melt datasets, we produced a climatology of atmospheric river-related surface melting around Antarctica and show that atmospheric rivers are associated with a large percentage of these surface melt events. Despite their rarity (around 12 events per year in West Antarctica), atmospheric rivers are associated with around 40{\%} of the total summer meltwater generated across the Ross Ice Shelf to nearly 100{\%} in the higher elevation Marie Byrd Land and 40–80{\%} of the total winter meltwater generated on the Wilkins, Bach, George IV and Larsen B and C ice shelves. These events were all related to high-pressure blocking ridges that directed anomalous poleward moisture transport towards the continent. Major melt events in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet only occur about a couple times per decade, but a 1–2 °C warming and continued increase in atmospheric river activity could increase the melt frequency with consequences for ice shelf stability.},

abstract = {Observations and simulations link anthropogenic greenhouse and aerosol emissions with rapidly increasing Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Over the past 60 years, the Indian Ocean warmed two to three times faster than the central tropical Pacific, extending the tropical warm pool to the west by {\~{}}40° longitude ({\textgreater}4,000 km). This propensity toward rapid warming in the Indian Ocean has been the dominant mode of interannual variability among SSTs throughout the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans (55°E–140°W) since at least 1948, explaining more variance than anomalies associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the atmosphere, the primary mode of variability has been a corresponding trend toward greatly increased convection and precipitation over the tropical Indian Ocean. The temperature and rainfall increases in this region have produced a westward extension of the western, ascending branch of the atmospheric Walker circulation. Diabatic heating due to increased mid-tropospheric water vapor condensation elicits a westward atmospheric response that sends an easterly flow of dry air aloft toward eastern Africa. In recent decades (1980–2009), this response has suppressed convection over tropical eastern Africa, decreasing precipitation during the ‘long-rains' season of March–June. This trend toward drought contrasts with projections of increased rainfall in eastern Africa and more ‘El Ni{\~{n}}o-like' conditions globally by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Increased Indian Ocean SSTs appear likely to continue to strongly modulate the Warm Pool circulation, reducing precipitation in eastern Africa, regardless of whether the projected trend in ENSO is realized. These results have important food security implications, informing agricultural development, environmental conservation, and water resource planning.},

A control simulation with observed ice cover is compared with three sensitivity tests: complete ice cover, no lake ice, and warmer lake surface temperatures. The spatial pattern of unfrozen lake surfaces determines the placement of LES, and complete ice cover eliminates it. Removal of ice cover and an increase in lake temperatures result in an expansion of the LES area both along and downwind of the lake shore, as well as an increase in snowfall amount. While lake temperatures and phase determine the amount and spatial coverage of LES, the finescale distribution of LES is strongly affected by the interaction between lake surface fluxes, the large-scale flow, and the local lake shore geography and inland topography. As a consequence, the sensitivity of LES to topography and shore geometry differs for lakes with short versus long overwater fetch. These simulations indicate that coarse-resolution models may be able to realistically reproduce the gross features of LES in future climates, but will miss the important local-scale interactions that determine the location and intensity of LES.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Inevitable drawbacks occur when the Asian monsoon is simulated at a horizontal resolution that is too low to resolve topographic effects and sub-grid processes. By comparing the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 5 simulations conducted at higher (∼1°) and lower (∼3°) horizontal resolutions, this study attempted to extend understanding of potential resolution limits in simulating the East Asian presummer climate. April–May is found to have considerable resolution-dependent contrasts in position and strength of precipitation (spring rains and pre–Meiyu) among the simulations. The low-resolution models cannot simulate ascending vertical motion over the mountainous regions in the southern Tibetan Plateau and subtropical East Asia, which coincides with the overestimation of the strength of the lower-tropospheric westerly in 90°–105°E and of the downstream southerly in 110°–130°E. Because of the southerly wind bias, the East Asian presummer precipitation simulated in the low-resolution models is lower in amount and located farther north compared with the observed and high-resolution models. Despite distinct large-scale climatology between April and late May, the East Asian precipitation contrasts in these two periods are similar between the high- and low-resolution models, which could be possibly explained as a systematic response to resolution. Systematically less precipitation in the high-resolution model compared with the low-resolution model is also observable over the Maritime Continent, whereas a further connection to the East Asian precipitation simulation remains unclear. Regarding projected changes, the resolution-dependent contrasts are also considerable; the contrasts further suggest potential regional interactions such as between the subtropical South and East Asia (10°–20°N).},

The set consists of 4 simulations by the RCM of RegCM4 driven by 4 different GCMs for the period of 1979–2099 under the mid-range RCP4.5 (representative concentration pathway) scenario. Results show that for present day conditions, the RCM provides with more spatial details of the distribution and in general reduces the biases of GCM, in particular in DJF (December–January–February) and over areas with complex topography. Bias patterns show some correlation between the RCM and driving GCM in DJF but not in JJA (June–July–August). In JJA, the biases in RCM simulations show similar pattern and low sensitivity to the driving GCM, which can be attributed to the large effect of internal model physics in the season. For change signals, dominant forcings from the driving GCM are evident in the RCM simulations as shown by the magnitude, large scale spatial distribution, as well as interannual variation of the changes. The added value of RCM projection is characterized by the finer spatial detail in sub-regional (river basins) and local scale. In DJF, profound warming over the Tibetan Plateau is simulated by RCM but not GCMs. In general no clear relationships are found between the model bias and change signal, either for the driving GCMs or nested RCM.},

abstract = {Abstract From 1961 to 2015, annual and seasonal precipitation have shown a significant increase over Northwest China (NW). The change of precipitation is a combination result of the changing recycling precipitation (Pw) contributed by local evapotranspiration (ET) and changing precipitation contributed by advection moisture (Po). In this paper, we calculated the ET based on the observation data of meteorological stations and the complementary relationship model. Then used an improved precipitation recycling model to analyse influential factors on the variation of precipitation over the NW from aspects of ET and advection moisture. The annual precipitation recycling ratio ($\rho$) fluctuates between 4$\backslash${\%} and 10$\backslash${\%} and shows an increasing trend at a rate of 0.3$\backslash${\%} /10a with a significance level of 0.01. ET, which is the internal supplier of the precipitable water, and advection moisture, which is the outside supplier of the precipitable water, both have displayed significantly increasing trends over the NW. The advection moisture contributes precipitation much more than ET, no matter in the annual scale or seasonal scales. In view of the spatial distribution, Pw shows an increasing trend over the whole NW, but distinctly opposite spatial patterns of Po are found between the western area of NW (WNW) and the eastern area of NW (ENW). Such differences caused the precipitation is characterized by a wetting trend in WNW but a drying trend in ENW.},

abstract = {The rate of warming of the Arctic surface temperature has exceeded that of the global surface temperature in recent decades. However, the underlying process and causes of the long-term warming remain uncertain. In this paper, we explored the factors underlying variation in Arctic mean surface temperature anomalies (AMTA) using a piecewise linear model for 1920–2018. This analysis indicated that the change in AMTA during the study period could be divided into three segments, with AMTA increasing from 1920 to 1938, declining from 1939 to 1976, and finally increasing rapidly after 1977. By a newly developed rigorous formalism of information flow, we found a one-way causality from the driving forces to AMTA. Moreover, the AMTA evolution could mainly be attributed to a combined effect of anthropogenic and natural factors (e.g., CO2, aerosol, and PDO). During the first warming stage (1920–1938), the PDO and aerosols are the main factors determining the change in AMTA. During the second warming stage (1977–2018), greenhouse gases, dominated by CO2, are the major factors accounting for the Arctic warming. In 1939–1976, the observed cooling may be associated with aerosols, clouds, and land use. A better understanding of the driving mechanism underlying AMTA evolution provides insight into the historical Arctic climate change, and can improve the prediction of future changes in AMTA.},

abstract = {The surface air temperature (SAT) trends from historical simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were compared with observations for the period of 1955–2004. The observed spatial pattern of SAT trends was strikingly different from the CMIP5-historical simulations over mid- and high-latitude Northern Hemisphere. The strongest observed warming for the Eurasian Continent was over mid latitudes. However, the CMIP5 historical simulations indicated enhanced warming over higher latitudes, and the warming trends increased from low to higher latitudes. The zonal mean SAT trends indicated overestimated warming in high-latitude and underestimated warming in mid-latitude land over Northern Hemisphere in CMIP5 historical simulations, which resulted in opposite trends in the meridional temperature gradient over high latitudes compared with observations. The overestimated Arctic and underestimated Eurasia mid-latitude warming only occurred in cold season. Further comparison of the results of CMIP5 models from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project and historical simulations revealed that model bias in sea surface temperature and the exaggerated response of temperature change to Arctic sea ice decline are possible reasons for poorly simulated Arctic and Eurasia mid-latitude temperature change.},

abstract = {Based on the data of five observed meteorological elements (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, sunshine duration, and relative humidity) from 22 stations, the paper investigated the climate variations in northern Xinjiang over the past 50 years. The analytical results showed that both the temperature and the precipitation have increased significantly (0.35°C/10y, 11.2mm/10y) during the period of 1960–2011. An abrupt change was detected to have occurred in 1986 for temperature and in 1987 for precipitation. Autumn was the season when the temperature increased most dramatically, and winter and autumn were the seasons when the precipitation increased most dramatically. The twenty years after 1990 were the warmest and wettest two decades of the past ∼50 years, but the warming and wetting paces have slowed down during the same period. The results also showed that the mean annual minimum temperature increased more dramatically than the mean annual maximum temperature, resulting in a greatly reduced diurnal range. The reasons or mechanisms for rising trend of temperature during the past 50 years and also for the faster rising rate of the temperature in northern Xinjiang and the adjacent areas have been reasonably explored in published literature. However, the reasons or mechanisms for the rising trend of the past 50-year precipitation in northern Xinjiang and the adjacent areas have not been reasonably explored. This wetting trend has not extended further to the surrounding areas including Republic of Mongolia, major part of North China, and five republics of the former Soviet Union, and the need is thus pressing to explore the reasons or mechanisms behind this relatively “localized” wetting trend.},

abstract = {The simulation of snow water equivalent (SWE) remains difficult for regional climate models. Accurate SWE simulation depends on complex interacting climate processes such as the intensity and distribution of precipitation, rain-snow partitioning, and radiative fluxes. To identify the driving forces behind SWE difference between model and reanalysis datasets, and guide model improvement, we design a framework to quantitatively decompose the SWE difference contributed from precipitation distribution and magnitude, ablation, temperature and topography biases in regional climate models. We apply this framework within the California Sierra Nevada to four regional climate models from the North American Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX) run at three spatial resolutions. Models generally predict less SWE compared to Landsat-Era Sierra Nevada Snow Reanalysis (SNSR) dataset. Unresolved topography associated with model resolution contribute to dry and warm biases in models. Refining resolution from 0.44° to 0.11° improves SWE simulation by 35{\%}. To varying degrees across models, additional difference arises from spatial and elevational distribution of precipitation, cold biases revealed by topographic correction, uncertainties in the rain-snow partitioning threshold, and high ablation biases. This work reveals both positive and negative contributions to snow bias in climate models and provides guidance for future model development to enhance SWE simulation.},

abstract = {As abundant distribution of glaciers and snow, the Tianshan Mountains are highly vulnerable to changes in climate. Based on meteorological station records during 1960–2016, we detected the variations of air temperature and precipitation by using non-parametric method in the different sub-regions and different elevations of the Tianshan Mountains. The mutations of climate were investigated by Mann-Kendall abrupt change test in the sub-regions. The periodicity is examined by wavelet analysis employing a chi-square test and detecting significant time sections. The results show that the Tianshan Mountains experienced an overall rapid warming and wetting during study period, with average warming rate of 0.32°C/10a and wet rate of 5.82mm/10a, respectively. The annual and seasonal spatial variation of temperature showed different scales in different regions. The annual precipitation showed non-significant upward trend in 20 stations, and 6 stations showed a significant upward trend. The temperatures in the East Tianshan increased most rapidly at rates of 0.41°C/10a. The increasing magnitudes of annual precipitation were highest in the Boertala Vally (8.07mm/10a) and lowest in the East Tianshan (2.64mm/10a). The greatest and weakest warming was below 500m (0.42°C/10a) and elevation of 1000–1500m (0.23°C/10a), respectively. The increasing magnitudes of annual precipitation were highest in the elevation of 1500m–2000m (9.22mm/10a) and lowest in the elevation of below 500m (3.45mm/10a). The mutations of annual air temperature and precipitation occurred in 1995 and 1990, respectively. The large atmospheric circulation influenced on the mutations of climate. The significant periods of air temperature were 2.4–4.1years, and annual precipitation was 2.5–7.4years. Elevation dependency of temperature trend magnitude was not evidently in the Tianshan Mountains. The annual precipitation wetting trend was amplified with elevation in summer and autumn. The strong elevation dependence of precipitation increasing trend appeared in summer.},

abstract = {Global warming has already had a significant impact on social ecosystems. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is characterized by a cryosphere, is also recognized to have a profound influence on regional and global climate systems, as well as the ecological economy. Therefore, research on the cryosphere is of significant importance. This paper comprehensively reviews the current status and recent changes of the cryosphere (e.g., glacier, snow cover, and frozen ground) in the TP from the perspectives of observations and simulations. Because of enhanced climate warming in the TP, a large portion of glaciers have experienced significant retreat since the 1960s, with obvious regional differences. The retreat is the smallest in the TP interior, and gradually increases towards the edges. Glacier simulations are comparatively few and still under development. Snow cover is a highly sensitive element of the cryosphere and decreases with large interdecadal variations from the 1960s to the 2010s in general. Simulations of snow cover mostly focus on the mutual feedback between the snow cover anomaly, climate and atmospheric circulation. In situ observations and simulations both indicate that the mean annual temperature of frozen ground increases, causing permafrost thaw and degradation and decreasing the seasonal freeze depth of seasonally frozen ground. Under future climate warming, the cryospheric elements in the TP will continue to diminish on the whole. Studies of climate and the cryosphere are ongoing. To date, the lack of observations is the biggest challenge on the TP, resulting in a divergence of cryosphere dynamics and its simulation being a bottleneck. To overcome these issues, a strategy that combines sets of in situ and remote sensing measurements and improved numerical models is of great importance for achieving breakthroughs with respect to research on the TP cryosphere and its interaction with climate.},

abstract = {East Africa has two rainy seasons: the long rains [March–May (MAM)] and the short rains [October–December (OND)]. Most CMIP3/5 coupled models overestimate the short rains while underestimating the long rains. In this study, the East African rainfall bias is investigated by comparing the coupled historical simulations from CMIP5 to the corresponding SST-forced AMIP simulations. Much of the investigation is focused on the MRI-CGCM3 model, which successfully reproduces the observed rainfall annual cycle in East Africa in the AMIP experiment but its coupled historical simulation has a similar but stronger bias as the coupled multimodel mean. The historical–AMIP monthly climatology rainfall bias in East Africa can be explained by the bias in the convective instability (CI), which is dominated by the near-surface moisture static energy (MSE) and ultimately by the MSE's moisture component. The near-surface MSE bias is modulated by the sea surface temperature (SST) over the western Indian Ocean. The warm SST bias in OND can be explained by both insufficient ocean dynamical cooling and latent flux, while the insufficient shortwave radiation and excess latent heat flux mainly contribute to the cool SST bias in MAM.},

There is growing evidence that the elevation-dependent wetting (EDWE), which is the precipitation wetting trend is amplified with elevation. The precipitation trend increases significantly with elevation except for the altitude from 500 to 1500m, the highest correlation appears above 1500m, increases by 13mm/decade with each 1000m. With the elevation increasing every 1000m, precipitation tendency rate increases by 7mm/decade from 1000 to 2000m and increases by 10mm/decade from 2000 to 4000m. EDWE has an impact on the change of the cryospheric systems, ecosystems and water resources, especially in arid regions of China. We discuss mechanisms that contribute towards EDWE: water vapor changes and warming-driven water circulation speeds up. We suggest future needs to increase evidence of understand the EDWE in other mountainous regions, and its controlling mechanisms through integrated the observational network of surface in-situ climate observations, satellite data and high-resolution climatic modeling.},

In this study, the impacts of high resolution to the simulation of spatial distributions and rainfall intensity of the EASM rain belt are revealed based on Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models. A set of sensitivity experiments is further performed to eliminate the potential influences of differences among CMIP5 models. The results show that the high-resolution models improve the intensity and the spatial pattern of the EASM rainfall compared to the low-resolution models, further valid in the sensitivity experiments. The diagnosis of moist static energy (MSE) balance and moisture budgets is further performed to understand the mechanisms underlying the enhancements. Both analyses indicate that the improved EASM rainfall benefits from the intensified meridional convergence along the EASM rain belt simulated by the high-resolution models. In addition, such convergence is mainly contributed by intensified stationary meridional eddy northerly flows over the central northern areas of China and southerly flows over the south of Japan due to increased model resolution, which is robust in the sensitivity experiments. Further analysis indicates that the stationary meridional eddy flow changes in high-resolution simulations are related to the barotropic Rossby wave downstream of the Tibetan Plateau resulting from increased resolution. },

One advantage of APHRODITE-2 products (versions 1801R1 and 1901) over APHRODITE-1 products is the ability to ensure uniformity in the daily accumulation period (end of the day, EOD) used in a specific domain. To create these EOD segregated or EOD adjusted products, we applied an EOD judgment scheme using multi-satellite merged precipitation products CMORPH V1.0 and ERA-Interim reanalysis. The novelty of the current methodology was tested against rain-gauge datasets with known EOD information. Despite the difference in horizontal resolution, ERA-Interim shows similar EOD detection performance to CMORPH. However, CMORPH showed better performance over India than ERA-Interim. The current method has potential to judge EOD of rain-gauge station data with an unknown observation time.

abstract = {Convective precipitation—localized, short-lived, intense, and sometimes violent—is at the root of challenges associated with observation, simulation, and prediction of precipitation. The understanding of long-term changes in convective precipitation characteristics and their role in precipitation extremes and intensity over extratropical regions are imperative to future water resource management; however, they have been studied very little. We show that annual convective precipitation total has been increasing astonishingly fast, at a rate of 18.4{\%}/°C, of which 16{\%} is attributable to an increase in convective precipitation occurrence, and 2.4{\%} is attributable to increased daily intensity based on the 35 years of two (combined) historical data sets of 3-hourly synoptic observations and daily precipitation. We also reveal that annual daily precipitation extreme has been increasing at a rate of about 7.4{\%}/°C in convective events only. Concurrently, the overall increase in mean daily precipitation intensity is mostly due to increased convective precipitation, possibly at the expanse of nonconvective precipitation. As a result, transitional seasons are becoming more summer-like as convective becomes the dominant precipitation type that has accompanied higher daily extremes and intensity since the late 1980s. The data also demonstrate that increasing convective precipitation and daily extremes appear to be directly linearly associated with higher atmospheric water vapor accompanying a warming climate over northern Eurasia.},

abstract = {AbstractThis study uses 45 years of observational records from 517 historical surface weather stations over northern Eurasia to examine changing precipitation characteristics associated with increasing air temperatures. Results suggest that warming air temperatures over northern Eurasia have been accompanied by higher precipitation intensity but lower frequency and little change in annual precipitation total. An increase in daily precipitation intensity of around 1{\%}–3{\%} per each degree of air temperature increase is found for all seasons as long as a station's seasonal mean air temperature is below about 15°–16°C. This threshold temperature may be location dependent. At temperatures above this threshold, precipitation intensity switches to decreasing with increasing air temperature, possibly related to decreasing water vapor associated with extreme high temperatures. Furthermore, the major atmospheric circulation of the Arctic Oscillation, Scandinavian pattern, east Atlantic–western Eurasian pattern, and p...},

abstract = {El Ni{\~{n}}o and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most prominent year-to-year climate fluctuation on Earth, alternating between anomalously warm (El Ni{\~{n}}o) and cold (La Ni{\~{n}}a) sea surface temperature (SST) conditions in the tropical Pacific. ENSO exerts its impacts on remote regions of the globe through atmospheric teleconnections, affecting extreme weather events worldwide. However, these teleconnections are inherently nonlinear and sensitive to ENSO SST anomaly patterns and amplitudes. In addition, teleconnections are modulated by variability in the oceanic and atmopsheric mean state outside the tropics and by land and sea ice extent. The character of ENSO as well as the ocean mean state have changed since the 1990s, which might be due to either natural variability or anthropogenic forcing, or their combined influences. This has resulted in changes in ENSO atmospheric teleconnections in terms of precipitation and temperature in various parts of the globe. In addition, changes in ENSO teleconnection patterns have affected their predictability and the statistics of extreme events. However, the short observational record does not allow us to clearly distinguish which changes are robust and which are not. Climate models suggest that ENSO teleconnections will change because the mean atmospheric circulation will change due to anthropogenic forcing in the 21st century, which is independent of whether ENSO properties change or not. However, future ENSO teleconnection changes do not currently show strong intermodel agreement from region to region, highlighting the importance of identifying factors that affect uncertainty in future model projections.},

Identifying the effects of global warming on regional water cycle extremes, such as the ongoing drought in California, remains a challenge. Here we analyse large-ensemble and multi-model simulations that project the future of water cycle extremes in California as well as to understand those associations that pertain to changing climate oscillations under global warming. Both intense drought and excessive flooding are projected to increase by at least 50{\%} towards the end of the twenty-first century; this projected increase in water cycle extremes is associated with a strengthened relation to El Ni{\~{n}}o and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) - in particular, extreme El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events that modulate California's climate not only through its warm and cold phases but also its precursor patterns.},

abstract = {This study compares two approaches, dynamical and statistical downscaling, for their potential to improve regional seasonal forecasts for the United States (U.S.) during the cold season. In the MultiRCM Ensemble Downscaling (MRED) project, seven regional climate models (RCMs) are used to dynamically downscale the Climate Forecast System (CFS) seasonal prediction over the conterminous U.S. out to 5months for the period of 1982-2003. The simulations cover December to April of next year with 10 ensemble members from each RCM with different initial and boundary conditions from the corresponding ensemble members. These dynamically downscaled forecasts are compared with statistically downscaled forecasts produced by two bias correction Methods applied to both the CFS and RCM forecasts. Results of the comparison suggest that the RCMs add value in seasonal prediction application, but the improvements largely depend on location, forecast lead time, variables, and skill metrics used for evaluation. Generally, more improvements are found over the Northwest and North Central U.S. for the shorter lead times. The comparison Results also suggest a hybrid forecast system that combines both dynamical and statistical downscaling Methods have the potential to maximize prediction skill. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {The countries of Central Asia are collectively known as the five ''-stans'': Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. In recent times, the Central Asian region has been affected by the shrinkage of the Aral Sea, widespread desertification, soil salinization, biodiversity loss, frequent sand storms, and many other ecological disasters. This paper is a review article based upon the collection, identification and collation of previous studies of environmental changes and regional developments in Central Asia in the past 30 years. Most recent studies have reached a consensus that the temperature rise in Central Asia is occurring faster than the global average. This warming trend will not only result in a higher evaporation in the basin oases, but also to a significant retreat of glaciers in the mountainous areas. Water is the key to sustainable development in the arid and semi-arid regions in Central Asia. The uneven distribution, over consumption, and pollution of water resources in Central Asia have caused severe water supply problems, which have been affecting regional harmony and development for the past 30 years. The widespread and significant land use changes in the 1990s could be used to improve our understanding of natural variability and human interaction in the region. There has been a positive trend of trans-border cooperation among the Central Asian countries in recent years. International attention has grown and research projects have been initiated to provide water and ecosystem protection in Central Asia. However, the agreements that have been reached might not be able to deliver practical action in time to prevent severe ecological disasters. Water management should be based on hydrographic borders and ministries should be able to make timely decisions without political intervention. Fully integrated management of water resources, land use and industrial development is essential in Central Asia. The ecological crisis should provide sufficient motivation to reach a consensus on unified water management throughout the region.},

abstract = {Vegetation changes play a vital role in modifying local temperatures although, until now, the climate feedback effects of vegetation changes are still poorly known and large uncertainties exist, especially over Central Asia. In this study, using remote sensing and re-analysis of existing data, we evaluated the impact of vegetation changes on local temperatures. Our results indicate that vegetation changes have a significant unidirectional causality relationship with regard to local temperature changes. We found that vegetation greening over Central Asia as a whole induced a cooling effect on the local temperatures. We also found that evapotranspiration (ET) exhibits greater sensitivity to the increases of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as compared to albedo in arid/semi-arid/semi-humid regions, potentially leading to a cooling effect. However, in humid regions, albedo warming completely surpasses ET cooling, causing a pronounced warming. Our findings suggest that using appropriate strategies to protect vulnerable dryland ecosystems from degradation, should lead to future benefits related to greening ecosystems and mitigation for rising temperatures.},

abstract = {Abstract. Two ice core boreholes of 143.18 m and 447.73 m (bedrock) were drilled during the 2009–2010 austral summer on the Bruce Plateau at a location named LARISSA Site Beta (66°02' S, 64°04' W, 1975.5 m a.s.l.). Both boreholes were logged with thermistors shortly after drilling. The shallow borehole was instrumented for 4 months with a series of resistance thermometers with satellite uplink. Surface temperature proxy data derived from an inversion of the borehole temperature profiles are compared to available multi-decadal records from weather stations and ice cores located along a latitudinal transect of the Antarctic Peninsula to West Antarctica. The LARISSA Site Beta profiles show temperatures decreasing from the surface downward through the upper third of the ice, and warming thereafter to the bed. The average temperature for the most recent year is −14.78°C (measured at 15 m depth, abbreviated T15). A minimum temperature of −15.8°C is measured at 173 m depth, and basal temperature is estimated to be −10.2°C. Current mean annual temperature and the gradient in the lower part of the measured temperature profile have a best fit with an accumulation rate of 1.9×103 kg m−2 a−1 and basal heat flux (q) of 88 mW m−2, if steady-state conditions are assumed. However, the mid-level temperature variations show that recent temperature has varied significantly. Reconstructed surface temperatures (Ts=T15) over the last 200 yr are derived by an inversion technique (Tikhonov and Samarskii, 1990). From this, we find that cold temperatures (minimum Ts=−16.2°C) prevailed from {\~{}}1920 to {\~{}}1940, followed by a gradual rise of temperature to −14.2°C around 1995, then cooling over the following decade and warming in the last few years. The coldest period was preceded by a relatively warm 19th century at T15≥−15°C. To facilitate regional comparisons of the surface temperature history, we use our T15 data and nearby weather station records to refine estimates of lapse rates (altitudinal, adjusted for latitude: $\Gamma$a(l)). Good temporal and spatial consistency of $\Gamma$a(l) over the last 35 yr are observed, implying that the climate trends observed here are regional and consistent over a broad altitude range.},

abstract = {The diagnostic potential natural vegetation (PNV) model, VERDE (Vegetation Reconstruction by Diagnostic Equilibrium), recently developed by the authors, is coupled to the Italian regional climate model (RegCM) ICTP, and is implemented in the European and Mediterranean regions. This study assesses the effect of anthropic land use on the present-day climate in these regions, and computes the climate associated with the PNV through iteration of a 2-step procedure, composed of a multi-annual model simulation and subsequent computation by VERDE of the PNV corresponding to the simulated climate. In the first iteration, RegCM adopts the present land use (which over Europe is dominated by crops and farming, with very little natural vegetation). The procedure is iterated until there is no appreciable difference between the PNV used by RegCM, and that associated with the climate that it produces, so that the PNV and model climate are consistent. The equilibrium PNV consists mainly of shrubs in the Mediterranean and deciduous broadleaf forest in central Europe. The effect of anthropic land use on climate is assessed by analyzing the difference between the simulated present-day anthropic land use and PNV climates, which is given by the difference between the first and the last iterations of the procedure. We found that anthropic land use produces cooler summers, and identified 2 different mechanisms: (1) over the Balkan Peninsula, anthropic land use modifies the surface energy balance by increasing evapotranspiration; (2) over central-western Europe, cooling is mostly due to cloudier sky conditions. These results show: (1) that reforestation may not be appropriate as a tool for climate change mitigation at the regional scale, and (2) expansion of agricultural land use may have reduced past warming signals at the regional scale, though historical records of land-use evolution suggest that this effect is probably small for Europe during the 20th century. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract = {Abstract In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model was coupled with an improved Noah land surface model (WRF-Noah) where dynamic flood and drip irrigation processes were implemented firstly. We simulated the different irrigation effects on surface water-heat processes in a typical mountain-oasis-desert system in Central Asia for both wet and drought years, respectively, using the modified WRF-Noah. The modified WRF-Noah model can dynamically generate amounts of irrigation in agreement with actual values. The statistically significant decrease in the root mean square error and increase in the Pearson correlation coefficient for the 2-m temperature (T2), relative humidity (RH), latent heat flux (LE), and precipitation suggest that the modified WRF-Noah model was improved by implementing irrigation processes. During the irrigation season, flood and drip irrigation decreased the average sensible heat flux by ?80.69 and ?50.50 W/m2 and T2 by 1.09 and 0.82 °C over the irrigated area and increased LE by 88.47 and 66.70 W/m2 and RH by 6.23{\%} and 4.65{\%}, respectively. Throughout the domain, flood irrigation had equivalent or slightly weaker effects on near-surface temperature and humidity due to the smaller irrigated area. Both flood and drip irrigation increased precipitation throughout the domain, especially in the mountainous area, thereby accelerating the hydrological cycle in the mountain-oasis-desert system. The local oasis breeze circulation that plays a role in maintaining the oasis stability is still counteracted by the dominant background circulation even with irrigation processes. Thus, more effort should be exerted to maintain the future sustainability of the oasis.},

The present study finds that the largest increases in annual temperature are observed at stations in the low altitude regions.

The increasing trends in annual precipitation are found from the middle to high altitude areas, but decreasing trends are found in the low altitude areas. The significant increasing trends in precipitation occur mostly in winter and earlier spring at stations from the middle to high altitudes, while the increasing and decreasing trend coexists at stations of low altitude with most of the significant trend changes occurring in March, June and August.},

In this study, we investigated spatial-temporal variation trends and abrupt changes in 17 indices of climate extremes, based on daily climate observations from 55 meteorological stations in CA during 1957–2005. We also speculated as to which atmospheric circulation factors had the greatest impacts on climate extremes. Our results indicated that the annual mean temperature (Tav), mean maximum and minimum temperature significantly increased at a rate of 0.32{\textordmasculine}C/10a, 0.24{\textordmasculine}C/10a and 0.41{\textordmasculine}C/10a, respectively, which was far higher than the increasing rates either globally or across the Northern Hemisphere. Other temperature extremes showed widespread significant warming trends, especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature. All temperature extremes exhibited spatially widespread rising trends. Compared to temperature changes, precipitation extremes showed higher spatial and temporal variabilities. The annual total precipitation significantly increased at a rate of 4.76 mm/10a, and all precipitation extremes showed rising trends except for annual maximum consecutive dry days (CDD), which significantly decreased at a rate of –3.17 days/10a. On the whole, precipitation extremes experienced slight wetter trends in the Tianshan Mountains, Kazakhskiy Melkosopochnik (Hill), the Kyzylkum Desert and most of Xinjiang. The results of Cumulative Deviation showed that Tav and Txav had a significant abrupt change around 1987, and all precipitation indices experienced abrupt changes in 1986. Spearman's correlation analysis pointed to Siberian High and Tibetan Plateau Index{\_}B as possibly being the most important atmospheric circulation factors affecting climate extremes in CA. A full quantitative understanding of these changes is crucial for the management and mitigation of natural hazards in this region.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} An ensemble simulation of five regional climate models (RCMs) from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment in East Asia is evaluated and used to project future regional climate change in China. The influences of model uncertainty and internal variability on projections are also identified. The RCMs simulate the historical (1980–2005) climate and future (2006–2049) climate projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) RCP4.5 scenario. The simulations for five subregions in China, including northeastern China, northern China, southern China, northwestern China, and the Tibetan Plateau, are highlighted in this study. Results show that (1) RCMs can capture the climatology, annual cycle, and interannual variability of temperature and precipitation and that a multi-model ensemble (MME) outperforms that of an individual RCM. The added values for RCMs are confirmed by comparing the performance of RCMs and global climate models (GCMs) in reproducing annual and seasonal mean precipitation and temperature during the historical period. (2) For future (2030–2049) climate, the MME indicates consistent warming trends at around 1{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}°C in the entire domain and projects pronounced warming in northern and western China. The annual precipitation is likely to increase in most of the simulation region, except for the Tibetan Plateau. (3) Generally, the future projected change in annual and seasonal mean temperature by RCMs is nearly consistent with the results from the driving GCM. However, changes in annual and seasonal mean precipitation exhibit significant inter-RCM differences and possess a larger magnitude and variability than the driving GCM. Even opposite signals for projected changes in average precipitation between the MME and the driving GCM are shown over southern China, northeastern China, and the Tibetan Plateau. (4) The uncertainty in projected mean temperature mainly arises from the internal variability over northern and southern China and the model uncertainty over the other three subregions. For the projected mean precipitation, the dominant uncertainty source is the internal variability over most regions, except for the Tibetan Plateau, where the model uncertainty reaches up to 60{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\%}. Moreover, the model uncertainty increases with prediction lead time across all subregions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {At the beginning of the 21st century, the July and August (JA) mean upper-tropospheric temperature over East Asia shows a significant increasing trend, contrary to the decreasing trend in the late 1970 s. The largest warming center is over northern China (between 30°N–45°N and 85°E–120°E) around 300 hPa. Together with the temperature rising, the geo-potential height rises above the warming center and drops below, which connects closely to a correspondingly significant decadal shift of the general circulation over East Asia. In the upper-level of the troposphere, an anomalous anti-cyclone dominates, and the 200–hPa westerly jet strengthens due to the increasing pole-ward geo-potential height gradient. In the lower-troposphere, the anomalous southerly wind increases around Yangtze River Valley and the East Asian summer monsoon intensifies. The integrated circulation changes seriously impact summer precipitation over East Asia. The so-called “southern flood and northern drought” (SFND) pattern since the 1970 s over eastern China has changed. As the cooling center in the 1970 s moves southward, the dry belt moves southward as well. A wet belt dominates the Huaihe River Valley after the temperature trend reversal at 2005 while southern China experiences a dry condition.},

abstract = {Abstract. Snow depth is one of the key physical parameters for understanding land surface energy balance, soil thermal regime, water cycle, and assessing water resources from local community to regional industrial water supply. Previous studies by using in situ data are mostly site specific; data from satellite remote sensing may cover a large area or global scale, but uncertainties remain large. The primary objective of this study is to investigate spatial variability and temporal change in snow depth across the Eurasian continent. Data used include long-term (1966–2012) ground-based measurements from 1814 stations. Spatially, long-term (1971–2000) mean annual snow depths of {\textgreater}20 cm were recorded in northeastern European Russia, the Yenisei River basin, Kamchatka Peninsula, and Sakhalin. Annual mean and maximum snow depth increased by 0.2 and 0.6 cm decade−1 from 1966 through 2012. Seasonally, monthly mean snow depth decreased in autumn and increased in winter and spring over the study period. Regionally, snow depth significantly increased in areas north of 50° N. Compared with air temperature, snowfall had greater influence on snow depth during November through March across the former Soviet Union. This study provides a baseline for snow depth climatology and changes across the Eurasian continent, which would significantly help to better understanding climate system and climate changes on regional, hemispheric, or even global scales.},

abstract = {East Asia is dominated by a typical monsoon climate. The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) exhibits considerable variability on a wide range of time scales during the 20th century. A substantial portion is the multi-decadal variability. Over the recent decades, the EASM has been weakening from the end of the 1970s which results in a "southern China flood and northern China drought" rainfall pattern. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the weakening tendency has been a challenge for climate research community. Examinations on the long-term change of the EASM during the 20th century find no significant trends, indicating the pronounced weakening tendency of the EASM in recent decades is unprecedented. After documenting the prominent features of the interdecadal climate transition, a review is presented in this paper on the proposed explanations to the observed changes. The proposed factors include the Indian Ocean and far western Pacific warming, the tropical central-eastern Pacific warming, the weakening sensible heat source over the Tibetan Plateau, and the aerosol forcing, as well as internal variability. While parts of the monsoon circulation changes can be explained in terms of the proposed mechanisms, it is still beyond the scope of our current knowledge to present a complete picture. Much remains to be learned about the mechanisms that produce such multi-decadal changes in the EASM, but it seems still unclear whether human activities and global warming are playing significant roles.},

abstract = {The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) is an international community-based infrastructure that supports climate model intercomparison, climate variability, climate prediction, and climate projection. Improving the performance of climate models over East Asia and the western North Pacific has been a challenge for the climate-modeling community. In this paper, we provide a synthesis robustness analysis of the climate models participating in CMIP-Phase 5 (CMIP5). The strengths and weaknesses of the CMIP5 models are assessed from the perspective of climate mean state, interannual variability, past climate change during the mid-Pliocene (MP) and the last millennium, and climate projection. The added values of regional climate models relative to the driving global climate models are also assessed. Although an encouraging increase in credibility and an improvement in the simulation of mean states, interannual variability, and past climate changes are visible in the progression from CMIP3 to CMIP5, some previously noticed biases such as the ridge position of the western North Pacific subtropical high and the associated rainfall bias are still evident in CMIP5 models. Weaknesses are also evident in simulations of the interannual amplitude, such as El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-monsoon relationships. Coupled models generally show better results than standalone atmospheric models in simulating both mean states and interannual variability. Multi-model intercomparison indicates significant uncertainties in the future projection of climate change, although precipitation increases consistently across models constrained by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. Regional ocean-atmosphere coupled models are recommended for the dynamical downscaling of climate change projections over the East Asia-western North Pacific domain.},

abstract = {Observations show that the surface diurnal temperature range (DTR) has decreased since 1950s over most global land areas due to a smaller warming in maximum temperatures (Tmax) than in minimum temperatures (Tmin). This paper analyzes the trends and variability in Tmax, Tmin, and DTR over land in observations and 48 simulations from 12 global coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models for the later half of the 20th century. It uses the modeled changes in surface downward solar and longwave radiation to interpret the modeled temperature changes. When anthropogenic and natural forcings are included, the models generally reproduce observed major features of the warming of Tmax and Tmin and the reduction of DTR. As expected the greenhouse gases enhanced surface downward longwave radiation (DLW) explains most of the warming of Tmax and Tmin while decreased surface downward shortwave radiation (DSW) due to increasing aerosols and water vapor contributes most to the decreases in DTR in the models. When only natural forcings are used, none of the observed trends are simulated. The simulated DTR decreases are much smaller than the observed (mainly due to the small simulated Tmin trend) but still outside the range of natural internal variability estimated from the models. The much larger observed decrease in DTR suggests the possibility of additional regional effects of anthropogenic forcing that the models can not realistically simulate, likely connected to changes in cloud cover, precipitation, and soil moisture. The small magnitude of the simulated DTR trends may be attributed to the lack of an increasing trend in cloud cover and deficiencies in charactering aerosols and important surface and boundary-layer processes in the models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {AbstractUsing station data and Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) simulations under the representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario, this article addresses historical and future changes of the wintertime snowfall over China. The observational results generally show a decrease in the frequency and an increase in the mean intensity of snowfalls in northwestern China (NWC), northeastern China (NEC), the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP), and southeastern China (SEC) since the 1960s. The total amount of wintertime snowfall, however, has increased in NWC, NEC, and ETP but decreased in SEC. The decrease in snow days is primarily due to the reduction of light snowfall events. The increase in the total amount is primarily explained by increases in heavy snowfalls, and the corresponding decrease is the result of decreases in light-to-heavy snowfalls. The RegCM4 ensemble, which can well simulate the observed snowfall climatology, projects that the snow days will be further reduced by the end of the twenty-first century relative to 1986?2005, primarily owing to the decline of light snowfall events. The total amount is projected to increase in NWC but decrease in the other three subregions. The increase in the total amount in NWC is attributed to increases in heavy and large snowfalls. Decreases in light snowfalls play a leading role in the decrease of the total amount in NEC. In ETP and SEC, the decrease in the total amount is the result of overall decreases in light-to-heavy snowfalls. The mechanism for such changes is an interesting topic to study in the future.},

abstract = { AbstractPrecipitation is expected to increase under global warming. However, large discrepancies in precipitation sensitivities to global warming among observations and models have been reported, partly owing to the large natural variability of precipitation, which accounts for over 90{\%} of its total variance in China. Here, the authors first elucidated precipitation sensitivities to the long-term warming trend and interannual–decadal variations of surface air temperature Ta over China based on daily data from approximately 2000 stations from 1961 to 2014. The results show that the number of dry, trace, and light precipitation days has stronger sensitivities to the warming trend than to the Ta interannual–decadal variation, with 14.1{\%}, −35.7{\%}, and −14.6{\%} K−1 versus 2.7{\%}, −7.9{\%}, and −3.1{\%} K−1, respectively. Total precipitation frequency has significant sensitivities to the warming trend (−18.5{\%} K−1) and the Ta interannual–decadal variation (−3.6{\%} K−1) over China. However, very heavy precipitation frequencies exhibit larger sensitivities to the Ta interannual–decadal variation than to the long-term trend over Northwest and Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau. A warming trend boosts precipitation intensity, especially for light precipitation (9.8{\%} K−1). Total precipitation intensity increases significantly by 13.1{\%} K−1 in response to the warming trend and by 3.3{\%} K−1 in response to the Ta interannual–decadal variation. Very heavy precipitation intensity also shows significant sensitivity to the interannual–decadal variation of Ta (3.7{\%} K−1), particularly in the cold season (8.0{\%} K−1). Combining precipitation frequency and intensity, total precipitation amount has a negligible sensitivity to the warming trend, and the consequent trend in China is limited. Moderate and heavy precipitation amounts are dominated by their frequencies. },

Driven by the ERAInterim reanalysis data, the model was integrated from 1988 to 2010 with a high resolution of 0.22°. The model's ability to reproduce mean climatology and climatic extremes is evaluated based on various aspects. The CCLM model is capable of capturing the basic features of the East Asia climate, including the seasonal mean patterns, interannual variations, annual cycles and climate extreme indices for both surface air temperature and precipitation. Some biases are evident in certain areas and seasons. Warm and wet biases appear in the arid and semi-arid areas over the northwestern and northern parts of the domain. The simulated climate over the Tibetan Plateau is colder and wetter than the observations, while South China, East China, and India are drier. The model biases may be caused by the simulated anticyclonic and cyclonic biases in low-level circulations, the simulated water vapor content biases, and the inadequate physical parameterizations in the CCLM model. A parallel 0.44° simulation is conducted and the comparison results show some added value introduced by the higher resolution 0.22° simulation. As a result, the CCLM model could be an adequate member for the next stage of the CORDEX-EA project, while further studies should be encouraged.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of radiation schemes on the performance of a climate version of the Weather, Research and Forecasting (CLWRF) model over a domain covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), so often called the Arab domain. The ability of the model to reproduce recent past climate conditions was tested with 30-year simulations that cover the 1981–2010 period. The model was driven by the ERA-Interim reanalyses at a horizontal resolution of 50 km. We explored the sensitivity of the model to the short- and long-wave (LW) radiation parameterizations by testing the RRTMG and CAM3 schemes in order to optimize the model performance as a contribution to the MENA-CORDEX initiative. The results have been compared with gridded surface observational data and satellite measurements for several variables, including mean, maximum and minimum 2-m air temperature, total cloud cover and surface short- and LW radiation fluxes. The model is found to capture reasonably well the inter-annual variability and the observed warming trends over the last three decades. Although we generally found that CAM3 driven simulations are relatively cooler than the RRTMG driven ones, each radiation scheme can give better results depending on the season, location and dominant land use type of each of the model's grid point. The largest discrepancies between these hindcast simulations are found over the desert part of the domain while they are found to closely agree over southern Europe.},

Five up-to-date gridded observational datasets are employed. Besides mean annual values, trends of six indices of drought and extreme precipitation are also considered in the analysis. Most important findings include the significant negative trends over the Maghreb, Levant, Arabian Peninsula, and Sahel regions that are evident since the beginning of the twentieth century and are more or less extended to today. On the other hand, for some Mediterranean regions such as the Balkans and the Anatolian Plateau, precipitation records during the most recent decades indicate a significant increasing trend and a recovering from the dry conditions that occurred during the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. The fact that over parts of the study region the selected datasets were found to have substantial differences in terms of mean climate, trends, and interannual variability, motivated the more thorough investigation of the precipitation observational uncertainty. Several aspects, such as annual and monthly mean climatologies and also discrepancies in the monthly time-series distribution, are discussed using common methods in the field of climatology but also more sophisticated, nonparametric approaches such as the Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn's tests. Results indicate that in the best case, the data sources are found to have statistically significant differences in the distribution of monthly precipitation for about 50{\%} of the study region extent. This percentage is increased up to 70{\%} when particular datasets are compared. Indicatively, the range between the tested rainfall datasets is found to be more than 20{\%} of their mean annual values for most of the extent of MENA, while locally, for the hyper-arid regions, this percentage is increased up to 100{\%}. Precipitation observational uncertainty is also profound for parts of southern Europe. Outlier datasets over individual regions are identified in order to be more cautiously used in future regional climate studies.},

abstract = {In this study, a developed regional ocean–atmosphere coupled model FROALS was applied to the CORDEX East Asia domain. The performance of FROALS in the simulation of Asian summer monsoon during 1989–2010 was assessed using the metrics developed by the CLIVAR Asian–Australian Monsoon Panel Diagnostics Task Team. The results indicated that FROALS exhibited good performance in simulating Asian summer monsoon climatology. The simulated JJA mean SST biases were weaker than those of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble mean (MMEM). The skill of FROALS approached that of CMIP5 MMEM in terms of the annual cycle of Asian summer monsoon. The simulated monsoon duration matched the observed counterpart well (with a spatial pattern correlation coefficient of 0.59). Some biases of CMIP5 MMEM were also found in FROALS, highlighting the importance of local forcing and model physics within the Asian monsoon domain. Corresponding to a strong East Asian summer monsoon, an anomalous anticyclone was found over western North Pacific in both observation and simulation. However, the simulated strength was weaker than the observed due to the responses to incorrect sea surface anomalies over the key regions. The model also accurately captured the spatial pattern of the intraseasonal variability variance and the extreme climate indices of Asian summer monsoons, although with larger amplitude. The results suggest that FROALS could be used as a dynamical downscaling tool nested within the global climate model with coarse resolution to develop high-resolution regional climate change projections over the CORDEX East Asia domain.},
