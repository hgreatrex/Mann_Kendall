Abstract = {On a hemispheric scale, it is now well established that stratospheric
   ozone depletion has been the principal driver of externally forced
   atmospheric circulation changes south of the Equator in the last decades
   of the 20th Century. The impact of ozone depletion has been felt over
   the entire hemisphere, as reflected in the poleward drift of the
   midlatitude jet, the southward expansion of the summertime Hadley cell
   and accompanying precipitation trends deep into the subtropics. On a
   regional scale, however, surface impacts directly attributable to ozone
   depletion have yet to be identified. In this paper we focus on South
   Eastern South America (SESA), a region that has exhibited one of the
   largest wetting trends during the 20th Century. We study the impact of
   ozone depletion on SESA precipitation using output from 6 different
   climate models, spanning a wide range of complexity. In all cases we
   contrast pairs of model integrations with and without ozone depletion,
   but with all other forcings identically specified. This allows for
   unambiguous attribution of the computed precipitation trends. All 6
   climate models consistently reveal that stratospheric ozone depletion
   results in a significant wetting of SESA over the period 1960-1999.
   Taken as a whole, these model results strongly suggest that the impact
   of ozone depletion on SESA precipitation has been as large as, and quite
   possibly larger than, the one caused by increasing greenhouse gases over
   the same period.},

Title = {Trends of heavy precipitation and wet and dry spells in Switzerland

Abstract = {The low-frequency variability of heavy precipitation and drought
   conditions is investigated for 104 rain-gauge stations in Switzerland
   covering the 20th century. This constitutes an exceptionally dense data
   set of centennial time series. The investigation is based on a wide
   range of daily and multi-day precipitation statistics encompassing basic
   characteristics, measures of heavy precipitation and indices of typical
   and extreme dry and wet spells. Two different methods of trend analysis
   and statistical testing are applied, depending on the data nature of the
   statistic. Linear regression is used for statistics with a continuous
   value range, and logistic regression is used for statistics with a
   discrete value range. The trends are calculated on a seasonal basis for
   the years 1901-2000.
   A clear trend signal is found for winter and autumn, with a high number
   of sites with a statistically significant trend. In winter, significant
   increases are found for all statistics related to precipitation strength
   and occurrence. The centennial increase is between 10 and 30\% for the
   high quantiles and the seasonal 1 day to 10 day extremes. In autumn,
   statistically significant increases are found only for the statistics
   related to heavy precipitation, whereas precipitation frequency and
   spell-length statistics show little systematic change. Although the
   winter trend signal is strongest in northern and western Switzerland,
   the autumn trend signal is more uniform. In spring and summer, the heavy
   precipitation and the spell-duration statistics did not show
   statistically significant trends. Sensitivity tests indicate that the
   winter and autumn trends are robust with respect to inhomogeneities in
   the rain-gauge time series. Copyright (c) 2005 Royal Meteorological

Title = {Temporal trends of Dechlorane Plus in air and precipitation around the
   North American Great Lakes},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {642},
Pages = {537-542},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Dechlorane Plus (DP) is a chlorinated flame retardant manufactured only
   in Niagara Falls, New York and in Huai'an, China. To determine if the
   environmental levels of this compound were changing significantly, we
   measured the long-term temporal trends of its concentrations near the
   Great Lakes between 2005 and 2015 using air (vapor particle phase)
   samples (N = 1047) and precipitation samples (N = 449). We used a
   multiple linear regression model of DP concentrations to isolate the
   variabilities due to sampling date and population near the sampling
   site. The results show that the total DP concentrations in precipitation
   varied seasonally, maximizing on January 18, but the concentrations in
   the vapor particle phase did not show seasonal variations. Vapor +
   particle phase DP levels were relatively high in Cleveland, and
   precipitation DP levels were relatively high at Point Petre. DP's
   concentrations in neither phase were changing as a function of sampling
   date, indicating that the input of this compound into the environment is
   continuing, presumably because its use and production are not regulated.
   Based on the ratio of the anti conformer relative to the total of the
   two conformer concentrations, we suggest that the syn conformer is
   somewhat more environmentally stable than the anti conformer. (C) 2018

Abstract = {A statistical scheme based on the Kendall statistic, Fisher's method,
   the modified Welch t test, and the Gumbel distribution as a special case
   of the general extreme value distribution was developed to explore the
   causes of the apparent trends in environmental variables. Daily
   precipitation data extending as far back as 1898 for gauges in the
   Nueces, Guadalupe, and San Antonio river basins indicate that the annual
   maximum daily precipitation depths and the annual 5-day maximum
   precipitation depth have been generally increasing. The statistical
   analysis reveals that urbanization, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and
   localized random effects do not contribute to these trends. The results
   indicate that climate change or other unknown regional phenomena would
   be the main cause for the increasing trend. The methodology developed
   can be employed in global change studies to identify the contribution of
   climate change and other factors, such as societal dynamics, on observed
   trends in environmental variables.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a review of trend analysis of extreme precipitation
   and hydrological floods in Europe based on observations and future
   climate projections. The review summaries methods and methodologies
   applied and key findings from a large number of studies. Reported
   analyses of observed extreme precipitation and flood records show that
   there is some evidence of a general increase in extreme precipitation,
   whereas there are no clear indications of significant trends at
   large-scale regional or national level of extreme streamflow. Several
   studies from regions dominated by snowmelt-induced peak flows report
   decreases in extreme streamflow and earlier spring snowmelt peak flows,
   likely caused by increasing temperature. The review of likely future
   changes based on climate projections indicates a general increase in
   extreme precipitation under a future climate, which is consistent with
   the observed trends. Hydrological projections of peak flows show large
   impacts in many areas with both positive and negative changes. A general
   decrease in flood magnitude and earlier spring floods are projected for
   catchments with snowmelt-dominated peak flows, which is consistent with
   the observed trends. Finally, existing guidelines in Europe on design
   flood and design rainfall estimation are reviewed. The review shows that
   only few countries have developed guidelines that incorporate a
   consideration of climate change impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Trends in Taxonomic and Functional Composition of Soil Microbiome Along

Abstract = {The soil microbiome is important for the functioning of terrestrial
   ecosystems. However, the impacts of climate on taxonomic and functional
   diversity of soil microbiome are not well understood. A precipitation
   gradient along regional scale transects may offer a model setting for
   understanding the effect of climate on the composition and function of
   the soil microbiome. Here, we compared taxonomic and functional
   attributes of soil microorganisms in arid, semiarid, Mediterranean, and
   humid Mediterranean climatic conditions of Israel using shotgun
   metagenomic sequencing. We hypothesized that there would be a distinct
   taxonomic and functional soil community for each precipitation zone,
   with arid environments having lower taxonomic and functional diversity,
   greater relative abundance of stress response and sporulation-related
   genes, and lower relative abundance of genes related to nutrient cycling
   and degradation of complex organic compounds. As hypothesized, our
   results showed a distinct taxonomic and functional community in each
   precipitation zone, revealing differences in soil taxonomic and
   functional selection in the different climates. Although the taxonomic
   diversity remained similar across all sites, the functional diversity
   was-as hypothesized-lower in the arid environments, suggesting that
   functionality is more constrained in ``extreme{''} environments. Also,
   with increasing aridity, we found a significant increase in genes
   related to dormancy/sporulation and a decrease in those related to
   nutrient cycling (genes related to nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur
   metabolism), respectively. However, relative abundance of genes related
   to stress response were lower in arid soils. Overall, these results
   indicate that climatic conditions play an important role in shaping
   taxonomic and functional attributes of soil microbiome. These findings
   have important implications for understanding the impacts of climate
   change (e.g., precipitation change) on structure and function of the
   soil microbiome.},

   seasons are compared with corresponding trends in reanalysis products.
   From 1979 to 2011, mean precipitation decreased at 75\% of the stations
   during the long rains' (March to May) and increased at 70\% of the
   stations during the short rains' (October to December). Corresponding
   trends are found in the number of heavy precipitation days, and maximum
   of consecutive 5-day precipitation. Conversely, an increase in
   consecutive dry days within both main rainy seasons is found. However,
   trends are only statistically significant in very few cases. Reanalysis
   data sets agree with observations with respect to interannual
   variability, while correlations are considerably lower for monthly
   deviations (ratios) from the mean annual cycle. While some products well
   reproduce the rainfall climatology and some the spatial trend pattern,
   no product reproduces both.},

Abstract = {An investigation of 54 years of hourly precipitation at Valentia, on the
   south-west coast of Ireland, shows a change point in the annual amounts
   in the years around 1975 (identified by the Pettitt-Mann-Whitney
   statistic). This results in a 10\% increase in the mean annual
   precipitation from a pre-1975 value of 1375 mm to a post-1975 value of
   1507 mm. Most of that increase is absorbed in the months of March and
   October. The frequency of hourly precipitation in March in the post-1975
   period is 57\% greater than that of March in the pre-1975 period.
   However, the magnitude of the hourly intensity of precipitation in March
   for both periods was similar. Significant changes in wet hour frequency
   also occurred in October with no corresponding change in hourly
   intensity. These results compliment findings by others, that regions in
   Northern European latitudes have experienced an increase in
   precipitation since the mid-1970s. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {Holocene records for the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) indicate that, apart
   for the last 2,000 years ({''}2 kyr shift{''}), solar insolation was the

   is to provide a synopsis of climate characteristics over the last 2 kyr,
   clarifying mechanisms for the diverse trend with Northern Hemisphere
   Summer Insolation (NHSI) records. Here, we initially review proxy-based
   climate reconstructions for the last 2 kyr, and then compare them with
   records from the last five interglacial periods. Finally, we examine
   potential physical mechanisms responsible for the ``2 kyr shift.{''}
   Findings from this review indicate that the ``2 kyr shift{''} is a
   representative pattern of Holocene climate change within the core area
   of the ASM, and the ``2 kyr shift{''} could be mainly controlled by
   changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. In addition, suggestions to
   address a more humid condition dominating the Asian monsoonal margin
   zones are offered.},

Title = {PV-pumped energy storage option for convalescing performance of
   hydroelectric station under declining precipitation trend},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {135},
Pages = {288-302},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The precipitation trend is critically important for functioning of
   hydroelectric power stations and development of irrigation sector.
   Studies indicate that freshwater availability in many river basins in
   India is likely to decrease due to climate change. Despite having
   promising hydro potential in north-eastern (N-E) region of India,
   decline in rainfall in the region causes paucity of water in various
   hydro power plants' reservoirs. Many units of hydroelectric projects are
   being kept off and as a result, generation comes down to a large extent.
   As a partial solution to the problem, many such small hydroelectric
   projects' may be revived by integrating solar photovoltaic (PV) powered
   pumped storage unit as there is synergy of solar energy with irrigation
   water pumping and hydro power station. The present study aims to looking
   at reliable, continuous and cost-competitive power supply option. The
   study has been conceived with the lone hydroelectric power station of
   Tripura (one of the N-E states of India) which practically remains
   inoperative as water is hardly available at the end of the year and
   before next monsoon. Results substantiate that PV powered pumped storage
   is a viable option for restoring the steady annual performance of the
   hydroelectric plant. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Uncertainty in Simulating Twentieth Century West African Precipitation
   Trends: The Role of Anthropogenic Aerosol Emissions},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic aerosol emissions from North America and Europe have
   strong effects on the decadal variability of the West African monsoon
   (WAM). Anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing is model
   dependent, but the impact of such uncertainty on the simulation of
   long-term WAM variability is unknown. We use an ensemble of simulations
   with HadGEM3-GC3.1 that span the most recent estimates in simulated
   anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing. We show that
   uncertainty in anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing leads to
   significant uncertainty at simulating multi-decadal trends in West
   African precipitation. At the large scale, larger forcing leads to a
   larger decrease in the interhemispheric temperature gradients, in
   temperature over both the North Atlantic Ocean and northern Sahara.
   There are also differences in dynamic changes specific to the WAM
   (locations of the Saharan heat low and African Easterly Jet, of the
   strength of the West African westerly jet, and of African Easterly Wave
   activity). We also assess effects on monsoon precipitation
   characteristics and temperature. We show that larger aerosol forcing
   results in a decrease of the number of rainy days and of heavy and
   extreme precipitation events and warm spells. However, simulated changes
   in onset and demise dates do not appear to be sensitive to the magnitude
   of aerosol forcing. Our results demonstrate the importance of reducing
   the uncertainty in anthropogenic aerosol forcing for understanding and
   predicting multi-decadal variability in the WAM.
   Plain Language Summary The Sahelian drought of the 1970s and 1980s had
   consequences on agriculture, economy, and population migration, among
   others. The Sahelian drought is known to be partly caused by emissions
   of aerosol pollution from North America and Europe, leading to a
   reduction in rainfall for West Africa. However, the effect of aerosol
   pollution on atmospheric radiation-the light and heat that passes
   through the atmosphere-is uncertain, and the models we use to examine
   past and future climate change show a wide range of responses to these
   effects. We use a novel collection of simulations to assess the range of
   different outcomes for the West Africa monsoon based on this uncertainty
   in the effects of aerosol pollution. We show that simulations in which
   the atmosphere has a weak response to aerosol pollution do not reproduce
   the observed drying trend over West Africa, while simulations with a
   stronger atmospheric response to pollution feature a larger drought.
   This uncertainty in the effects of aerosol pollution leads to uncertain
   changes in the West African monsoon winds and rainfall and in extremes
   of rainfall and temperature.},

Pages = {9-26},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Given the significant differences in spatial and temporal distribution
   of rainfall, prolonged periods of water stress, problematic soils and
   absence of perennial rivers, the Northeastern interior is the region
   most vulnerable to climate change in Brazil. Based on analysis of
   climate data, this study aims to identify trends in sea surface
   temperatures in the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, East Pacific and
   Central Pacific Oceans and their relation with the temporal variability
   in precipitation in Pernambuco in recent periods. Three methods were
   used to achieve the proposed objective. The Rain Anomaly Index was used
   as evidence of the relationship between the oceans and rainfall in NEB.
   Research trends in TSM's the Mann-Kendall method. To demonstrate changes
   in current precipitation, climate indices suggested by the Expert Team
   on Detection, Monitoring and Climate Change Indices were used. The
   climate change indices indicated that changes in rainfall patterns have
   been occurring, with a tendency toward an increase in the volume of rain
   (with the exception of the eastern coast) and more concentrated seasonal
   distributions. Statistical analysis of TSM's on the Pacific and Atlantic
   allowed us to observe that there is a warming trend and that when
   analyzed alone, the occurrence of positive anomalies over the eastern
   Pacific (El Nino) and negative anomalies over the South Atlantic
   (positive dipole), droughts are more severe, based on analysis of the
   rainfall anomaly index. Also based on the IAC, we concluded that when
   both events occur in isolation they exert influence on rainfall in the
   region, however, when they act together this influence is more
   pronounced, changing the behavior of the general circulation of the
   atmosphere meridionaly (Hadley cell) and zonally (Walker cell).},

Title = {Trends in Quality Controlled Precipitation Indicators in the United
   States Midwest and Great Lakes Region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Changes in precipitation can have broad and significant societal
   impacts. A number of previous studies that analyzed changes in
   precipitation across the Great Lakes and Midwest for a variety of time
   periods and using a range of quality-control standards and methods
   observed increased precipitation rates and totals, although there was
   considerable site-to-site variability, even for sites in close physical
   proximity. Biases and discontinuities in precipitation observations may
   contribute to this variability. This study identifies and examines
   changes in precipitation utilizing a unique approach to observation
   series screening over a region encompassing the Great Lakes and broader
   Midwestern region of the United States for the period 1951-2019. A
   multiple tier procedure was utilized to identify high quality input data
   series from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset.
   Annual and seasonal time series of precipitation indicators were
   calculated and subjected to breakpoint analysis as further quality
   control. Trends were analyzed across a broad range of related
   indicators, from totals and frequencies of threshold events to event
   duration and potential linkages with total precipitable water. Results
   indicate that annual precipitation has generally increased across the
   region in terms of totals, although there is substantial variation
   across the study domain in the significance and magnitude of annual
   trends by indicator. Annual trends were spatially most consistent across
   eastern areas of the study domain while relatively greater
   station-to-station variability in trend significance and magnitude was
   observed across northern and western portions. Significant trends were
   generally fewer in number for seasonal precipitation indicators and less
   spatially coherent. The greatest number of significant trends occurred
   in fall with the fewest in spring. Correlation of indicator trends with
   trends of mean total precipitable water suggests weak correlations
   annually and moderate correlations at the seasonal scale. The trends of
   the precipitation indicators in our study exhibited more coherent
   spatial patterns when compared with studies with different quality
   control criteria, illustrating the importance of quality control of
   observations in climatic studies and highlighting the complexity of the
   changing character of precipitation.},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of precipitation trace mechanisms of hydroclimatic
   change in the modern and paleoclimate record. Patterns and drivers of
   isotopic change at multidecadal timescales have remained unclear,
   however, due to limitations in the observational record. Here, we use a
   65-year global data compilation to estimate solstial season delta
   O-18(p) trends. Spatially organized regions of change suggest divergent
   controls, and we propose that changes in atmospheric water balance
   dominate trends in moisture-limited areas, whereas changes in upwind
   source region conditions drive trends where atmospheric water flux is
   large relative to precipitation. Positive trends on windward coasts
   suggest the latter effect, whereas we attribute the dipole patterns in
   trends over North America and Europe and decreasing trends in southern
   Australia during boreal winter to the former. Simulations from the
   isotope-enabled Community Atmospheric Model match predictions for water
   balance, implying that the model may underrepresent the effects of
   changing vapor source conditions.},

Year = {1995},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {713-720},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Water consumption figures for the southwest United States are compared
   for the last four decades. Past trends in consumption are evaluated in
   the context of precipitation variability in the region and with regard
   to Colorado River streamflow changes. The study represents a follow-up
   look at a previous assessment of water consumption, regional
   precipitation, and demographic trends in Arizona, California, Colorado,
   Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah, which account for much of the annual
   depletions of Colorado River water. The previous study was completed
   during a wet spell in the West, and trends in all major categories of
   water consumption were consistently upward. This study indicates that a
   decline or reversal has taken place in water use in many of the western
   states. The greater water efficiency (reduced per capita water use) is
   particularly noteworthy in California, which alone accounts for the
   lion's share of water depletions from the Colorado River Basin. The
   years since the mid-1980's have been predominantly dry in much of the
   West. At the same time, population in the six-state region has increased
   at about the same pace it had grown during prior decades. A shift from
   irrigation-related uses to civil consumption is evident in the 1980's.
   Taking into consideration a situation where multiyear dry spells are a
   normal part of the climate of the region, it appears that irrigation
   depletions may have peaked in the West. In the future, allocations for
   civil supply, recreation, and other in-stream uses as well as for
   hydropower generation may heighten the competition for available water
   supplies, put pressure on existing pricing policies, and force users
   toward greater conservation efforts and improved efficiencies.},

Title = {Trends in Different Grades of Precipitation over the Yangtze River Basin
   from 1960 to 2017},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Under the background of global warming, the trends and variabilities of
   different grades of precipitation have significant effects on the
   management of regional ecosystems and water resources. Based on a daily
   precipitation dataset collected from 148 meteorological stations in the
   Yangtze River Basin from 1960 to 2017, precipitation events were divided
   into four grades (small, moderate, large, and heavy precipitation
   events) according to the precipitation intensity to analyze the temporal
   and spatial change trends of different grades of precipitation amounts
   and frequencies, and the influence of different grades of precipitation
   on total precipitation was also discussed in this study. The results
   revealed that small precipitation amounts over the Yangtze River Basin
   decreased significantly, with a rate of -1.22\%/10a, while heavy
   precipitation amounts showed a significant increasing trend (4.27\%/10a)
   during the study period. The precipitation frequency of small and total
   events decreased significantly, with rates of -3.86\%/10a and
   -2.97\%/10a, respectively. Regionally, from the upper reaches to the
   lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin, the contribution rate of small
   precipitation amounts and frequencies to the total precipitation
   gradually decreased, while heavy precipitation amounts and frequencies
   increased. The different grades of precipitation in region II showed a
   decreasing trend due to its unique geographical features. Furthermore, a
   Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the response of
   precipitation to long-term air temperature, demonstrating that small and
   moderate precipitation amounts and frequencies were mainly negatively
   correlated with long-term air temperature and that heavy precipitation
   amounts showed a stronger positive correlation with long-term air
   temperature (13.35\%/K). Based on this, the rate of change in heavy
   precipitation in the Yangtze River Basin may be higher under the
   background of climate warming, which will lead to greater risks of
   extreme floods in the future. Evaluating and predicting the trends of
   different grades can provide a theoretical reference for agricultural
   production, flood control, and drought mitigation.},

Abstract = {Precipitation and reference evapotranspiration are key parameters in
   hydro-meteorological studies and used for agricultural planning,
   irrigation system design and management. Precipitation and evaporative
   demand are expected to be alter under climate change and affect the
   sustainable development. In this article, spatial variability and
   temporal trend of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
   were investigated over Narmada river basin (India), a humid tropical
   climatic region. In the present study, 12 and 28 observatory stations
   were selected for precipitation and ETo, respectively of 102-years
   period (1901-2002). A rigorous analysis for trend detection was carried
   out using non parametric tests such as Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman
   Rho (SR). Sen's slope estimator was used to analyze the rate of change
   in long term series. Moreover, all the stations of basin exhibit
   positive trend for annual ETo, while 8\% stations indicate significant
   negative trend for mean annual precipitation, respectively. Change
   points of annual precipitation were identified around the year 1962
   applying Buishand's and Pettit's test. Annual mean precipitation reduced
   by 9\% in upper part while increased maximum by 5\% in lower part of the
   basin due temporal changes. Although annual mean ETo increase by 4-12\%
   in most of the region. Moreover, results of the study are very helpful
   in planning and development of agricultural water resources.},

Abstract = {This study provides the first long-term assessment of changes in
   precipitation associated with different rainfall categories over the
   Iberian Peninsula (IP). Using recently digitized data from 27 stations
   in Portugal and Spain, we have examined trends of precipitation indices
   for the complete period 1903-2003 and the two subperiods 1903-1953 and
   1954-2003. These indices were evaluated seasonally according to five
   rainfall categories: total rainfall (>= 0.2 mm), light rainfall (>= 0.2
   and < 2.5 mm), moderate rainfall (>= 2.5 and <7.5 mm), intense rainfall
   (>= 7.5 mm), and very intense rainfall (>= 15 mm). For the complete
   period 1903-2003, we have found that the total number of rainy days and
   that of light rainfall are increasing at many observatories over the IP
   for all seasons (except in the western zone of Portugal and the Cadiz
   gulf, where they are decreasing). Both subperiods show opposite
   behaviors in fall and spring. During the first (second) subperiod
   spanning 1903-1953 (1954-2003), we can find a generalized decrease
   (increase) in the number of rainy days in fall in all rainfall
   categories. In spring, an increase in the number of rainy days is found
   mainly for total, moderate, and intense categories for the first
   subperiod, and a slight decrease during the second. In winter, we have
   verified a decrease in the number of rainy days mainly for total,
   moderate, and intense rainfall categories in the second subperiod.
   Finally in relation to the maximum length of dry spells for both
   subperiods, most observatories show significant trends opposite those of
   the total number of rainy days. It is worth noticing that the
   contrasting evolution of trends found between the first and second
   halves of the twentieth century could only be characterized in this work
   following a recent comprehensive digitization of historical Iberian
   precipitation data from the first decades of the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Drought is one of the most destructive natural disasters, which become
   more extreme and less predictable due to climate change. Drought
   directly affects a region's water resources, leading to inadequate water
   availability and harming crops, animals, and humans. The objective of
   the present study is to assess the long-term trends of precipitation and
   drought characteristics for the Churu district of N-E Rajasthan, India.
   For this purpose, mean monthly precipitation data are collected through
   the India-WRIS from 1901 to 2022. The trend analysis uses statistical
   methods (M-K test \& amp; SS estimator), and the results are compared
   with the graphical method (innovative trend analysis). Drought events
   are found using precipitation-based drought indices, i.e., standardized
   precipitation index, Z-score index, and percentage of normal
   precipitation index. Interestingly, the results of the statistical
   method are well matched with the results of the graphical method. The
   study concludes that during the annual precipitation rising trend is
   observed, which can help to mitigate the severity of drought. Also, it
   is found that moderately dry droughts occur most frequently compared to
   other drought events. This study will help policy-makers and local
   administrators to take necessary action to mitigate the severity of
   drought.},

Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Adequate water resources management includes understanding patterns and
   spatiotemporal variability of precipitation, as this variable is
   determinant for ecosystems' stability, food security, and most human
   activities. Based on satellite estimations validated through ground
   measurements from 59 meteorological stations, the objective of this
   study is to evaluate the long-term spatiotemporal variability and trends
   of the average monthly precipitation in the Magdalena Department,
   Colombia, for the 1981-2018 period. This heterogeneous region comprises
   many different ecoregions in its 23,188 km(2) area. The analysis of
   spatial variability allowed for the determination of four different
   subregions based on the differences in the average values of
   precipitation and the degree of rainfall variability. The trend analysis
   indicates that the current rainfall patterns contradict previous
   estimates of a progressive decrease in annual averages due to climate
   change in the study region, as most of the department does not exhibit
   statistically significant trends, except for the Sierra Nevada de Santa
   Marta area, where this study found reductions between 10 mm yr(-1) and
   30 mm yr(-1). The findings of this study also suggest the existence of
   some links between precipitation patterns with regional phenomena of
   climate variability and solar activity.},

Abstract = {Meteorological drought during the southwest monsoon season and for the
   northeast monsoon season over five meteorological subdivisions of India
   for the period 1901-2015 has been examined using district and all India
   standardized precipitation index (SPI). Whenever all India southwest
   monsoon rainfall was less than -10\% or below normal, for those years
   all India SPI was found as -1 or less. Composite analysis of SPI for the
   below normal years, viz., less than -15\% and -20\% of normal rainfall
   years indicate that during those years more than 30\% of country's area
   was under drought condition, whenever all India southwest monsoon
   rainfall was -15\% or less than normal. Trend analysis of monthly SPI
   for the monsoon months identified the districts experiencing significant
   increase in drought occurrences. Significant positive correlation has
   been found with the meteorological drought over most of the districts of
   central, northern and peninsular India, while negative correlation was
   seen over the districts of eastern India with NINO 3.4 SST. For the
   first time, meteorological drought analysis over districts and its
   association with equatorial pacific SST and probability analysis has
   been done for the northeast monsoon over the affected regions of south
   peninsular India. Temporal correlation of all India southwest monsoon
   SPI and south peninsular India northeast monsoon SPI has been done with
   the global SST to identify the teleconnection of drought in India with
   global parameters.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Study region: Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia Study focus: This
   study aims to determine possible trends in monthly, seasonal and annual
   precipitation and streamflow series. The Discrete Wavelet Transform
   (DWT) was used to obtain detailed information about the time-frequency
   conditions of six meteorological and five streamflow stations during
   1984-2014. The Mann-Kendall test was also applied to the original and
   the DWT components to determine which periodicities are dominant in
   reproducing the observed trends. The combined DWT and Mann-Kendall test
   has not been explored in the UBNRB context. We used three criteria to
   determine a suitable wavelet, decomposition level, and signal extension
   mode. From these criteria, the bias ratio between the wavelet
   approximation series and the original time series was proposed and
   explored in this study.New hydrological insights for the region: Results
   show that almost all the precipitation stations experience an
   insignificant but increasing trend, whereas the streamflow stations
   exhibit an increasing trend at a 5\% significance level. The combined
   use of DWT and the Mann-Kendall test show that periodic events up to 4
   years are more influential in affecting the observed trends.},

Title = {Explaining recent trends in extreme precipitation in the Southwestern
   Alps by changes in atmospheric influences},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article analyzes recent trends in extreme precipitation in the
   Southwestern Alps and compares these trends to changes in the occurrence
   of the atmospheric influences generating extremes. We consider a
   highresolution precipitation dataset of 1 x 1 km(2) for the period
   1958-2017. A robust method of trend estimation in extreme precipitation
   is considered, based on nonstationary extreme value distribution and a
   homogeneous neighborhood approach. The results show contrasting trends
   in extreme precipitation depending on the season. In autumn, most of
   Southern France shows significant increasing trends, with increase in
   the 20-year return level between 1958 and 2017 as large as its average
   value over the period, while the Northern French Alps and the Swiss
   Valais show decreasing extremes. In winter, significant increasing
   extremes are found in the valleys and medium mountain areas surrounding
   the Northern French Alps, while the inner French Alps, the Swiss Valais
   and the Aosta Valley show significant decreasing trends. In the other
   seasons, the significant trends are mostly negative in the Mediterranean
   area. Comparing these trends to changes in the occurrence of the
   atmospheric influences generating extremes shows that part of the
   significant changes in extremes can be explained by changes in the
   dominant influences, in particular in the Mediterranean influenced
   region that shows the most organized trends. In particular, the strong
   positive trends in extreme precipitation in autumn in Southern France
   are concomitant with an increase in Mediterranean influence generating
   extremes.},

Title = {Distinct Holocene precipitation trends over arid Central Asia and
   linkages to westerlies and Asian monsoon},
Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {266},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The response of precipitation over arid Central Asia since the mid
   Holocene is long considered to be controlled by astronomical
   insolation-induced changes in the westerlies. However, it is still
   controversial in proxy and modeling studies whether the trend of Central
   Asian precipitation is in accordance with Asian monsoon or not. Compared
   to the monsoon, the westerlies-associated precipitation changes are
   complicated and also rely on regional mountain complex. In this study,
   we conducted a high-resolution transient experiment by a coupled climate
   model to evaluate the response of Central Asian precipitation. The
   simulated precipitation changes are distinctly different over regions
   although they are mainly associated with the westerlies. Since mid
   Holocene, the annual precipitation increases over BalkhashAltai region
   but decreases over Turan Plain, Mongolia-Baikal and Tarim Basin, in all
   of which the summer precipitation contributes most. Following the summer
   insolation, the southward shift of westerly jet is accompanied by
   wave-like anomalies in the upper-tropospheric meridional winds across
   mid-latitude Eurasia (the Silk Road pattern), which results in distinct
   summer precipitation changes. The decreased precipitation over Tarim is
   mainly explained by weakened low-level easterly wind anomaly and less
   moisture supply from East Asia. In contrast, the responses of winter
   precipitation are limited even in the winter-rainfall-dominated regime
   due to the small insolation change. Such simulated complicated
   precipitation trends during the Holocene are in qualitative agreement
   with existing proxies, highlighting the modulation of Silk Road pattern
   on Central Asian rainfall on the orbital timescale. (C) 2021 Elsevier

   1955-2011 and for the three sections of the catchment, Upper, Middle and
   Lower as defined by the location of the gauging stations at Yichang,
   Hankou and Datong respectively. Mean annual temperature increases
   downstream from 12.7 degrees C in the Upper to 16.0 degrees C in the
   Lower section. A significant increasing trend in mean annual temperature
   is detected over the period 1955-2011 in the whole catchment and all
   subsections. Mean annual precipitation for the whole catchment is 1045
   mm ranging from 859 mm in the elevated Upper section to 1528 mm in the
   Lower section. Precipitation variability is low by world standards with
   an annual Cv of 0.066. Using the Mann-Kendal and Rank Sums tests we do
   not find any trend in precipitation in the catchment. Mean annual runoff
   for the whole catchment is 515 mm ranging from 421 mm in the Upper
   Catchment to 838 mm in the Lower Catchment. Runoff variability is also
   low by world standards with an annual runoff Cv of 0.129. For the Middle
   Catchment we find a small but statistically significant increase in
   runoff and the runoff ratio over the period 1955-2011, possibly caused
   by change in the nature of the surface due to accelerated urbanization
   post 1980 and increased area of water storage. Overall, annual runoff in
   the Yangtze River shows little response to the major changes occurring
   in the basin. In a multiple correlation analysis of discharge,
   precipitation, dam volume, population and GDP, only precipitation is
   significantly correlated with discharge, explaining 80\% of the
   variance. Widespread reporting of the impact of development on the
   annual water yield of the Yangtze, especially the impact of dams and
   notably the Three Gorges Dam, are not supported by this analysis. (C)

Abstract = {This study is an attempt to determine the trends in monthly, annual and

   regression, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and discrete wavelet transform

   (1851-2006) to detect changes. The sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test
   was applied to identify the temporal variation in trend. Wavelet
   transform is a relatively new tool for trend analysis in hydrology.
   Comparison studies were carried out between decomposed series by DWT and
   original series. Furthermore, visualization of extreme and contributing
   events was carried out using the wavelet spectrum at different threshold
   values. The results showed that there are significant positive trends
   for annual and monsoon precipitation series in North Mountainous India
   (zone NMI) and North East India (NEI), whereas negative trends were
   detected when considering India as whole.},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {Based on a precipitation time series from 49 meteorological stations in
   Sichuan Province during the period from 1961 to 2011, the multi-scale
   characteristics of precipitation variability are analyzed using the
   extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition method (ESMD). Regional
   differences in variation trends and change-points were also
   preliminarily discussed. The results indicated that in the last 50+
   years, the overall precipitation in Sichuan Province has exhibited a
   significant non-linear downward trend, and its changes have clearly
   exhibited an inter-annual scale (quasi-3 and quasi-8-year) and
   interdecadal scale (quasi-13-year). The variance contribution rates of
   each component demonstrated that the inter-annual change had a strong
   influence on the overall precipitation change in Sichuan Province, and
   the reconstructed inter-annual variation trend could describe the
   fluctuation state of the original precipitation during the study period.
   The reconstructed interdecadal variability revealed that the climate
   mode in Sichuan Province had divided into three distinct variation
   periods with 1973 and 1998 as the boundaries. Furthermore, there were
   regional differences in the non-linear changes and change-points of
   precipitation. In addition, in order to study the relations between the
   changing more or less of rising or decrease and meteorological station's
   geographical position (latitude, longitude and elevation) i.e., the
   Cokriging interpolation technique is applied directly to precipitation
   variation trend components through ESMD decomposition. At the same time,
   the results also suggested that the ESMD method can effectively reveal
   variations in long-term precipitation sequences at different time scales
   and can be used for the complex diagnosis of non-linear and
   non-stationary signal changes.},

Abstract = {Daily precipitation data of 741 meteorological stations ranging from
   1956 to 2005 were used to run a preliminary investigation of changes in
   temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation intensity and
   frequency in ten hydrological regions in China. Average annual and
   seasonal spatial values of indices of precipitation characteristics
   (i.e. precipitation amount, intensity and frequency) were obtained using
   a Kriging interpolation method. Temporal tendencies were calculated by
   Mann-Kendall's method. The trends of extreme rainfall events and
   precipitation-based droughts were also discussed in ten hydrological
   regions using the maximum daily precipitation and dry spell duration in
   a year. Results show that precipitation intensity has significant
   increasing trends while precipitation frequency has significant
   decreasing trends over China. Meanwhile precipitation has a major
   decline in autumn and a slight increase in winter. Both extreme rainfall
   events and precipitation-based droughts show a general increasing trend.
   The aggravated spatial and temporal unevenly distributed precipitation
   leads to more water shortage as well as floods in China. (C) 2014

Abstract = {The variability in seasonal mean and extreme precipitation is analyzed
   for several regions of Argentina to the north of 39 degrees S, using
   long-term monthly time series data which expand from 1860 to 2006. The
   selected locations can be considered as representative of different
   climatic regions. This work focuses on the analysis of monthly rainfall
   distribution, significant seasonal trends, changes in variance and
   extreme monthly values, in order to establish the magnitude of the
   seasonal climatic rainfall variability through time for central
   Argentina. A 40-yr moving window was employed in order to analyze
   seasonal variability of rainfall extremes. Extremes were computed for
   different probability levels of a theoretical distribution function
   over/below the 80th/20th percentile. The gamma distribution was selected
   among five other theoretical distributions, and the scale and shape
   parameters were computed using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
   and the bootstrap method for 1000 resample data sets, as well. Trend
   analysis was performed for each window on winter and summer means and
   tested for significance. The use of a moving window allowed detecting
   the window of maximum absolute values for the trends. Research results
   show significant temporal shifts in seasonal rainfall distribution and
   return values (RV) that were computed for different frequencies (once
   every five, 10 and 20 years). Generally, summer precipitation extremes
   have become wetter for the whole region. Rainfall amounts for summer
   wet/dry extremes (W/D) corresponding to the 90th (for W) and 10th (for
   D) percentiles were subjected to significant increase, but depending on
   the geographical area this effect spreads slightly differently over
   records of years. A common-for-all-stations period of such summer
   increase trend in extreme values spans from the window 1921-1960 to the
   last window analyzed: 1967-2006. This behavior was not observed for
   north and west Argentina during winter, except for the region
   represented by Bahia Blanca, where the 10\% D extreme has increased
   throughout the study period.},

Title = {Application of new precipitation and reconstructed streamflow products

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {21},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1807-1828},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {River runoff to the Arctic Ocean has increased over the last century,
   primarily during the winter and spring and primarily from the major
   Eurasian rivers. Some recent studies have suggested that the additional
   runoff is due to increased northward transport of atmospheric moisture
   (and associated increased precipitation), but other studies show
   inconsistencies in long-term runoff and precipitation trends, perhaps
   partly due to biases in the observational datasets. Through trend
   analysis of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow data, the authors
   investigate the extent to which Eurasian Arctic river discharge changes
   are attributable to precipitation and temperature changes as well as to
   reservoir construction and operation between the years of 1936 and 2000.
   Two new datasets are applied: a gridded precipitation product, in which
   the low-frequency variability is constrained to match that of long-term
   bias-corrected precipitation station data, and a reconstructed
   streamflow product, in which the effects of reservoirs have been
   minimized using a physically based reservoir model. It is found that
   reservoir operations have primarily affected streamflow seasonality,
   increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge. To
   understand the influences of climate on streamflow changes, the authors
   hypothesize three cases that would cause precipitation trends to be
   inconsistent with streamflow trends: first, for the coldest basins in
   northeastern Siberia, streamflow should be sensitive to warming
   primarily as a result of the melting of excess ground ice, and for these
   basins positive streamflow trends may exceed precipitation trends in
   magnitude; second, evapotranspiration (ET) in the warmer regions of
   western Siberia and European Russia is sensitive to warming and
   increased precipitation, therefore observed precipitation trends may
   exceed streamflow trends; and third, streamflow from the central
   Siberian basins should respond to both effects. It is found that, in
   general, these hypotheses hold true. In the coldest basins, streamflow
   trends diverged from precipitation trends starting in the 1950s to
   1960s, and this divergence accelerated thereafter. In the warmest
   basins, precipitation trends consistently exceeded streamflow trends,
   suggesting that increased precipitation contributed to increases in both
   ET and streamflow. In the central basins, permafrost degradation and ET
   effects appear to be contributing to long-term streamflow trends in
   varying degrees for each basin. The results herein suggest that the
   extent and state of the permafrost underlying a basin is a complicating
   factor in understanding long-term changes in Eurasian Arctic river
   discharge.},

Abstract = {In this study, extreme rainfall indices of Olimpiyat Station were
   determined from reference period (1971-2000) and future period
   (2070-2099) daily rainfall data projected using the HadGEM2-ES and
   GFDL-ESM2M global circulation models (GCMs) and downscaled by the
   RegCM4.3.4 regional model under the Representative Concentration Pathway
   RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend statistics was
   used to detect trends in the indices of each group, and the
   nonparametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test was employed to identify the
   presence of differences among the values of the rainfall indices of the
   three groups. Moreover, the peaks-over-threshold (POT) method was used
   to undertake frequency analysis and estimate the maximum 24-h rainfall
   values of various return periods. The results of the M-K-based trend
   analyses showed that there are insignificant increasing trends in most
   of the extreme rainfall indices. However, based on the Wilcoxon signed
   ranks test, the values of the extreme rainfall indices determined for
   the future period, particularly under RCP8.5, were found to be
   significantly different from the corresponding values determined for the
   reference period. The maximum 24-h rainfall amounts of the 50-year
   return period of the future period under RCP4.5 of the HadGEM2-ES and
   GFDL-ESM2M GCMs were found to be larger (by 5.85\%) than the
   corresponding value of the reference period by 5.85 and 21.43\%,
   respectively. The results also showed that the maximum 24-h rainfall
   amount under RCP8.5 of both the HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M GCMs was found
   to be greater (34.33 and 12.18\%, respectively, for the 50-year return
   period) than the reference period values. This may increase the risk of
   flooding in Ayamama Watershed, and thus, studying the effects of the
   predicted amount of rainfall under the RCP8.5 scenario on the flooding
   risk of Ayamama Watershed and devising management strategies are
   recommended to enhance the design and implementation of adaptation
   measures.},

Abstract = {Examining historical variations of hydroclimatic variables can provide
   crucial information about changes of water resources in a water cycle.
   In this study, the Mann-Kendall (MK) and Innovative Polygon Trend
   Analysis (IPTA) methods were applied to 56-year precipitation data
   collected at 8 measuring stations. These stations are located in Eastern
   Black Sea Basin (EBSB), which has a significant amount of annual
   precipitation and hydroelectric potential in Turkey. This study has two
   objectives: (1) investigating possible changes in the monthly
   precipitation and (2) comparing the results achieved by a classical (MK)
   and one of the latest trend analysis methods presented in the literature
   (IPTA). Based on the results, MK achieved no trend for most of months,
   while it reached an increasing trend for March at most of the stations.
   Likewise, IPTA determined an increasing trend for March precipitation.
   However, an increasing/decreasing trend was obtained by IPTA for most of
   the months and stations. In other words, comparing the trend analysis
   results obtained by IPTA and MK indicates a significant discrepancy
   between the numbers of months with detected trends primarily because the
   former is relatively more sensitive in trend identification. To be more
   precise, IPTA and MK determined trends in approximately 81.25\% and
   12.5\% of all months, respectively. Furthermore, the former identified
   quite the same trends in every month which the latter reported a trend.
   Moreover, the polygon of the mean and standard deviation graphs
   developed by IPTA provides a year cycle, which brings about useful
   information for water utility sectors and decision makers of the study
   area. Finally, the findings of this study contribute to a large amount
   of research that attempts to explore spatio-temporal variations of
   hydroclimatic variables around the globe not only to enhance humans'
   knowledge about changes in a water cycle but also assess climate change
   impacts.},

Abstract = {Variations in long-term precipitation trends due to climate forcings
   have been observed in many parts of the world, exacerbating hydrological
   uncertainties to predicting droughts, floods, water resource
   availability, and ecosystem services. The Lower Mississippi River
   Alluvial Valley (LMRAV) is an important economic region of the midsouth
   USA, which is prone to natural disasters from extreme climate events and
   is known historically for cyclic flooding events and, within the last 20
   years, for groundwater level declines. However, our knowledge of
   long-term precipitation trends in this region is fragmented. Using
   100-year historic daily precipitation data from six stations of forest
   lands along with multivariate statistical analysis, we found that there
   were significant increasing trends (p <= 0.05) in annual precipitation
   near the south coastal area of the LMRAV and only marginally increasing
   trends in the northern area. Spatial variation in seasonality was
   observed at the decadal scale with increasing trends in fall near the
   coastal area and in spring around the north area. In addition to
   becoming wetter, the coastal area also experienced higher precipitation
   intensity with shorter return period over the past 100 years. These
   findings are useful to water resource managers for adapting to changing
   climate conditions in the LMRAV.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {The preceding and succeeding precipitation (P-S-P) of a precipitation
   extreme often contribute to flooding initiated by the extreme event
   itself. In this study, the concept of event-based extreme precipitation
   (EEP), defined as a precipitation event (daily precipitation >= 1 mm for
   successive days) having at least one daily precipitation extreme (daily
   precipitation a the 99th percentile), is proposed to consider P-S-P of
   daily extreme precipitation. Further, the time distribution patterns,
   trends, and return levels of EEPs across China are analyzed based on a
   0.5 x 0.5 degrees gridded precipitation dataset covering 1961-2016. The
   data demonstrate the EEP concept, that multi day EEP with daily extreme
   precipitation occurring late in the event is predominant in China except
   for the Northwest where single-day EEP prevails. Over west China, EEP is
   increasing and becomes more temporally concentrated. In the lower
   Lantsang River, along the southeast coastline and on the Hainan Island,
   the 20- and 50-yr return levels of EEP would exceed 300 and 400 mm,
   respectively. Moreover, global warming possibly induces more single-day
   EEPs in the Northwest. The EEP concept may help guide attempts to manage
   extreme precipitation on event basis, which is particularly useful for
   regions characterized by long-lasting extreme precipitation.},

   precipitation over the contiguous United States},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Historical and projected trends in extreme precipitation events are
   examined in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models and
   observations, over the contiguous United States (CONUS), using several
   approaches. This study updates earlier studies that have used the
   extreme precipitation index (EPI) to assess observations and goes
   further by using the EPI to evaluate available climate model
   simulations. An increasing trend over the CONUS was found in the EPI,
   with large differences among seven subregions of the United States.
   Median of CMIP5 simulations also finds an increasing trend in the EPI,
   but with a smaller magnitude than the observations. Model spread is
   large and in most cases bigger than the model signal itself.
   Statistically significant (95th confidence level) increasing trends in
   the observational-based EPI occur over the Midwest and Eastern regions,
   while most decreasing trends occur over Western regions. Some models
   give negative correlation coefficients relative to observations.
   However, some ensemble members, for most models, show correlation
   coefficients greater than 0.5. Projections of extreme precipitation
   event frequency, for representative concentration pathway (RCP)
   scenarios 4.5 and 8.5, show increasing trends over the CONUS. Both
   scenarios give a steady increase throughout the period but the RCP 4.5
   signal is smaller in magnitude. Overall, the RCP scenarios show an
   increase across all regions with the exception of some variability
   between decades in some regions for RCP 4.5. For the CONUS model spread
   is smaller than the projected signal. Regional analyses show overall
   agreement among models of a future increase in extreme precipitation
   event frequency over most regions.},

Abstract = {Assessing the spatial and temporal variability of climate data is one of
   the basic requirements for solving water and water management problems.
   This study performed a comprehensive data quality test, a precipitation
   concentration index (PCI), Sen's slope, Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test,
   and an analysis of the symptoms of drought using rainfall anomaly index
   (RAI) and standardized precipitation index (SPI). The standard
   homogeneity test (SNHT), Pettitt test, Buishand range test, and von
   Neumann scale were used for homogeneity analysis, and most tehsils
   (administrative boundary) showed the same weather character. PCI annual
   estimates show high local and temporary variability or irregularity in
   rainfall distribution. MK tests showed a marked increase in the tendency
   to high temperatures; however, the trend of annual and extreme rain
   events was not significant for most of the stations. The extreme dry
   conditions in 101 years (IMD) were found at Sujangarh. Analysis of size
   statistics and the trend of rainfall anomaly indices and spatial
   variability of climate data are important in the integration of water
   resource planning and management decisions. Rajasthan is an agricultural
   state in India, the monsoon rainfall largely controls the production of
   crops, and the proper implementation of regional agro-water management
   and rainwater harvesting can contribute significantly to agricultural
   potential. This study paves the way for further exploration of
   inter-regional hydrological modeling to sustain livelihoods. The mean
   yearly precipitation has shown a minimal non-significant positive
   pattern over the dryland ecosystem. Amazingly, 3 year running average
   has shown a cyclic example of mean yearly precipitation under the
   changing climatic conditions and in dry and wet conditions at different
   time scales. The western, northern, and southern parts of the dryland
   ecosystem have encountered wetter conditions (significant at 95\%
   certainty level), while north-eastern, eastern, and south-eastern
   regions have seen expanded drier circumstances. Overall, most of the
   areas are suffering from hyperarid conditions, which needs extreme water
   management for a below normal-to-normal arid cropping.},

   stations, with three stations showing enhanced rainfall (total of 100
   mm/month over the entire time interval) and two stations a decrease in
   rainfall with time (total of 150 mryVmonth). In addition, one station
   experienced a decrease of both First and Second Intermonsoon rainfall
   over time (total of 80 mm/month). The stations showing loss of rainfall
   are confined to higher elevation areas and those exhibiting enhanced
   rainfall are located in the lowlands in the southwestern sector of Sri
   Lanka. None of the stations show any significant change in Northeast
   Monsoon precipitation through time. Most of the stations are shown to

Title = {Extreme precipitation trends in Northeast China based on a
   non-stationary generalized extreme value model},

Abstract = {Northeast China is the main food production base of China. Extreme
   precipitation (EP) events can seriously impact agricultural production
   and socioeconomics, but the understanding of EP in Northeast China is
   still limited. In this study, using the non-stationary generalized
   extreme value (GEV) model, we investigate the trend and potential risk
   of EP in Northeast China during 1959-2017, especially in early and
   mid-summer (periods of high frequency of EP). Then, the relationships
   between EP and large-scale circulation over Northeast China in early and
   mid-summer are analyzed separately. The EP in Northeast China mainly
   presents positive trends in early summer but negative trends in
   mid-summer. Meanwhile, the EP with all the return periods presents
   apparently increasing trends in early summer, corresponding to more
   frequent EP events. Nevertheless, in mid-summer, the EP with 2-year
   return period decreases with location parameter, and the EP with
   20-year, 50-year, and 100-year return periods slightly increases with
   scale parameter. The EP with 2-year return period occurs frequently in
   Liaoning Province, while the EP with 100-year return period is more
   likely to occur in Jilin Province and Heilongjiang Province. Moreover,
   the increase of the EP in early summer is mainly influenced by the
   northeast cold vortex; the effect of cold air on the EP is stronger in
   mid-summer, giving a clear explanation why the EP in mid-summer does not
   increase significantly. Overall, the outcomes of this study would be
   beneficial for the disaster prevention and mitigation in Northeast
   China.},

Title = {Interdecadal Shift in Dipole Pattern Precipitation Trends Over the
   Tibetan Plateau: Roles of Local Vortices},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Trends of precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are characterized
   by a north-south dipole pattern, and the role of local mesoscale
   systems, TP vortices (TPVs), remains ambiguous. This work reports that
   the north-south dipole pattern trends in the TPVs-associated
   precipitation have experienced an interdecadal shift in the last two
   decades, that is, increases in northern TP and decreases in southern TP
   first and then varies opposite trends, which greatly contributes to the
   similar interdecadal shift in TP precipitation trends. Furthermore, the
   causes of changes in TPV frequency are explored from the perspective of
   lower troposphere conditions. We find that the lower-level winds, that
   is, zonal winds over the TP and meridional winds across the northwestern
   TP boundary, are responsible for the regionally different variations in
   TPV frequency. The variations in Indian Ocean Dipole are suggested to
   contribute to the changes in lower-level winds over the TP.
   Precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) significantly affect local
   and downstream water resources, which generally presents dipole pattern
   trends, that is, opposite precipitation trends in the northern TP (NTP)
   and in southern TP (STP). However, the physical processes of the
   variations in TP precipitation, especially the roles of local mesoscale
   systems, TP vortices (TPVs), are not yet clear. In this work, dipole
   pattern variations are found in TPVs-associated precipitation, which
   experienced an interdecadal shift in the last two decades, that is,
   increases in NTP and decreases in STP first and then varies opposite
   trends. The interdecadal shift in the TPVs-associated precipitation
   trends greatly contributes to the interdecadal shift in the TP
   precipitation trends. Furthermore, the causes of variations in TPV
   frequency are explored, and find that the changes in zonal winds over
   the TP and meridional winds across the northwestern TP boundary are
   closely related to the regionally different variations in TPV frequency.
   Subsequently, the changes in the sea surface temperature of India Ocean
   are demonstrated to be responsible for the wind variations.},

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {217-237},
Abstract = {Seasonal trends in extreme precipitation indices were investigated for
   30 yr moving periods between December 1950 and February 2008. To update
   the 2008 to 2015 data, supplementary calculations were performed for >
   120 meteorological stations. A linear regression of the least squares
   method was used to calculate trend magnitudes. Trend significance was
   tested using the Mann-Kendall method. Changes in short-term trend
   frequency and temporal coherence were assessed. Extreme precipitation
   was defined as a daily amount exceeding the 95th percentile, calculated
   separately for each month and station using daily totals >= 1 mm. The
   spatial pattern of extreme precipitation trends varied by season.
   Significant extreme precipitation trends were rare, constituting
   approximately 25 to 30\% of all analysed trends, and were seldom
   temporally coherent. Most of these significant trends were upward,
   except in summer, when a nearly equal frequency of positive and negative
   trends was found. Increases in the frequency and the total were a
   characteristic feature of extreme precipitation changes, particularly in
   winter. Seasonal variations in the spatial patterns of extreme
   precipitation trends may have resulted from seasonal changes in the
   prominence of the driving factors of precipitation. In spring, upward
   trends in Central and Western Europe were twice as frequent as the
   downward trends found primarily in Southern Europe. In summer, the
   percentages of significant downward trends in Western Europe and upward
   trends in Eastern Europe were similar. In autumn, a coherent decrease in
   extreme precipitation was clear in Central Europe. The spatial
   distribution of trend directions was the most consistent in winter.},

Title = {Emergent behavior and uncertainty in multimodel climate projections of
   precipitation trends at small spatial scales},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {19},
Number = {21},
Pages = {5554-5569},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Aspects of model emergent behavior and uncertainty in regional- and
   small-scale effects of increasing CO2 on seasonal (June-August)
   precipitation are explored. Nineteen different climate models are
   studied. New methods of comparing multiple climate models reveal a
   clearer and more impact- relevant view of precipitation projections for
   the current century. First, the importance of small spatial scales in
   multimodel projections is demonstrated. Local trends can be much larger
   than or even have an opposing sign to the large-scale regional averages
   used in previous studies. Small-scale effects of increasing CO2 and
   natural internal variability both play important roles here. These
   small-scale features make multimodel comparisons difficult for
   precipitation. New methods that allow information from small spatial
   scales to be usefully compared across an ensemble of multiple models are
   presented. The analysis philosophy of this study works with statistical
   distributions of small-scale variations within climatological regions. A
   major result of this work is a set of emergent relationships coupling
   the small- and regional- scale effects of CO2 on precipitation trends.
   Within each region, a single relationship fits the ensemble of 19
   different climate models. Using these relationships, a surprisingly
   large part of the intermodel variance in small-scale effects of CO2 is
   explainable simply by the intermodel variance in the regional mean (a
   form of pattern scaling). Different regions show distinctly different
   relationships. These relationships imply that regional mean results are
   still useful, as long as the interregional variation in their
   relationship with impact- relevant extreme trends is recognized. These
   relationships are used to present a clear but rich picture of an aspect
   of model uncertainty, characterized by the intermodel spread in seasonal
   precipitation trends, including information from small spatial scales.},

Title = {Trend and variability of China precipitation in spring and summer:
   Linkage to sea-surface temperatures},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {24},
Number = {13},
Pages = {1625-1644},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Observational records in the past 50 years show an upward trend of
   boreal-summer precipitation over central eastern China and a downward
   trend over northern China. During boreal spring, the trend is upward
   over southeastern China and downward over central eastern China. This
   study explores the forcing mechanism of these trends in association with
   the global sea-surface temperature (SST) variations on the interannual
   and interdecadal time scales.
   Results based on singular value decomposition (SVD) analyses show that
   the interannual variability of China precipitation in boreal spring and
   summer can be well defined by two centres of action for each season,
   which are covarying with two interannual modes of SSTs. The first SVD
   modes of precipitation in spring and summer, which are centred in
   southeastern China and northern China respectively, are linked to an El
   Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO)-like mode of SSTs. The second SVD modes
   of precipitation in both seasons are confined to central eastern China,
   and are primarily linked to SST variations over the warm pool and the
   Indian Ocean. Features of the anomalous 850 hPa winds and 700 hPa
   geopotential height corresponding to these modes support a physical
   mechanism that explains the causal links between the modal variations of
   precipitation and SSTs.
   On the decadal and longer time scale, similar causal links are found
   between the same modes of precipitation and SSTs, except for the case of
   springtime precipitation over central eastern China. For this case,
   while the interannual mode of precipitation is positively correlated
   with the interannual variations of SSTs over the warm pool and Indian
   Ocean, the interdecadal mode is negatively correlated with a different
   SST mode, i.e. the North Pacific mode. The latter is responsible for the
   observed downward trend of springtime precipitation over central eastern
   China. For all other cases, both the interannual and interdecadal
   variations of precipitation can be explained by the same mode of SSTs.
   The upward trend of springtime precipitation over southeastern China and
   downward trend of summertime precipitation over northern China are
   attributable to the warming trend of the ENSO-like mode. The recent
   frequent summertime floods over central eastern China are linked to the
   warming trend of SSTs over the warm pool and Indian Ocean. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {The impacts of anthropogenic land use and land cover (LULC) changes on
   the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation in megacities have been
   highlighted in studies on urban climate change. In this study, we
   conducted a quantitative analysis of urban growth on the impact on
   precipitation in Shanghai, China. We considered four periods of LULC
   data in 1979, 1990, 2000 and 2010, in addition to the long-term
   (1979-2010) trend of daily precipitation. The results indicate that the
   trend in precipitation exhibit different characteristics for urban (Ur),
   outskirt of urban (OUr) and outer suburb (OS) regions. Most Ur regions
   had an upward trend in annual and extreme precipitation during
   1979-2010, while annual precipitation for the OUr and OS regions
   exhibited a decreasing trend. From 1979 to 2010, the areas of fastest
   expansion were located in the OUr region. The OS region, far away from
   the central area, had a relatively lower rate of change. In addition,
   OUr regions with rapid LULC changes exhibited higher increasing trends
   in annual and daily extreme precipitation, which is critical for the
   identification of frequent precipitation areas and the reliable
   projection of further changes.},

Abstract = {Precipitation change is determined by changes in frequency and
   intensity. Based on hourly and daily precipitation data sets in China
   (1961-2014) and CMIP6 model, this study found that observed
   inconsistency in the frequency trend at the two time resolutions (hourly
   and daily) reflected precipitation becoming more concentrated at 13.4\%
   of stations, resulting in the specific precipitation phenomenon of
   ``more hours in one day, but fewer days.{''} However, models exhibited
   opposite precipitation phenomenon at 16.5\% of stations and cannot
   reproduce the widespread increase in the proportion of extreme
   precipitation amounts (PA) in the total PA, especially at an hourly
   resolution. Although stations with significant trend from CMIP6
   approximately twice the observation, both CMIP6 and observations showed
   that frequency and intensity changes dominated the total PA trend at
   hourly and daily time resolutions, respectively. These results
   demonstrated that daily precipitation observations could not fully
   capture the important features of short-duration rainfall.},

Abstract = {Having a better understanding of how extreme rainfall events change the
   future climate is vital due to its large impact on society. One of the
   factors that need to be considered is atmospheric temperature, where
   according to Clausius-Clapeyron relation, extreme rainfall is expected
   to increase at the rate of 7\% per degree of warming. This paper
   investigates the trend of extreme rainfall by analysing observational
   data in Peninsular Malaysia and comparing it against regional climate
   models (RCM) simulations of historical climate. The study showed that
   RCM is driven by EC-EARTH generally performs better in simulating the
   trend of extreme rainfall with surface air temperature in Peninsular
   Malaysia compared to the model driven by IPSL-CM5A-LR. Furthermore, the
   study showed that extreme rainfall is decreasing with the increase of
   temperature at a large area across Peninsular Malaysia.

Title = {Why does precipitation in northwest China show a significant increasing
   trend from 1960 to 2010?},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {275-284},

Abstract = {Based on monthly precipitation data from 74 weather stations in the arid
   region of northwest China, we employed statistical methods to analyse
   the characteristics of precipitation and investigated the relationships
   between precipitation and 11 atmospheric circulations. The results
   showed that the precipitation in northwest China had a significantly
   increasing trend (P < 0.01), at a rate of 0.61 mm/year, which is higher
   than the average rate of China (-0.16 mm/year) for the same period.
   Annual precipitation increased markedly after 1987, but the increase in
   precipitation gradually declined from north to south and from west to
   east. We found that the precipitation variation in spring, summer,
   autumn, and winter plays an important role in the yearly change,
   accounting for 21.6\%, 42.4\%, 18.4\%, and 17.6\%, respectively. The
   correlation analysis indicated that the annual precipitation revealed
   strong and significant associations with the West Pacific Subtropical
   High (WPSH, R = 0.60, P < 0.001) and the North America Subtropical High
   (NASH, R = 0.57, P < 0.001) from 1960 to 2010. We therefore suggest that
   the strengthening of the WPSH and NASH after the mid-1980s is probably
   the main cause for the significant increasing trend of precipitation in
   northwest China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {On the basis of a newly developed intensive hourly observational

   investigated. Results indicate that the hourly precipitation over South
   China featured a significant increasing trend, particularly for the
   extreme precipitation category. The trend is mainly due to the
   increasing frequency of the precipitation events. A possible mechanism
   accounting for this increasing trend was proposed: the global warming
   may be the original forcing for the trend, through its modulation on
   activities of the western Pacific subtropical high, but the low-level
   vorticity is the most important direct trigger.},

Abstract = {Trends of annual maximum 1-day precipitation in three major Hawaiian
   Islands are investigated using a nonparametric Mann-Kendall method and
   Sen's test (MKS). The records are from 24 stations on Oahu, Maui, and
   Hawaii, and the period of analysis ranges from 1960 to 2009. To
   complement the MKS method, a non-stationary three-parameter generalized
   extreme value (GEV) distribution is also used to detect trends in
   precipitation extremes. Both methods demonstrate that negative trends
   prevail for Oahu and Maui but positive trends dominate the Island of
   Hawaii. The influence of the location and the scale parameter in the GEV
   model on different return levels (2-year, 20-year, and 100-year) are
   explicitly described. The return-level threshold values are found to
   change with time considerably. As a result, a rare storm with daily
   precipitation of 300 mm (20-year return period) in 1960 has become a
   rather common storm event (3-5-year return period) in 2009 on the Island
   of Hawaii. The opposite trend behavior in extreme events is observed on
   Oahu and Maui, where rainfall extremes have become less frequent in the
   last five decades. A positive relationship is found between the
   precipitation extremes and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), implying
   greater extreme events during La Nina years and the opposite for El Nino
   years.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a remarkable
   method that creates sustainable cementitious binding material for use in
   geotechnical/structural engineering and environmental engineering. This
   is due to the increasing demand for alternative environmentally friendly
   technologies and materials that result in minimal or zero carbon
   footprint. In contrast to the previously published literature, through
   bibliometric analysis, this review paper focuses on the current
   prospects and future research trends of MICP technology via the Scopus
   database and VOSviewer analysis. The objective of the study was to
   determine the annual publications and citations trend, most contributing
   countries, the leading journals, prolific authors, productive
   institutions, funding sponsors, trending author keywords, and research
   directions of MICP. There were a total of 1058 articles published from
   2001 to 2021 on MICP. The result demonstrated that the volume of
   publications is increasing. China, Construction and Building Materials,
   Satoru Kawasaki, Nanyang Technological University, and the National
   Natural Science Foundation of China are the leading country, journal,
   author, institution, and funding sponsor in terms of total publications.
   Through the co-occurrence analysis of the author keywords, MICP was
   revealed to be the most frequently used author keyword with 121
   occurrences, a total link strength of 213, and 152 links to other author
   keywords. Furthermore, co-occurrence analysis of text data revealed that
   researchers are concentrating on four important research areas:
   precipitation, MICP, compressive strength, and biomineralization. This
   review can provide information to researchers that can lead to novel
   ideas and research collaboration or engagement on MICP technology.},

Title = {Instrumental agreement and retrospective analysis of trends in
   precipitation extremes in the French Mediterranean Region},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {In this letter we show the emergence of an agreement between the
   instruments of a rain-gauge network to point toward a positive trend in
   daily precipitation extremes since 1960 in the French Mediterranean
   Region. We identify for each gauge the time varying parameters of the
   generalized extreme value distribution of annual maximum precipitation
   over incremental time-windows. These distributions provide for each
   station of the network a trend assessment over a chosen period that can
   be interpreted for instance as a trend of the mean or as the trend of a
   chosen quantile. The incremental window, i.e. a window containing the
   series of data available at a given date, mimics the annual assessment
   of the trends that could have been made through time. Each year we thus
   have one trend per gauge that we can look in distribution through the
   network in order to assess the level of consensus among instruments. We
   show how the increasing size of the datasets used over a period of
   possible climate non-stationarity progressively leads from a dissensus
   anarchically pointing to no trend (before the 2000s) to a consensus
   where a majority of gauges points toward a positive trend (after the
   2000s). The detected trend in this Mediterranean Region is quite
   substantial. For instance the 20 year return period precipitation in
   1960 turns out to become a 8 year return period precipitation in 2020.
   Using a simulation basis we try to characterize the effect of decadal
   variability that is quite readable in the consensus evolution. The
   proposed metrics is thought to be a good candidate for the assessment of
   the local time and rate of emergence of climate change that has
   important implications in regards to adaptation of human and natural
   systems.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather events have a huge impact on human beings and therefore
   it is of vital importance to investigate trends in relevant
   climatological and hydrological variables. In this study, precipitation
   and streamflow trends in Zhejiang Province in east China are analysed.
   Trends in annual and extreme precipitation for 18 meteorological
   stations (data periods 42 to 58 years) are studied using the
   Mann-Kendall test. Trends in the plum season (May July) and typhoon
   season (August October) are analysed separately as well. The scaling
   properties of streamflow for three hydrological stations (data periods
   47 to 57 years) are determined using the detrended fluctuation analysis
   (DFA) method. Results show a positive trend in annual precipitation in
   the east and a negative one in the west. The major part of Zhejiang
   shows a positive trend in extreme precipitation, being more significant
   for 95\% non-exceedence values than for 99\% non-exceedence values.
   Precipitation intensity exhibits an upward trend in most areas and in
   both plum and typhoon seasons, especially in the coastal areas. The
   results of the DFA method show that long-term memory properties exist
   for one year in all three rivers. This time scale can be explained since
   the main source of the streamflow variation comes from climatic
   variability and the fact that annual streamflow cycles did not change.},

Abstract = {Understanding past changes in precipitation extremes could help us
   predict their future dynamics. We present a novel approach for analyzing
   trends in extremes and attributing them to changes in the local
   precipitation regime. The approach relies on the separation between
   intensity and occurrence of storms. We examine the relevant case of the
   Eastern Italian Alps, where significant trends in extreme precipitation
   were reported. The model is able to reproduce the observed trends at all
   durations between 15 min and 24 hr, and allows us to quantify trends in
   extreme return levels. Despite the significant increase in storm
   occurrence and typical intensity, the observed trends can be only
   explained considering changes in the tail heaviness of the intensity
   distribution, that is the proportion between heavy and mild events. Our
   results suggest that the observed changes are caused by an increased
   proportion of summer convective storms.},

Abstract = {Trends in the temporal and spatial irregularity of precipitation were
   analysed for the geographic area between 30 degrees S and 35 degrees S
   latitude for the period from 1965 to 2010. Daily rainfall records from a
   total of 55 randomly distributed weather stations were used for the
   analysis. Statistical indicators were constructed based on this
   information in order to ascertain spatial patterns of precipitation and
   other irregularity indices with an emphasis on the temporal irregularity
   index (S1) and the coefficient of variation (CV). Although the study
   confirmed that precipitation quantities increase with latitude and
   elevation, there are some geographic peculiarities which stand out,
   particularly leeward of the Cordillera de la Costa. Both the CV and the
   S1 diminish in value as latitude increases, but there is no particular
   pattern with respect to elevation. The study area exhibits very high CV
   and S1 which makes it difficult to explain the variability of
   precipitation in this region. For this reason, a new classification
   which is much relevant to the mediterranean climate of central Chile was
   obtained through cluster analysis. Finally, it is significant that both
   indicators are strongly correlated and exhibit consistency with the
   scientific literature.},

Abstract = {Using nonparametric Mann-Kendall tests, we assessed long-term
   (1953-2012) trends in streamflow and precipitation in Northern
   California and Southern Oregon at 26 sites regulated by dams and 41
   unregulated sites. Few (9\%) sites had significant decreasing trends in
   annual precipitation, but September precipitation declined at 70\% of
   sites. Site characteristics such as runoff type (groundwater, snow, or
   rain) and dam regulation influenced streamflow trends. Decreasing
   streamflow trends outnumbered increasing trends for most months except
   at regulated sites for May-September. Summer (July-September) streamflow
   declined at many sites, including 73\% of unregulated sites in
   September. Applying a LOESS regression model of antecedent precipitation
   vs. average monthly streamflow, we evaluated the underlying streamflow
   trend caused by factors other than precipitation. Decreasing trends in
   precipitation-adjusted streamflow substantially outnumbered increasing
   trends for most months. As with streamflow, groundwater-dominated sites
   had a greater percent of declining trends in precipitation-adjusted
   streamflow than other runoff types. The most pristine
   surface-runoff-dominated watersheds within the study area showed no
   decreases in precipitation-adjusted streamflow during the summer months.
   These results suggest that streamflow decreases at other sites were
   likely due to more increased human withdrawals and vegetation changes
   than to climate factors other than precipitation quantity.},

Abstract = {A second generation adjusted precipitation daily dataset has been
   prepared for trend analysis in Canada. Daily rainfall and snowfall
   amounts have been adjusted for 464 stations for known measurement issues
   such as wind undercatch, evaporation and wetting losses for each type of
   rain-gauge, snow water equivalent from ruler measurements, trace
   observations and accumulated amounts from several days. Observations
   from nearby stations were sometimes combined to create time series that
   are longer; hence, making them more useful for trend studies. In this
   new version, daily adjustments are an improvement over the previous
   version because they are derived from an extended dataset and enhanced
   metadata knowledge. Datasets were updated to cover recent years,
   including 2009. The impact of the adjustments on rainfall and snowfall
   total amounts and trends was examined in detail. As a result of
   adjustments, total rainfall amounts have increased by 5 to 10\% in
   southern Canada and by more than 20\% in the Canadian Arctic, compared
   to the original observations, while the effect of the adjustments on
   snowfall were larger and more variable throughout the country. The slope
   of the rain trend lines decreased as a result of the larger correction
   applied to the older rain-gauges while the slope of the snow trend lines
   increased, mainly along the west coast and in the Arctic. Finally,
   annual and seasonal rainfall and snowfall trends based on the adjusted
   series were computed for 1950-2009 and 1900-2009. Overall, rainfall has
   increased across the country while a mix of non-significant increasing
   and decreasing trends was found during the summer in the Canadian
   Prairies. Snowfall has increased mainly in the north while a significant
   decrease was observed in the southwestern part of the country for
   1950-2009. Resume {[}Traduit par la redaction] Un ensemble de donnees

   rapport a la version precedente parce qu'ils sont derives d'un ensemble
   de donnees etendu et d'une meilleure connaissance des metadonnees. Les
   ensembles de donnees ont ete mis a jour pour inclure les annees
   recentes, y compris 2009. L'effet des ajustements sur les hauteurs
   totales et les tendances des chutes de pluie et des chutes de neige a
   ete examine en detail. En raison des ajustements, les hauteurs totales
   de pluie ont augmente de 5 a 10\% dans le sud du Canada et de plus de
   20\% dans l'Arctique canadien, comparativement aux observations
   originales, alors que l'effet des ajustements sur les chutes de neige
   etait plus important et plus variable a travers le pays. La pente des
   lignes de tendance de la pluie a diminue par suite de la plus forte
   correction appliquee aux pluviometres plus anciens alors que la pente
   des lignes de tendance de la neige a augmente, surtout le long de la
   cote ouest et dans l'Arctique.
   Finalement, les tendances annuelles et aisonnieres des chutes de pluie
   et des chutes de neige basees sur les series ajustees ont ete calculees
   pour 1950-2009 et 1900-2009. Dans l'ensemble, les chutes de pluie ont
   augmente dans le pays alors qu'on a trouve un melange de tendances non
   significatives a la hausse et a la baisse durant l'ete dans les prairies
   canadiennes. Les chutes de neige ont augmente principalement dans le
   nord alors qu'une diminution marquee a ete observee dans la partie
   sud-ouest du pays pour 1950-2009.},

Title = {Contributions of Tropical Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers to Extreme
   Precipitation Trends Over the Northeast US},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Northeast United States (NEUS) has faced the most rapidly increasing
   occurrences of extreme precipitation within the US in the past few
   decades. Understanding the physics leading to long-term trends in
   regional extreme precipitation is essential but the progress is limited
   partially by the horizontal resolution of climate models. The latest
   fully coupled 25-km GFDL (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) SPEAR
   (Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system Research) simulations
   provide a good opportunity to study changes in regional extreme
   precipitation and the relevant physical processes. Here, we focus on the
   contributions of changes in synoptic-scale events, including atmospheric
   rivers (AR) and tropical cyclone (TC)-related events, to the trend of
   extreme precipitation in the fall season over the Northeast US in both
   the recent past and future projections using the 25-km GFDL-SPEAR. In
   observations, increasing extreme precipitation over the NEUS since the
   1990s is mainly linked to TC-related events, especially those undergoing
   extratropical transitions. In the future, both AR-related and TC-related
   extreme precipitation over the NEUS are projected to increase, even
   though the numbers of TCs in the North Atlantic are projected to
   decrease in the SPEAR simulations using the SSP5-8.5 projection of
   future radiative forcing. Factors such as enhancing TC intensity,
   strengthening TC-related precipitation, and/or westward shift in
   Atlantic TC tracks may offset the influence of declining Atlantic TC
   numbers in the model projections, leading to more frequent TC-related
   extreme precipitation over the NEUS.
   In recent decades, the densely populated Northeast United States has
   faced the most rapid increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall
   within the US. Here, we examine the causes of the increase in extreme
   rainfall over the Northeast US in both current and future climates. We
   find that the surge in extreme rainfall since the 1990s is primarily
   linked to events associated with tropical cyclones. In a future warming
   climate, based on projections from a high-resolution climate model, our
   research shows that we can expect more frequent occurrences of extreme
   rainfall related to both atmospheric rivers and tropical cyclones.
   However, the increase in extreme rainfall linked to atmospheric rivers
   is projected to outpace that associated with tropical cyclones. Given
   the distinct spatial patterns of extreme rainfall resulting from
   atmospheric rivers and tropical cyclones, changes in their relative
   contributions could have profound implications for flood prevention and
   mitigation strategies.
   The autumn extreme precipitation trend over the Northeast US is
   primarily attributed to tropical cyclone-related events since the 1990s
   In future projections, extreme precipitation linked to atmospheric
   rivers increases faster than that associated with tropical cyclones
   Despite fewer projected tropical cyclones in the future, extreme
   precipitation associated with them is projected to increase},

Abstract = {Extreme precipitation is a great concern for West Africa country, as it
   has serious consequence on key socio-economic activities. We use high
   resolution data from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
   Stations (CHIRPS) to determine the spatial variability, trend of 8
   extreme precipitation indices in West Africa and their relationship to
   remote indices. Spatial variability of extreme is characterized by
   maximum precipitation over the orographic regions, and in southern
   Sahel. The trend analysis shows a decrease of dry condition in Sahel and
   Sahara, and an increase tendency of wet indices over western Sahel and
   southern Sahel. The correlation analysis reveals that extreme
   precipitation in Sahel is strongly teleconnected to the Eastern
   Mediterranean Sea (EMS), whereas western and western-north Sahel is
   associated with both Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM), Maiden Julian
   Oscillation phase 8 (MJO8), El Nino 3.4 index (NINO.3.4), and
   Trans-Atlantic-Pacific Ocean Dipole Index (TAPODI) but with different
   characteristics or directions. Guinean coast extreme precipitation is
   highly associated with Atlantic zone 3 SST anomaly (ATL3), Northern Cold
   Tongue Index (NCTI), TAPODI but also with an opposite sign with NINO.3.4
   and in somewhat with the MJO8.},

Title = {Exploring trends in wet-season precipitation and drought indices in wet,
   humid and dry regions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study examines wet season droughts using eight products from the
   Frequent Rainfall Observations on GridS database. The study begins by
   evaluating wet season precipitation totals and wet day counts at
   seasonal and decadal time scales. While we find a high level of
   agreement among the products at a seasonal time scale, evaluations of 10
   year variability indicate substantial non-stationary inter-product
   differences that make the assessment of low-frequency changes difficult,
   especially in data-sparse regions. Some products, however, appear more
   reliable than others on decadal time scales. Global time series of dry,
   middle, and wet region standardized precipitation index time series
   indicate little coherent change. There is substantial coherence in
   year-to-year variations in these time series for the better-performing
   products, likely indicative of skill for monitoring variations at large
   spatial scales. During the wet season, the data do not appear to
   indicate widespread global changes in precipitation, reference
   evapotranspiration (RefET) or Standardized Precipitation
   Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) values. These data also do not indicate
   a global shift towards increasing aridity. Focusing on SPEI values for
   dry regions during droughts, however, we find modest increases in RefET
   and decreases in SPEI when wet season precipitation is below normal. Dry
   region SPEI values during droughts have decreased by -0.2 since the
   1990s. The cause of these RefET increases is unclear, and more detailed
   analysis will be needed to confirm these results. For wet regions,
   however, the majority of products appear to indicate increases in wet
   season precipitation, although many products perform poorly in these
   regions due to limited observation networks, and estimated increases
   vary substantially. Synopsis: Our analysis indicates a lack of
   increasing aridity at global scales, issues associated with
   non-stationary systematic errors, and concerns associated with increases
   in reference evapotranspiration in global dry regions during droughts.},

   Implications for Agricultural Production},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to modify the hydrological cycle resulting in
   a change in the amount, frequency, and intensity of surface
   precipitation. How the future hydrological pattern will look is
   uncertain. Climate change is expected to bring about intense periods of
   dryness and wetness, and such behavior is expected to be difficult to
   predict. Such uncertainty does not bode well for the agricultural
   systems of the United States (US) Midwest that are reliant on natural
   precipitation systems. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the
   behavior of precipitation during the cropping period. The manifestation
   of global-warming-related changes has already been reported for the last
   couple of decades and more so in the current decade. Thus, precipitation
   data from the recent past can provide vital information on what is about
   to come. In this study, the precipitation data of Illinois, a Midwestern
   state of the US with rain-fed agriculture, was analyzed with a focus on
   the climate dynamics during the cropping period. It was observed that
   even though there has been some increase in the annual precipitation
   amount (+ 1.84 mm/year) due to the increase in precipitation frequency
   and intensity, such change happened outside of the cropping period,
   thereby ensuring that climate change has not manifested itself during
   the cropping period.},

Abstract = {Mediterranean hydroclimatic region is one of the sensitive regions to
   climate variation, particularly to precipitation changes in Turkey. In
   this study, trends are estimated for different durations of annual
   extreme time scales (t = 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours) for approximately 50
   years were examined for the seven stations in Mediterranean
   hydroclimatic region. Non-parametric tests (such as Mann-Kendall and
   Sen's T tests) were used to determine precipitation trends. The
   direction of the annual extreme precipitation trends is, in general,
   upward. Izmir station has the most significant positive trend in all
   durations. Antalya and Bursa have also increased for some duration.
   There are precipitation anomalies in 1973 and 1974 over Turkey for the
   influence of the NAO. So the annual extreme rainfall data set divided
   into two groups, before 1973 and after 1974, for all stations. The same
   Mann - Kendall and Sen's T tests procedure are applied and considered to
   search for possible trends taking into account North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) Index. In general, according to this study NAO has a
   significant effect on Mediterranean precipitation trends.},

Abstract = {Significant seasonal changes have been observed in the study area,
   despite small annual precipitation trends for period 1951-2000 (e.g.,
   Franke et al., 2004; Hansel et al., 2009). Precipitation increases in
   winter are generally connected with more frequent and/or severe heavy
   precipitation events, while negative heavy precipitation trends
   predominantly occurred during the increasingly drier summer half of the
   year. A monthly trend analysis was done for 112 daily precipitation
   series with variable data availability within the period 1931 to 2006.
   Long-term trends of monthly precipitation totals and several `Heavy
   Precipitation Indicators' (HPI) were calculated and compared for
   different periods (e.g., 1931/1941/1951 to 2006).},

Abstract = {The main concern of this study is using a new type of Innovative trend
   analysis (ITA) method with a particular graphical illustration. It
   compares the results with the classic MK trend test at a 95\% confidence
   level. Among the 15 annual and seasonal data series (3 weather stations
   annually, spring, summer, autumn, and winter) studied, the MK trend test
   found significant increasing trends of 3 data series (20\%). However,
   using the new ITA method, 6 data series (40\%) `high' and `low'
   simultaneously showed a significant increasing trend. The new ITA method
   can also detect all significant trends identified by the MK trend test.
   As for the new ITA method, the `high' values of the 12 data series
   (80\%) exhibited significant increasing patterns, and the 9 data series
   (60\%) displayed significant increasing patterns for `low' values.
   According to the `low' and `high' values, a gain one data series (6.7\%)
   manifested significant decreasing trends. These results detailed annual
   and seasonal precipitation data series patterns by evaluating `low' and
   `high' values. The findings also demonstrated that the new method runs
   counter to the previous ITA.},

Abstract = {The study and investigation of precipitation trends is quite important
   for a country like India, whose economy is largely based on agriculture,
   which in turn is significantly affected by water availability. Almost
   83\% of water is used in agriculture, 12\% is consumed by industries and
   a mere 5\% is used for domestic purposes. In the present study, the long
   term trend based on rainfall data of 115 years (1901-2015) was analyzed
   at annual and seasonal (pre-monsoon/summer, monsoon,
   post-monsoon/winter) scale. After checking for cross-correlation in the
   data, Mann-Kendall test (MK) was applied, and in order to identify the
   trends, Sen's slope estimator was used and the overall percent change
   for the rainfall over the study area was calculated. To interpolate the
   spatial pattern, an inverse distance weighted interpolation method (IDW)
   was used using ArcGIS 10.2.2. The analysis showed a significant decrease
   in the trend of rainfall for annual and seasonal series during the
   entire time period.},

   Upward trends in precipitation intensity and 5-day total precipitation
   amounts prevail from 1950 to 2010. Longer drought duration is also
   noted, in southern Taiwan in particular. Daily precipitation during the

   Precipitation intensity induced by typhoons and monsoon systems has both
   increased over the last 60years; these two components collectively
   contribute to strong upward trend in precipitation intensity.},

Abstract = {1090 precipitation samples were collected between 1989 and 2006 from the
   Lijiang region, an internationally important tourist site in Yunnan
   province, southwestern China. All the samples were analyzed for pH,
   electrical conductivity, SO42-, Cl-, NO3-, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and NH4+
   concentrations. pH had a mean value of 6.08 and showed a slight increase
   as tourism developed between 1989 and 2006. SO42- and Ca2+ were the
   dominant anion and cation, respectively. Most of the ions showed
   significantly increasing trends, especially Ca2+ and Mg2+, with the
   exception of NH4+ that had a clearly decreasing trend. As a result, the
   neutralization capacity of Ca2+ increased significantly, and the
   precipitation NP/AP (neutralizing potential index/acidifying potential
   index) ratio increased. There was a significant correlation between the
   soil-derived cations Ca2+ and Mg2+, and significant correlation of SO42-
   with Ca2+ and Mg2+. The sea-salt species Cl- and Na+ was not well
   correlated. Using Na+ as a sea-salt tracer, non-sea-salt source
   fractions were calculated as SO42-: 99.1\%, Mg2+: 92.6\% and Ca2+:
   99.8\%. Furthermore, about 95.4\% of NO3- and 41.7\% of SO42- were
   contributed by anthropogenic sources, and 57.4\% of SO42- was
   contributed by soil/dust sources that had a remarkably strong
   relationship (r = 0.65, p<0.01) with the number of tourists, suggesting
   that human activities in a tourism-oriented city increase atmospheric
   dust loading. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change is acknowledged as the world's significant environmental
   predicament. Rainfall and temperature have been widely studied in
   correlation with climate change. This paper demonstrates the result of
   the trend analysis of rainfall variables over the period of 1984 to 2013
   and temperature variables over the period of 1979 to 2013 in Brunei
   Darussalam. Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to analyse and detect
   trends for the variables. This study revealed that the observed rainfall
   has a statistically significant increasing trend with increasing
   rainfall duration and decreasing intensity. The annual rainfall has
   increased significantly at a rate of 26.16 mm per annum. Mann-Kendall
   test for rainfall data reveals an increasing trend at confidence level
   of 95\% for the annual total rainfall and confidence of level 90\% for
   of annual maximum rainfall. The observed temperature also exhibits a
   statistically significant increasing trend at a rate of 0.031 degrees C
   per year. Results of Mann-Kendall test for temperature data indicate a
   positive trend at a confidence level of 99.9\% for the annual average
   temperature, average day time temperature, minimum day time temperature,
   average night time temperature and minimum night time temperature and at
   a confidence level of 95\% for maximum night time temperature. The
   progressive effect of both the observed rainfall and temperature changes
   will contribute to greater surfaces run off and create flooding problem.
   Too much rainfall will threaten slope stability while dry periods of
   increased temperature will cause soil erosion.},

   for 18712008 did not show any clear trend for the region as a whole,
   although there are seasonal trends for some seasons and for some
   hydro-meteorological subdivisions. Similar analysis for temperature data
   showed that all the four temperature variables (maximum, minimum, and
   mean temperatures and temperature range) had rising trend. Notably for
   the post-monsoon season, the Sen's estimator of slope ( degrees C/year)
   was 0.019, 0.011, and 0.015 for the maximum, minimum, and mean
   temperature, respectively. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal Meteorological

Abstract = {Analysis of spatial and temporal changes of long-term precipitation and
   extreme precipitation distribution at a local scale is very important
   for the prevention and mitigation of water-related disasters. In the
   present study, we have analyzed the long-term trend of 116 years
   (1901-2016) of precipitation and distribution of extreme precipitation
   index over the Kosi River Basin (KRB), which is one of the frequent
   flooding rivers of India, using the 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees
   resolution gridded precipitation datasets obtained from the Indian
   Meteorological Department (IMD), India. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   trend test together with Sen's slope estimator was employed to determine
   the trend and the magnitude of the trend of the precipitation time
   series. The annual and monsoon seasons revealed decreasing trends with
   Sen's slope values of -1.88 and -0.408, respectively. For the extreme
   indices viz. R10 and R20 days, a decreasing trend from the northeastern
   to the southwest part of the basin can be observed, whereas, in the case
   of highest one-day precipitation (RX1 day), no clear trend was found.
   The information provided through this study can be useful for
   policymakers and may play an important role in flood management, runoff,
   and understanding related to the hydrological process of the basin. This
   will contribute to a better understanding of the potential risk of
   changing rainfall patterns, especially the extreme rainfall events due
   to climatic variations.},

   United States: Applications for Stochastic Weather Generation},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {An increasing focus of climate change studies is the projection of storm
   events characterized by heavy, very heavy, extreme, and/or intense
   precipitation. Projected changes in the spatiotemporal distributions of
   such intense precipitation events remain uncertain due to large measures
   of variability in both the definition and evidence of increased
   intensity in the upper percentile range of observed daily precipitation
   distributions, particularly on a regional basis. As a result, projecting
   changes in future precipitation at the upper tail of the distribution
   (i.e., the heavy to heaviest events), such as through the use of
   stochastic weather generator programs, remains challenging. One approach
   to address this challenge is to better define what constitutes intense
   precipitation events and the degree of location-specific adjustment
   needed for the weather generator programs to appropriately account for
   potential increases in precipitation intensity due to climate change. In
   this study, we synthesized information on categories of intense
   precipitation events and assessed reported trends in the categories at
   national and regional scales within the context of applying this
   information to stochastic weather generation. Investigations of
   adjusting weather generation models to include long-term regional trends
   in intense precipitation events are limited, and modeling trends in
   site-specific future precipitation distributions forecasted by weather
   generator programs remains challenging. Probability exceedance curves
   and variations between simulated and observed distributions can help in
   modeling and assessment of trends in future extreme precipitation events
   that reflect changes in precipitation intensity due to climate change.},

Abstract = {In this work we present a homogenized high-resolution data set composed
   of 200 daily precipitation series spanning the last 90 years, located
   over an area centred on the TrentinoSouth Tyrol region (central part of
   the European Alps), in a transition zone between the climates of the
   southern and northern slopes of the Alps. We analysed the trends of
   total precipitation (TP), wet days (WD) and average intensity (PI), as
   well as trends of the number of events and precipitation amounts
   belonging to 12 different daily intensity categories. For an easier
   understanding of geographical patterns, we set up a gridded data set in
   terms of anomalies, with a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees. All the
   statistics were analysed for trend over the entire period spanned by the
   data and on subperiods of variable length. On regional average, we found
   a weak decrease in TP (about 1\%/decade with respect to the 1971-2000
   mean) over the entire studied period (1922-2009), which was
   statistically significant only in spring. Gridded data show that the
   decrease is related to a reduction in the number of WD in the eastern
   part of the study area, and a decrement in PI in the western part, with
   orography playing a clear role in this differentiation. On a daily
   scale, trends of the strongest events present scarce spatial coherence
   and are only locally significant, however the results are highly
   dependent on the period analysed. Comparisons with previous
   low-resolution studies on the same area underline the importance of a
   high-resolution data set in characterizing spatial variability of
   climatic trends in precipitation. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal

Abstract = {Rainfall trends in subtropical South America east of the Andes during
   the period 1960-1999 were studied in connection with El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) phases. In addition, monthly mean sea level pressure
   (SLP) fields from the National Center for Environmental Prediction
   reanalysis were used to look at the connection between rainfall trends
   and the interannual variability of the low-level atmospheric
   circulation. South of 22 degrees S, annual rainfall trends were positive
   everywhere, and statistically significant over part of western
   subtropical Argentina. Over most of the region, trends resulted mostly
   from the warm semester (October-March) trends with little contribution
   from the cold semester (April-September). Under certain conditions,
   linear precipitation trends of each ENSO phase add up to the total
   rainfall trend. In northeastern Argentina, southern Brazil and Paraguay,
   half of the annual rainfall trend came from El Nino phase with a minor
   contribution from La Nina and the neutral phase. However, in most of
   subtropical South America, east of the Andes, precipitation trends
   during the extreme phases of the ENSO constitute only a small part of
   the trends. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the
   monthly SLP fields of the austral warm semester. The mode that advects
   humid air from the Atlantic Ocean over most of Argentina and Uruguay has
   grown at the expense of the one that favors the flow from the tropical
   forest over the eastern part of the continent. South of 30 degrees S,
   annual rainfall trends took place predominantly during the neutral phase
   of the ENSO, and were related to the trends of the first two SLP leading
   modes. On the other hand, the annual trends were negative in the
   continental part of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), but with
   contributions from all ENSO phases.},

Abstract = {This article aims to review studies pertaining to trends in rainfall,
   rainy days and temperature over India. Sen's non-parametric estimator of
   slope has been frequently used to estimate the magnitude of trend, whose
   statistical significance was assessed by the Mann-Kendall test. Spatial
   units for trend analysis vary from station data to sub-division to
   sub-basin/river basins. There are differences in the results of the
   various studies, and a clear and consistent picture of rainfall trend
   has not emerged. Although the different units (sub-basins or
   sub-divisions) may have a non-zero slope value, few values are
   statistically significant. In a study on basin-wise trend analysis, 15
   basins had decreasing trend in annual rainfall; only one basin showed
   significant decreasing trend at 95\% confidence level. Among six basins
   showing increasing trend, one basin showed significant positive trend.
   Most of the basins had the same direction of trend in rainfall and rainy
   days at the annual and seasonal scale.
   Regarding trends in temperature, the mean maximum temperature series
   showed a rising trend at most of the stations; it showed a falling trend
   at some stations. The mean minimum temperature showed a rising as well
   as a falling trend. At most of the stations in the south, central and
   western parts of India a rising trend was found. Some stations located
   in the north and northeastern India showed a falling trend in annual
   mean temperature. Most of the data used in trend analysis pertained to
   the stations located in urban areas and these areas are sort of heat
   islands. This article also highlights the need of a network of baseline
   stations for climatic studies.},

Title = {Trends in New Zealand daily temperature and rainfall extremes},

Abstract = {Trends in daily temperature and rainfall indices are described for New
   Zealand. Two periods were examined: 1951-1998, to describe significant
   trends in temperature and rainfall parameters: and 1930-1998. to
   ascertain the effects of two main circulation changes that have occurred
   in the New Zealand region around 1950 and 1976.
   Indices examined included frequencies of daily maximum and minimum
   temperatures, above and below specified percentile levels and at those
   levels, as well as frequencies of these above and below fixed
   temperature thresholds. Extreme daily rainfall intensity and frequency
   above the 95th percentile and the length of consecutive dry day
   sequences were the rainfall indices selected.
   There were no significant trends in maximum temperature extremes ('hot
   days') but a significant increase in minimum temperatures was associated
   with decreases in the frequency of extreme `cold nights' over the
   48-year period. There was a non-significant tendency for an increase in
   the frequency of maximum temperature extremes in the north and northeast
   of New Zealand. A decline occurred in frequency of he minimum
   temperature 5th percentile ('cold nights) of 10-20 days a year in many
   locations. Trends in rainfall indices show a zonal pattern of response.
   with the frequency of 1-day 95th percentile extremes decreasing in the
   north and east, and increasing in the west over the 1951-1996 period.
   Changes in the frequency of threshold temperatures above 24.9 degreesC
   (25 degreesC days) and below 0 degreesC (frost days) are strongly linked
   to atmospheric circulation changes, coupled with regional warming. From
   1930-1950 more south to southwest anomalous flow occurred relative to
   later years. In this period. 25 degreesC days were less frequent in all
   areas except the northeast, and there was markedly more frost days in
   all but inland areas of the South Island compared with the 1951 - 1975
   period. There was more airflow from the cast and northeast from 1951 to
   1975, the frequency of 25 degreesC days increased and frost days

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to detect trends in maximum annual daily
   precipitation in the Upper Vistula Basin. We analyzed data from 51
   weather stations between 1971 and 2014. Then we used the Mann-Kendall
   test to detect monotonical trends of the precipitation for three
   significance levels: 1, 5, and 10\%. Our analysis of weather conditions
   helped us describe the mechanism behind the formation of maximum annual
   daily precipitation. To analyze precipitation seasonality, we also used
   Colwell indices. Our study identified a significant trend of the highest
   daily precipitation for the assumed significance levels (0.01, 0.05,
   0.1) for 22\% of the investigated weather stations at different
   elevations. The significant trends found were positive and an increase
   in precipitation is expected. From 1971 to 2014, the maximum daily total
   precipitation most often occurred in the summer half-year, i.e., from
   May until September. These months included a total of 88\% of days with
   the highest daily precipitation. The predictability index for the
   highest total precipitation within the area was high and exceeded 5\%.
   It was markedly affected by the coefficient of constancy (C) and to a
   lesser degree by the seasonality index (M). Our analysis demonstrated a
   convergence of the Colwell indices and frequency of cyclonic situation
   and, therefore, confirmed their usability in the analysis of
   precipitation seasonality.},

Abstract = {Intensification of heavy precipitation as discussed in climate change
   studies has become a public concern, but it has not yet been examined
   well with observed data, particularly with data at short temporal scale
   like hourly and sub-hourly data. The original data set was retrieved by
   using an automated recovery approach. We chose four stations, namely,
   Vercelli (since 1927), Bra (since 1933), Lombriasco (since 1939) and
   Pallanza (since 1950) which are located in the northwest of Italy. We
   assessed trends for durations from 5 min to 12 h in seasonal, annual
   maxima, and number and magnitude of exceedances of the 95th percentile.
   Split sample tests have been undertaken to assess differences in
   quantile estimates derived using a Generalised Pareto distribution
   fitted to Peaks-Over-Threshold series. The statistical analyses
   performed include parametric and non-parametric tests. Mostly, we cannot
   reject the trend stationarity hypothesis. There is no uniform trend on
   extreme events in the whole area. However, some trends are evident and
   significant for specific stations and specific indices. Specifically, it
   is obvious that extreme rainfall events have risen in the last 20 years
   only for short durations.},

Abstract = {The daily precipitation series of San Sebastian, Valencia and Badajoz
   are analysed for each of the annual seasons and for the hydrological
   year (Sep-Aug). To this end several indices descriptive of the
   precipitation distribution are computed: number of days of precipitation
   and rainfall within limits marked by the quartiles of the whole series,
   the shape and scale parameters gamma and beta of the fitted Gamma
   biparametric distribution. The most significant trends found are: a
   decrease in the number of days and precipitation in days in the
   inter-quartile range in San Sebastian for the year, summer and winter;
   an increase in the precipitation and number of days in the first
   quartile in summer and the year at Valencia; and in Badajoz a drop in
   spring of precipitation and of the number of days in the last quartile,
   whereas the precipitation and number of days rise in the year for the
   first quartile range. The parameter gamma drops significantly in San
   Sebastian (year and winter), Valencia (year and spring) and Badajoz
   (spring). The drop in 7 for the year is especially pronounced in San
   Sebastian and Badajoz since the sixties.
   For the extremes study, the trends in the number of days with
   precipitation greater than the 90\%, 95\% and 99\% percentiles are
   analysed, and only a significant decreasing trend was found for the
   autumn in San Sebastian (Q90). When those percentiles themselves are
   computed for each year, a clearly increasing trend is detected in San
   Sebastian for the spring.},

   Satellite Precipitation Product in Bundelkhand, India},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Drought hazard mapping and its trend analysis has become indispensable
   due to the aggravated impact of drought in the era of climate change.
   Sparse observational networks with minimal maintenance limit the
   spatio-temporal coverage of precipitation data, which has been a major
   constraint in the effective drought monitoring. In this study,
   high-resolution satellite-derived Climate Hazards Group Infrared
   Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data has been used for computation
   of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The study was carried out in
   Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, India, known for its substantial
   drought occurrences with poor drought management plans and lack of
   effective preparedness. Very limited studies have been carried out in
   assessing the spatio-temporal drought in this region. This study aims to
   identify district-wide drought and its trend characterization from 1981
   to 2018. The run theory was applied for quantitative drought assessment;
   whereas, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test was performed for trend analysis at
   seasonal and annual time steps. Results indicated an average of nine
   severe drought events in all the districts in the last 38 years, and the
   most intense drought was recorded for the Jalaun district (1983-1985). A
   significant decreasing trend is observed for the SPI1 (at 95\%
   confidence level) during the post-monsoon season, with the magnitude
   varying from -0.16 to -0.33 mm/month. This indicates the increasing
   severity of meteorological drought in the area. Moreover, a
   non-significant falling trend for short-term drought (SPI1 and SPI3)
   annually and short- and medium-term drought (SPI1, SPI3, and SPI6) in
   winter months have been also observed for all the districts. The output
   of the current study would be utilized in better understanding of the
   drought condition through elaborate trend analysis of the SPI pattern
   and thus helps the policy makers to devise a drought management plan to
   handle the water crisis, food security, and in turn the betterment of
   the inhabitants.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal of variation of meteorological drought and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {163},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Using monthly precipitation data from 15 stations, well spread over
   whole Mauritania, and recorded for a long period of time (1919-2016) of
   almost 100 years, a classification of drought is performed, based on its
   intensity and duration. For this purpose, the gamma-Standardized
   Precipitation Index (gamma-SPI) is used to detect drought events
   (drought frequency, duration and intensity). The Mann-Kendall Test (MK
   test) is employed for the trend analysis of the precipitation data at
   all stations and the Thiel-Sen Approach is used to calculate the
   magnitude of the slopes of the trends. The drought analysis results show
   that there were severe and extreme drought conditions seen all over the
   country, especially in 1970s and 1980s. This serious case seems to be
   emerging in early 2010s. The drought conditions in recent years seems to
   be more pronounced in the central and southern regions of the country.
   The trend analysis results reveal that there is no depletion observed in
   precipitation at the northern region. The total deficit in precipitation
   is about 100 mm or less during almost 100 year period at the western
   region. However, the results show that there is pronounced decrease in
   precipitation at the southern region, reaching to almost a total of 300
   mm deficit in nearly 100-year period.},

   summertime precipitation and trends are also investigated, and the
   influences of relocating observation stations on trends of summertime
   precipitation are verified. As a result, positive correlations between
   monthly precipitations and elevation are found, as in previous studies.
   An analysis of horizontal distributions of summertime precipitation
   indicates more precipitation in the southwestern part than the
   northeastern part of Nagano prefecture. A significant difference among
   trends of precipitation between relocated meteorological stations and
   others is not recognized. Regarding altitude dependence of trends of
   precipitation, trends of monthly precipitation in June tend to be small
   at high-altitude meteorological observation stations rather than at
   low-altitude stations. However, the negative correlation between annual
   change rates of monthly precipitation in June and elevation was caused
   by a decreasing trend of monthly precipitation in June at Ontakesan
   (Elevation: 2195 m) , which is statistically significant with a 5\%
   significance level. No significant relationship between trends of
   monthly precipitation and elevation was found in July, August, and
   September. An analysis of horizontal distributions of trends of
   summertime precipitation indicates that precipitation in June and
   September tended to decrease in the southern part of Nagano prefecture.},

Abstract = {Springtime extra-tropical cyclones (ETCs) in Northeast Asia and the
   associated precipitation anomalies are examined by objectively tracking
   ETCs from reanalysis data. The cluster analyses reveal that Northeast
   Asian cyclones are largely grouped into two distinct tracks, that is,
   north and south tracks, depending on their pathways. The south-track
   ETCs typically form over southeast China and travel towards the Japanese
   Islands, while the north-track ETCs are first detected around Mongolia
   and move southeastwards to the Korean Peninsula. Unlike the latter ones,
   the former ones exhibit a significant negative trend in their occurrence
   frequency (-1.17 per decade from 1979 to 2014), explaining a negative
   precipitation trend over the broad regions from southeast China to the
   Kyushu Islands. It is argued that the reduction of the south-track ETCs
   is at least in part caused by the strengthened convection over the
   tropical western Pacific. The resulting Gill-type response in the
   subtropics tends to drive reduced moisture supplies to southern China,
   likely causing an unfavourable condition for the development of the
   south-track ETCs.},

Abstract = {For the need of antierosion control it is necessary to know the
   occurrence and distribution of erosion-effective precipitation. Ample
   storm rainfall which occur in conditions of the Czech Republic are
   decisive, particularly in the period from May to the end of September.
   To evaluate the frequency of occurrence of such precipitation daily
   precipitation sums over 10, 20 and 30 mm (Tab. I) were chosen and they
   were evaluated for the station Brno-Turany for the period of 1961 to
   1990. Average annual frequencies of occurrence of higher daily sums of
   precipitation were set along with their trend of occurrence (Figs 1 to
   3). Figs 4 to 8 show the frequency of occurrence of daily sums of
   precipitation over 10 mm in different months and their trend. Annual
   sums of precipitation and trend of their occurrence in the years 1961 to
   1990 are in Fig. 9. The sum of precipitation in the months May to
   September and their trend is in Fig. 10. The results of the study
   testify the growing trend of occurrence of higher daily sums of
   precipitation, particularly with sums over 30 mm. It follows from this
   finding that the danger of occurrence of erosion phenomena grows in
   spite of that annual sums of precipitation show a slight falling
   tendency.},

Abstract = {Among several variables affecting climate change and climate
   variability, temperature plays a crucial role in the process because its
   variations in monthly and extreme values can impact on the global
   hydrologic cycle and energy balance through thermal forcing. In this
   study, an analysis of temperature data has been performed over 22 series
   observed in New Zealand. In particular, to detect possible trends in the
   time series, the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test was first applied at
   monthly scale and then to several indices of extreme daily temperatures
   computed since 1951. The results showed a positive trend in both the
   maximum and the minimum temperatures, in particular, in the
   autumn-winter period. This increase has been evaluated faster in maximum
   temperature than in minimum one. The trend analysis of the temperature
   indices suggests that there has been an increase in the frequency and
   intensity of hot extremes, while most of the cold extremes showed a
   downward tendency.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Previous estimates of temperature shock risk premiums in the stock
   market have been biased by the use of the Fama-MacBeth estimator, the
   use of monthly portfolios, and the neglect that temperature time-series
   can exhibit both short- and -long-term components. From the previous
   literature, we know that temperature shocks can increase equity premiums
   through a number of channels. I use the Jegadeesh et al. (2019) EIV
   estimation method and daily individual stock returns from the NYSE, ASE
   and NASDAQ from July 1, 1963 to Dec. 31, 2020, to correct for the
   estimation bias, and I divide the temperature series into long- and
   short -term components. I also control for productivity shocks,
   non-linearity and macroeconomic variables. I find that the US
   Short-Term, US Long-Term and the World Long-Term Temperature factors are
   significantly priced by the market at less than the 1\% level. Together,
   these three components are estimated to raise the cost of equity in the
   United States by 3.1\% per year, higher than previous estimates.},

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {54},

Abstract = {There is currently much attention being given to the observed increase
   in near-surface air temperatures during the last century. The proper
   investigation of heating trends, however, requires that we include
   surface heat content to monitor this aspect of the climate system.
   Changes in heat content of the Earth's climate are not fully described
   by temperature alone. Moist enthalpy or, alternatively, equivalent
   temperature, is more sensitive to surface vegetation properties than is
   air temperature and therefore more accurately depicts surface heating
   trends. The microclimates evident at many surface observation sites
   highlight the influence of land surface characteristics on local surface
   heating trends. Temperature and equivalent temperature trend differences
   from 1982-1997 are examined for surface sites in the Eastern U.S.
   Overall trend differences at the surface indicate equivalent temperature
   trends are relatively warmer than temperature trends in the Eastern U.S.
   Seasonally, equivalent temperature trends are relatively warmer than
   temperature trends in winter and are relatively cooler in the fall.
   These patterns, however, vary widely from site to site, so local
   microclimate is very important. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Incomplete global coverage is a potential source of bias in global
   temperature reconstructions if the unsampled regions are not uniformly
   distributed over the planet's surface. The widely used Hadley
   Centre-Climatic Reseach Unit Version 4 (HadCRUT4) dataset covers on
   average about 84\% of the globe over recent decades, with the unsampled
   regions being concentrated at the poles and over Africa. Three existing
   reconstructions with near-global coverage are examined, each suggesting
   that HadCRUT4 is subject to bias due to its treatment of unobserved
   regions.
   Two alternative approaches for reconstructing global temperatures are
   explored, one based on an optimal interpolation algorithm and the other
   a hybrid method incorporating additional information from the satellite
   temperature record. The methods are validated on the basis of their
   skill at reconstructing omitted sets of observations. Both methods
   provide results superior to excluding the unsampled regions, with the
   hybrid method showing particular skill around the regions where no
   observations are available.
   Temperature trends are compared for the hybrid global temperature
   reconstruction and the raw HadCRUT4 data. The widely quoted trend since
   1997 in the hybrid global reconstruction is two and a half times greater
   than the corresponding trend in the coverage-biased HadCRUT4 data.
   Coverage bias causes a cool bias in recent temperatures relative to the
   late 1990s, which increases from around 1998 to the present. Trends
   starting in 1997 or 1998 are particularly biased with respect to the
   global trend. The issue is exacerbated by the strong El Nino event of
   1997-1998, which also tends to suppress trends starting during those
   years.},

Abstract = {Stream temperature is an important property of water and affects most
   other water quality constituents. It is also a property which is very
   much influenced by exogenous factors like air temperature and stream
   flow. This study investigates long-term trends in stream temperatures
   measured at various stream monitoring stations in Turkey to better
   understand links with climate change. It was found by statistical trend
   analysis that more streams have experienced decreasing trends than
   increasing ones. Moreover, stream temperatures show a rising tendency in
   most stations over Turkey. Flow-adjusted temperatures were computed to
   eliminate flow dependency and these show more positive than negative
   trends. Management plans of streams and watersheds need to take this
   into account and incorporate the implications into plans.},

Abstract = {Long-term trends in summer precipitation totals, the number of rainy
   days, and precipitation intensity were investigated with daily rainfall
   datasets for China from 1961 to 2000. Total precipitation significantly
   increased in summer in the Yangtze River basin and northwestern China,
   while total precipitation decreased in other regions. The number of
   rainy days increased in the Yangtze River basin, and over northwestern
   China. In contrast, the number of rainy days decreased over Tibet and
   over northern and northeastern China. Seasonal mean precipitation
   intensity became large at most of the stations in China.
   To investigate trends in heavy rainfall, daily rainfall totals during
   the whole investigation period were grouped into ten classes, with class
   width equal to 10\% of total number of rainy days from 1961 to 2000, and
   the number of rainy days, and summer mean rainfall amount for each
   class, were obtained for each summer. A simple linear fit was made to
   determine the linear trends in the 10-class precipitation time series.
   The upper 20 percentile of daily precipitation totals showed a
   statistically significant increase over the Yangtze River basin, and
   over northwestern China during the study period. Class average
   precipitation decreased in almost 10 classes over Tibet and north and
   northeastern China.},

Title = {Exploring Spatio-Temporal Precipitation Variations in Istanbul: Trends
   and Patterns from Five Stations across Two Continents},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study aims to reveal the long-term station-based characteristics of
   precipitation in Istanbul, a mega city located on the continents of
   Europe and Asia, with complex topography and coastline along the Marmara
   and Black Seas. Using data from five different stations, three located
   in the European continent and two in the Asian continent, with
   measurement periods ranging from 72 to 93 years, wet and dry days have
   been identified, statistics on precipitation conditions during the warm
   and cold seasons have been generated, categorization based on
   precipitation intensities has been performed, and analyses have been
   conducted using extreme precipitation indices. At stations located in
   the northern part of the city, higher annual total precipitation has
   been observed compared to those in the south. A similar situation
   applies to the number of wet days. While during the cold season, the wet
   and dry day counts are nearly the same across all stations, this
   condition exhibits significant differences in favor of dry days during
   the warm season. Apart from dry conditions, ``moderate{''} precipitation
   is the most frequently observed type across all stations. However,
   ``extreme{''} events occur significantly more often (6\%) during the
   warm season compared to the cold season (2\%). Long-term anomalies in
   terms of annual precipitation totals have shown similarity between
   stations in the north and south, which has also been observed in
   longitudinally close stations. Despite the longer duration of the cold
   season and stronger temperature gradients, extreme rainfall events are
   more frequent during the warm season, primarily due to thunderstorm
   activity. While trend analyses revealed limited significant trends in
   precipitation intensity categories and extreme indices, the study
   highlights the importance of comprehensive examination of extreme
   rainfall events on both station-based and regional levels, shedding
   light on potential implications for regional climate change. Lastly,
   during the cold season, the inter-station correlation in terms of annual
   total precipitation amounts has been considerably higher compared to the
   warm season.},

Title = {High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Trend Analysis of Precipitation Using
   Satellite-Based Products over the United Arab Emirates},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Current water demands are adequately satisfied in the United Arab
   Emirates (UAE) with the available water resources. However, the changing
   climate and growing water demand pose a great challenge for water
   resources managers in the country. Hence, there is a great need for
   management strategies and policies to use the most accurate information
   regarding water availability. Understanding the frequency and the short-
   and long-term trends of the precipitation by employing high-resolution
   data in both the spatial and temporal domains can provide invaluable
   information. This study examines the long-term precipitation trends over
   the UAE using 17 years of data from three of the most highly cited
   satellite-based precipitation products and rain gauge data observed at
   18 stations. The UAE received, on average, 42, 51, and 120 wet hours in
   a year in the 21st century as recorded by CMORPH, PERSIANN, and IMERG,
   respectively. The results show that the areal average annual
   precipitation of the UAE is significantly lower in the early 21st
   century than that of the late 20th century, even though it shows an
   increasing trend by all the products. The Mann-Kendall trend test showed
   positive trends in six rain gauge stations and negative trends in two
   stations out of 18 stations, all of which are located in the wetter
   eastern part of the UAE. Results indicate that satellite products have
   great potential for improving the spatial aspects of rainfall frequency
   analysis and can complement rain gauge data to develop rainfall
   intensity-duration-frequency curves in a very dry region, where the
   installation of dense rain gauge networks is not feasible.},

Title = {An evaluation of statistical models for downscaling precipitation and
   their ability to capture long-term trends},

Abstract = {Large-scale changes in the sea-level pressure do not necessary reflect
   changes in the atmospheric moisture budget, and hence may not give a
   good representation of changes in precipitation as a result of a global
   warming. Statistical models that use both sea-level pressure and
   large-scale precipitation as predictors are evaluated for a number of
   locations in Fennoscandia. The statistical models in most cases were
   capable of capturing 60-80\% of the year-to-year seasonal variations in
   precipitation, and a correlation analysis over independent data
   indicated predictive correlation scores in the range 0.2-0.5. A
   comparison between statistical models based on large-scale
   precipitation, sea-level pressure, and a mixture of these, indicated
   similar skills in terms of variance and predictive skill of inter-annual
   variations. Analyses of their ability to capture recent precipitation
   trends reveal potential problems regarding reconstructing long-term
   changes in the past. One explanation for the statistical models not
   giving similar past trend values as given by the station observations
   may be partly because the precipitation trends during the most recent 50
   years are not well defined since the interval is not sufficiently long.
   This is supported by the fact that trend analysis for station
   observations based on two different data products, and different trend
   analysis strategies, do not correspond well with each other. An analysis
   for possible non-stationarities between large and local spatial scales
   does not indicate any significant presence of non-stationarities.

Title = {Quantifying the evolving role of intense precipitation runoff when

Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Eastern Texas straddles a precipitation zone that transitions from
   semi-arid grasslands to the humid, rainy conditions of the northern Gulf
   Coast. While several studies have quantified the changing magnitude and
   frequency of daily extreme events, the paucity of hourly datasets have
   limited insight into how the growing proportion of rainfall exceeding
   hourly soil infiltration capacity has and will exacerbate the state's
   droughts. This paper builds on previous analysis, deploying algorithms
   with a temporal dimension to calculate soil moisture scarcity from
   evapotranspiration and precipitation data based on FAO-56 methodology
   and then introduces a daily estimate of the proportion of precipitation
   that flows off the ground surface rather than replenishing moisture
   deficits for soils with three different infiltrative capacities at 12
   observation sites. The comparison of subsequent time-series regression
   analyses showed that absorptive soils in east Texas have experienced
   modest, though mostly statistically insignificant, acceleration in
   drought trends after the incorporation of hourly rainfall intensity
   data: for the 24 soil samples (out of 36) with saturated hydraulic

Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {454},

Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {According to the simulations of isotope-equipped general circulation
   models (GCMs) compiled by the Stable Water Isotope Intercomparison Group
   Phase2 (SWING2), the interannual variability and trend of precipitation
   isotopic composition in China during 1979-2007 are studied. Six
   simulations of isotope-enabled GCMs are involved, and monthly series of
   stable oxygen isotopes in precipitation for each grid are applied to
   calculate the linear trends from 1979 to 2007. Most isotope-equipped GCM
   simulations show an increasing trend in delta O-18, while the GISS-E
   (NCEP) result shows a decreasing trend. In most areas of north China and
   northwest China, the GCM-simulations positively correlate with surface
   temperature. The correlation coefficients between oxygen isotope
   composition and surface air temperature generally increase from coast to
   inland. The correlation between observed and simulated delta O-18 in
   precipitation of northwest China simulated by LMDZ (free) is best (r =
   0.73) among different subregions and isotope-equipped GCMs. The
   comparison of GCMs simulations and BW model all show the low value
   region of delta O-18 is in the Tibetan Plateau and the high value in
   south China. China's meteoric water line simulated using isotope-enabled
   GCMs (slopes range from 7.63 to 8.26, and intercepts range from 9.25 to
   11.92) is similar to the global meteoric water line, and all the
   correlation coefficients are statistically significant at the 0.01
   level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {GEOLOGICA BELGICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {157-163},
Abstract = {A set of 10 representative multi-decade long time series of piezometric
   levels of phreatic aquifers were selected in different parts of Low
   Belgium to investigate correlations between groundwater levels,
   precipitation rates and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index.
   Correlations between piezometric levels and precipitation rates are
   always high and significant at the 5\% level for all series. A direct
   relation between groundwater levels and the NAO is only possible if
   there is a correlation with aquifer recharge, which in north Belgium is
   limited to the winter period. Correlation between monthly precipitation
   and monthly NAO indices are highly temporal, with two distinct periods
   during which the correlation is significant at the 5\% level. In summer
   (July and August) there is a negative correlation, in winter time
   (December and January) a positive one. As in summer aquifer recharge is
   negligible, only the winter NAO index can have an impact on groundwater
   levels. Of the ten investigated series, only two have a significant
   correlation at the 5\% level, between piezometric levels and the
   December-January NAO values. Both wells lie in the same region, in the
   upper part of the lithologically heterogeneous Campine Complex. The
   local hydrogeological conditions here seem to increase sensitivity to
   winter NAO modus.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates precipitation trends in the upper Mzingwane
   sub-catchment (UMS) of Zimbabwe using ten World Meteorological
   Organization (WMO)'s Expert Team for Climate Change Detection Monitoring
   and Indices climate indices. Trend analysis for variables such as annual
   total precipitation, extremely wet days, consecutive wet and dry days is
   analysed. The UMS is of strategic socio-economic significance in terms
   of water security and sustenance to livelihoods in this region and the
   city of Bulawayo. The analysis is undertaken at four stations: Bulawayo
   Goetz, Filabusi, Mbalabala and Matopos National Park (MNP), for the
   period 1921-2000. In general, no statistically significant trends were
   detected for all indices in all stations (with the exception of MNP (in
   the westernmost extent of UMS)) which showed significant increasing
   (decreasing) trends for most dryness (total precipitation) extreme
   indices. This is indicative of persistent drying coupled with a shift
   towards shorter very wet periods with more intense precipitation in the
   past twentieth century. There is also an indication of a general north
   to south-western declining precipitation gradient during the past
   similar to 69 years over this region. These findings are not only useful
   in explaining the historical evolution of observed extremes and their
   associated socio-economic impacts but also present a baseline for
   comparative follow-up studies assessing the twenty-first century and
   future trends in precipitation extreme events in the UMS.},

Abstract = {We describe the nature of recent (50 year) rainfall variability in the
   summer rainfall zone, South Africa, and how variability is recognised
   and responded to on the ground by farmers. Using daily rainfall data and
   self organising mapping (SOM) we identify 12 internally homogeneous
   rainfall regions displaying differing parameters of precipitation
   change. Three regions, characterised by changing onset and timing of
   rains, rainfall frequencies and intensities, in Limpopo, North West and
   KwaZulu Natal provinces, were selected to investigate farmer perceptions
   of, and responses to, rainfall parameter changes. Village and household
   level analyses demonstrate that the trends and variabilities in
   precipitation parameters differentiated by the SOM analysis were clearly
   recognised by people living in the areas in which they occurred. A range
   of specific coping and adaptation strategies are employed by farmers to
   respond to climate shifts, some generic across regions and some
   facilitated by specific local factors. The study has begun to understand
   the complexity of coping and adaptation, and the factors that influence
   the decisions that are taken.},

Abstract = {Extreme precipitation events vary with different sub-regions, sites and
   years and show complex characteristics. In this study, the temporal
   variations, trends with significance and change points in the annual
   time series of 10 extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) at 552 sites and
   in seven sub-regions were analyzed using the modified Mann-Kendall test
   and sequential Mann-Kendall analysis. Three representative (extremely
   wet, normal and extremely dry) years from 1961 to 2017 were selected by
   the largest, 50\%, and smallest empirical frequency values in China. The
   spatiotemporal changes in the EPIs during the three representative years
   were analyzed in detail. The results showed that during 1961-2017, both
   the consecutive wet or dry days decreased significantly, while the
   number of heavy precipitation days had no significant trend, and the
   other seven wet EPIs increased insignificantly. The abrupt change years
   of the 10 EPIs occurred 32 and 40 times from 1963 to 1978 and from 1990
   to 2016, respectively, regardless of sub-region. The extremely dry (or
   wet) events mainly occurred in western (or southwestern) China, implying
   a higher extreme event risk. The extremely wet, normal and extremely dry
   events from 1961 to 2017 occurred in 2016, 1997 and 2011 with empirical
   frequencies of 1.7\%, 50\% and 98.3\%, respectively. In addition, 1998
   was the second-most extremely wet year (empirical frequency was 3.7\%).
   The monthly precipitation values were larger from February to August in
   1998, forming a much earlier flood peak than that of 2016. The 10 EPIs
   had close connections with Normalized Difference Vegetation Indexes
   during the 12 months of 1998 and 2016. This study provides useful
   references for disaster prevention in China.},

Abstract = {The study aims to analyze spatio-temporal variations in rainfall data
   over Indravati River basin, India. Three rainfall data sets, Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis
   (TMPA), India Meteorological Department (IMD) grid, and IMD gauge were
   used. Data from 2001 to 2013 were analyzed for three time scales,
   namely, daily, monthly, and annual. Analysis showed good correlation
   between IMD gauge and TMPA grid rainfall at monthly time scale, poor
   correlation is observed at daily and annual time scales. Mann-Kendall
   (MK) trend test reveals a significant increasing trend of IMD gauge and
   IMD grid data, whereas TMPA rainfall is free from trends at the majority
   of stations for daily time scale. Nevertheless, both IMD grid as well as
   TMPA grid rainfall can be considered as a better representative of
   rainfall, since it is attained from observed rainfall data over the
   country. The Pettitt and standard normal homogeneity tests show that
   TMPA rainfall has a more non-homogeneous nature, whereas IMD grid
   rainfall and IMD gauge rainfall data are homogeneous. Overall, the trend
   and homogeneity analysis indicate that TMPA grid and IMD grid rainfall
   is in line with IMD gauge data, however IMD grid rainfall has the edge
   over TMPA grid data.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Aim of the study
   The objective was the comparison of properties of tests for trend in
   location and scale parameters for hydrological and precipitation time
   series, in particular (i) to review the non-parametric tests known from
   literature for various trends, whereby the tests were studied from the
   point of view of their ability of detecting the existing trend (their
   power); (ii) to study the non-parametric tests for change in scale the
   power of which has not been estimated yet in application to hydrological
   and precipitation series (the Ansari-Bradley (AB), Siegel-Tukey (ST),
   Mood (M) tests); and (iii) to assess the differences between the tests.
   Material and methods
   The study was based on the series of pseudo-numbers and on realizations
   of historical hydrological and precipitation time series. The Monte
   Carlo simulations and comparison of properties of the tests (AB, ST, M)
   that have not been studied yet in application to hydrological and
   precipitation series were conducted. The tests known in literature from
   applications in hydrological and precipitation series methods were also
   compared.
   Results and conclusions
   Results show an increase of the power of the AB, ST and M tests with
   sample length and with strength of the step trend in scale,
   insensitivity to changes in the coefficient of variation, a low
   sensitivity to changes in type of the distribution, and the highest
   power of the M test. The step trend in scale in two exemplary series was
   identified. The AB, ST, and M tests can be applied to verify the
   hypothesis about step trend in scale in hydrological or precipitation
   time series.},

Title = {Recent trends of extreme precipitation indices in the Iberian Peninsula
   using observations and WRF model results},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {10-21},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Spatial and temporal distributions of the trends of extreme
   precipitation indices were analysed between 1986 and 2005, over the
   Iberian Peninsula (IP). The knowledge of the patterns of extreme
   precipitation is important for impacts assessment, development of
   adaptation and mitigation strategies. As such, there is a growing need
   for a more detailed knowledge of precipitation climate change.
   This analysis was performed for Portuguese and Spanish observational
   datasets and results performed by the Weather Research and Forecast
   (WRF) model forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis. Extreme precipitation
   indices recommended by the Expert Team for Climate Change Detection
   Monitoring and Indices were computed, by year and season. Then, annual
   and seasonal trends of the indices were estimated by Theil-Sen method
   and their significance was tested by the Mann-Kendal test. Additionally,
   a second simulation forced by the Max Planck Institute Earth System
   Model (MPI-ESM), was considered. This second modelling configuration was
   created in order to assess its performance when simulating extremes of
   precipitation.
   The annual trends estimated for the 1986-2005, from the observational
   datasets and from the ERA-driven simulation reveal: 1) negative
   statistically significant trends of the CWD index in the Galicia and in
   the centre of the IP; 2) positive statistically significant trends of
   the CDD index over the south of the IP and negative statistically
   significant trends in Galicia, north and centre of Portugal; 3) positive
   statistically significant trends of the R75p index in some regions of
   the north of the IP; 4) positive statistically significant trends in the
   R95pTOT index in the Central Mountains Chain, Leon Mountains and in the
   north of Portugal.
   Seasonally, negative statistically significant trends of the CWD index
   were found in Galicia, in winter and in the south of the IP, in summer.
   Positive statistically significant trends of the CWD index were
   identified in the Leon Mountains, in spring, and in Galicia, in autumn.
   For the CDD index, negative statistically significant trends were seen
   in Valencia, in the spring, and, in Galicia and Portugal (north and
   centre), in summer. Positive statistically significant trends of the CDD
   index were found: in the east of the IP, in the winter; in the
   Cantabrian Mountain, in the spring; and, in the south of the IP, in
   summer. Regarding to the R75p index, negative statistically significant
   trends were found in Galicia, in winter and positive statistically
   significant trends in the north of Portugal, in spring and in the
   Central Mountains Chain and north of Portugal, in autumn. For the
   R95pTOT index, negative statistically significant trends were found over
   the Sierra Cuenca and Sierra Cazorla, in winter and positive
   statistically significant trends were found over the Sierra Cebollera,
   in winter and in Castile-la Mancha region, in spring.
   The results of the annual and seasonal trends of the extreme
   precipitation indices performed for observational datasets and the
   simulation forced by ERA-Interim, are similar. The results obtained for
   the simulation forced by MPI-ESM are not satisfactory, and can be a
   source of criticism for the use of simulation forced by MPI-ESM in this
   type of climate change studies. Even for the relatively short period
   used, the WRF model, when properly forced is a useful tool due to the
   similar results of Portuguese and Spanish observational datasets and the
   simulation forced by ERA-Interim. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The study investigates asphaltene instability trends (ASISTs),
   originally developed by New Mexico Tech, for crude oils with different
   degrees API gravities and asphaltene contents. Different ratios of
   precipitants/solvents have been used to construct the ASISTs at ambient
   conditions. Results were extended to reservoir conditions using routine
   PVT data. The ASIST method was used to predict the asphaltene
   precipitation onset pressure at reservoir conditions. Due to the kinetic
   effect on asphaltene precipitation using the titration method, pressure
   depletion induced asphaltene precipitation experiments were carried out
   for the heavy oil sample. Results, using the modified
   Miller-Flory-Huggins model, were thermodynamically modeled to validate
   the ASIST observations and for finding an appropriate lag time that can
   correspond to reservoir conditions. Similar asphaltene precipitation and
   thermodynamic modeling were adapted from the literature for the light
   oil sample. Results suggest that, for the light oil sample, 5 hours is
   appropriate lag time to perform ASIST, which is in agreement with the
   reported trends; for the heavy oil sample, however, results suggest that
   even a 5 hours lag time is not short enough for the titration experiment
   so that it can be kinetically extended to asphaltene precipitation in
   the reservoir. We suggest a 1 hour lag time for the samples with low
   degrees API gravities and high asphaltene contents. More case studies
   from different crude oils from different geological settings are
   required to draw any rigid kinetic framework for the ASIST.},

Title = {Trends in surface air temperatures, precipitation and combined indices
   in the southeastern Iberian Peninsula (1970-2007)},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-60},
Abstract = {This work evaluates recent (1970-2007) climatic changes in the
   southeastern Iberian Peninsula, a semi-arid region with important human
   pressure. The high-resolution dataset Spain02 (similar to 20 km) was
   used. This allowed us to discover local/regional signals, most of them
   not previously reported because of the use of coarse data or
   interpolation techniques. Annual precipitation has not experienced
   long-term changes in most of the region (80\%) but showed some negative
   trends in the wettest mountainous NW area and slight recovery in the
   most arid S/SE region, mainly due to changes during winter. However, an
   increase in long-term droughts, examined at 4 locations, was found,
   which seems highly connected to a temperature increase. Both maximum and
   minimum temperatures (Tmax, Tmin) have increased in most of the region
   (in 70 and 88\% of the area, respectively) at high rates (average 0.5
   and 0.52 degrees C decade(-1) for Tmax and Tmin, respectively), with
   steepest trends in spring and summer and distinct subregional
   differences. Thus, the diurnal temperature range decreased in the most
   populated areas in the NE and the S/SW (25\% of the region), whereas it
   mainly increased in natural and mountainous areas (15\%). Combined
   indices showed increasing frequency of warm-dry and warm-wet days and
   less cold days, especially in the central W and NE. Precipitation
   intensity increased within warm-wet days in the transition seasons (40\%
   of the region), suggesting enhanced convective events, even where total
   precipitation did not change. Besides large-scale factors, we discuss
   precipitation-temperature feedbacks and land cover changes in the
   analyzed period (i.e. increase in mountainous forested areas, urban and
   agricultural intensification in coastal flatlands), possibly affecting
   the observed signals. Given the relatively low density of long-term
   records from which the Spain02 was built, caution is needed in the
   interpretation of results, especially for temperature in altitude
   gradients.},

Title = {Analysis of trends of annual and seasonal precipitation from 1956 to

Abstract = {The trends of annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation in southern
   China (Guangdong Province) for the period 1956-2000 are investigated,
   based on the data from 186 high-quality gauging stations. Statistical
   tests, including Mann-Kendall rank test and wavelet analysis, are
   employed to determine whether the precipitation series exhibit any
   regular trend and periodicity. The results indicate that the annual
   precipitation has a slightly decreasing trend in central Guangdong and
   slight increasing trends in the eastern and western areas of the
   province. However, all the annual trends are not statistically
   significant at the 95\% confidence level. The average precipitation
   increases in the dry season in central Guangdong, but decreases in the
   wet season, meaning that the precipitation becomes more evenly
   distributed within the year. Furthermore, the analysis of monthly
   precipitation suggests that the distribution of intra-annual
   precipitation changes over time. The results of wavelet analysis show
   prominent precipitation with periods ranging from 10 to 12 years in
   every sub-region in Guangdong Province. Comparing with the sunspot cycle
   (11-year), the annual precipitation in every sub-region in Guangdong
   province correlates with Sunspot Number with a 3-year lag. The findings
   in this paper will be useful for water resources management.},

Title = {Diagnosis of variability and trends in a global precipitation dataset

Abstract = {A physically motivated statistical model is used to diagnose variability
   and trends in wintertime ( October - March) Global Precipitation
   Climatology Project (GPCP) pentad (5-day mean) precipitation.
   Quasi-geostrophic theory suggests that extratropical precipitation
   amounts should depend multiplicatively on the pressure gradient,
   saturation specific humidity, and the meridional temperature gradient.
   This physical insight has been used to guide the development of a
   suitable statistical model for precipitation using a mixture of
   generalized linear models: a logistic model for the binary occurrence of
   precipitation and a Gamma distribution model for the wet day
   precipitation amount.
   The statistical model allows for the investigation of the role of each
   factor in determining variations and long-term trends. Saturation
   specific humidity q(s) has a generally negative effect on global
   precipitation occurrence and with the tropical wet pentad precipitation
   amount, but has a positive relationship with the pentad precipitation
   amount at mid- and high latitudes. The North Atlantic Oscillation, a
   proxy for the meridional temperature gradient, is also found to have a
   statistically significant positive effect on precipitation over much of
   the Atlantic region. Residual time trends in wet pentad precipitation
   are extremely sensitive to the choice of the wet pentad threshold
   because of increasing trends in low-amplitude precipitation pentads; too
   low a choice of threshold can lead to a spurious decreasing trend in wet
   pentad precipitation amounts. However, for not too small thresholds, it
   is found that the meridional temperature gradient is an important factor
   for explaining part of the long-term trend in Atlantic precipitation.},

   precipitation over the La Plata Basin},
Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {11-21},
Abstract = {The paper explores the climatic variability displayed by precipitation
   over the La Plata Basin in South America. Using a 1.0degrees 1at x
   1.0degrees long grid and 18 months of low-pass-filtered anomalies of
   monthly precipitation, a principal component analysis (PCA) was
   performed. The leading 10 spatial principal components were retained for
   a subsequent analysis. The spatial-temporal structure of the trend and
   interannual oscillatory components of precipitation over the whole La
   Plata Basin has been investigated in this study, using the M-SSA
   technique. We present evidence that precipitation has cycles in the IFB,
   with about 6 and 3.5 yr and a quasi-biennial oscillation, together with
   a trend component that explains less than 5\% of the total variance. In
   order to determine if the oscillatory components (in the IFB) detected
   in rainfall are reflected in streamflows, an SSA was applied to the
   series of annual mean discharges corresponding to gauging stations on
   the major rivers of the region. Oscillatory components with dominant
   periods of about 6 and 3.5 yr were found in some rivers. For this
   reason, it could be said that the river behavior in the interannual
   frequency band is a clear reflection of what occurs with precipitation
   over the basin. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Abstract = {Trends in precipitation and surface water chemistry at a network of 15
   small watersheds (<10 km(2)) in the USA were evaluated using a
   statistical test for monotonic trends (the seasonal Kendall test) and a
   graphical smoothing technique for the visual identification of trends.
   Composite precipitation samples were collected weekly and surface water
   samples were collected at least monthly. Concentrations were adjusted
   before trend analysis, by volume for precipitation samples and by flow
   for surface water samples. A relation between precipitation and surface
   water trends was not evident either for individual inorganic solutes or
   for solute combinations, such as ionic strength, at most sites. The only
   exception was chloride, for which there was a similar trend at 60\% of
   the sites. The smoothing technique indicated that short-term patterns in
   precipitation chemistry were not reflected in surface waters. The
   magnitude of the short-term variations in surface water concentration
   was generally larger than the overall long-term trend, possibly because
   flow adjustment did not adequately correct for climatic variability.
   Detecting the relation between precipitation and surface water chemistry
   trends may be improved by using a more powerful sampling strategy and by
   developing better methods of concentration adjustment to remove the
   effects of natural variation in surface waters.},

Abstract = {The precipitation variability and trends were investigated in the
   Usumacinta River Basin (URB) for the period 1959-2018, based on imputed
   and homogenized data records from 60 meteorological stations in Mexico
   and Guatemala. The homogenization process played a crucial role in
   enhancing the quality of the original precipitation series, reducing
   regional inconsistencies and improving temporal and spatial coherence.
   The dataset reliably captured large-scale climate variations, revealing
   three regions with similar precipitation variability and trends in the
   URB. Notably, maximum precipitation occurred at 636 m a.s.l., while
   minimum precipitation was at 1531 m a.s.l., indicating an orographic
   effect in the region. Extreme precipitation events were linked to El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation. Although the Mann-Kendall test showed
   statistically significant negative trends in only 18\% of the stations,
   integration of Sen's slope analysis and 30-year normals and dry year
   occurrences highlighted a progressive shift towards dryer conditions
   throughout the study period in the URB. These drier conditions could
   notably affect regions with higher precipitation, requiring special
   attention due to possible socioeconomic impacts associated with drought
   events. By identifying these vulnerable regions, policymakers and
   stakeholders can proactively plan and execute adaptive measures to
   mitigate the potential impacts of droughts on communities, ecosystems,
   and economic activities within the basin.},

Abstract = {In the past 60 years, the global climate has undergone both rapid
   warming and a brief warming hiatus, while regional precipitation
   patterns in China have also experienced diverse and complex changes.
   Specifically, the factors behind the opposing trends in summer
   precipitation between two adjacent regions -Southwest China and the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau -are particularly intricate. After evaluating the
   historical runs from CMIP6 models, the authors assessed the
   contributions of various external forcing factors that simulated the
   summer precipitation trends observed over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and
   Southwest China from 1961 to 2014. The findings show that, compared to
   other forcing factors, greenhouse gases had a significant impact on the
   increase in summer precipitation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, while
   aerosols played an important role in the decrease in summer
   precipitation in Southwest China.},

Title = {Trends, Cycles, and Spatial Distribution of the Precipitation, Potential
   Evapotranspiration and Aridity Index in Xinjiang, China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Xinjiang is a typical continental arid climate zone and ecologically
   fragile zone. Drought has caused damage to the local social economy,
   agricultural production, and the ecological environment. However, the
   study of drought is more difficult due to the complex topography and the
   lack of monitoring information. In this paper, based on the
   meteorological data of 94 meteorological stations in Xinjiang from 1961
   to 2020, we used the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration
   (ET0) to calculate the aridity index (AI); the Mann-Kendall test, Morlet
   wavelet analysis, and Kriging interpolation were used to identify the
   trend, period, and spatial distribution. The results showed that (1) the
   average change rate of the precipitation in Xinjiang was 8.58 mm/10a,
   the average change rate of the ET0 was -14.84 mm/10a, and the average
   change rate of the AI was -1.94/10a; (2) the periods of precipitation,
   ET0, and AI in Xinjiang were 39, 29, and 14 years, respectively, and the
   abrupt changes occurred in 1986, 1971, and 1987, respectively; (3) The
   Moran index of precipitation and temperature are 0.41 and 0.33,
   respectively, indicating that precipitation and temperature in Xinjiang
   are positively correlated in spatial distribution and have spatial
   clustering characteristics; and the z-values are both greater than 2.58
   (p < 0.01), indicating that the spatial autocorrelation of precipitation
   and temperature in Xinjiang is significant. This study can provide a
   reference for the diagnosis of the meteorological drought mechanism and
   the coping with climate change in Xinjiang.},

Title = {Long-term trends in aerosol and precipitation composition over the
   western North Atlantic Ocean at Bermuda},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {15},
Pages = {8119-8135},
Abstract = {Since the 1980s, emissions of SO2 and NOX (NO+NO2) from anthropogenic
   sources in the United States (US), Canada, and Europe have decreased
   significantly suggesting that the export of oxidized S and N compounds
   from surrounding continents to the atmosphere overlying the North
   Atlantic Ocean (NAO) has also decreased. The chemical compositions of
   aerosols and precipitation sampled daily on Bermuda (32.27 degrees N,
   64.87 degrees W) from 1989 to 1997 and from 2006 to 2009 were evaluated
   to quantify the magnitudes, significance, and implications of associated
   tends in atmospheric composition. The chemical data were stratified
   based on FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) retroplumes into
   four discrete transport regimes: westerly flow from eastern North
   America (NEUS/SEUS); easterly trade-wind flow from northern Africa and
   the subtropical NAO (Africa); long, open-ocean, anticyclonic flow around
   the Bermuda High (Oceanic); and transitional flow from the relatively
   clean open ocean to the polluted eastern North America (North). Based on
   all data, annual average concentrations of non-sea-salt (nss) SO42-
   associated with aerosols and annual volume-weighted-average (VWA)
   concentrations in precipitation decreased significantly (by 22\% and 49
   \%, respectively) whereas annual VWA concentrations of NH4+ in
   precipitation increased significantly (by 70 \%). Corresponding trends
   in aerosol and precipitation NO3- and of aerosol NH4+ were
   insignificant. Nss SO42- in precipitation under NEUS/SEUS and Oceanic
   flow decreased significantly (61\% each) whereas corresponding trends in
   particulate nss SO42- under both flow regimes were insignificant. Trends
   in precipitation composition were driven in part by decreasing emissions
   of SO2 over upwind continents and associated decreases in anthropogenic
   contributions to nss SO42- concentrations. Under NEUS/SEUS and Oceanic
   flow, the ratio of anthropogenic to biogenic contributions to nss SO42-
   in the column scavenged by precipitation were relatively greater than
   those in near surface aerosol, which implies that, for these flow
   regimes, precipitation is a better indicator of overall anthropogenic
   impacts on the lower troposphere. Particulate nss SO42- under African
   flow also decreased significantly (34 \%) whereas the corresponding
   decrease in nss SO42- associated with precipitation was insignificant.
   We infer that these trends were driven in part by reductions in the
   emissions and transport of oxidized S compounds from Europe. The lack of
   significant trends in NO3- associated with aerosols and precipitation
   under NEUS/SEUS flow is notable in light of the large decrease (37 \%)
   in NOX emissions in the US and Canada over the period of record. Rapid
   chemical processing of oxidized N in marine air contributed to this lack
   of correspondence. Decreasing ratios of nss SO42- to NH4+ and the
   significant decreasing trend in precipitation acidity (37 \%) indicate
   that the total amount of acidity in the multiphase gas-aerosol system in
   the western NAO troposphere decreased over the period of record.
   Decreasing aerosol acidities would have shifted the phase partitioning
   of total NH3 (NH3 + particulate NH4+) towards the gas phase thereby
   decreasing the atmospheric lifetime of total NH3 against wet plus dry
   deposition. The trend of increasing NH4+ in precipitation at Bermuda
   over the period of record suggests that NH3 emissions from surrounding
   continents also increased. Decreasing particulate nss SO42- in
   near-surface air under NEUS/SEUS flow over the period of record implies
   that the corresponding shortwave scattering and absorption by nss S and
   associated aerosols constituents also decreased. These changes in
   radiative transfer suggest a corresponding lower limit for net warming
   over the period in the range of 0.1-0.3 W m(-2).},

Title = {Global Precipitation for the Year 2023 and How It Relates to Longer Term
   Variations and Trends},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {In this paper, the global distribution of precipitation for 2023, in
   terms of global totals and regional anomaly patterns, is analyzed using
   information from the new Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP)
   V3.2 Monthly product, including how the precipitation amounts and
   patterns from 2023 fit into the longer record from 1983-2023. The
   tropical pattern of anomalies for 2023 is dominated by the effect of the
   El Nino which began during the Northern Hemisphere spring, after three
   plus years of La Nina conditions. The transition from La Nina conditions
   through 2022 shows the rapid change in many regional features from
   positive to negative anomalies or the reverse. Comparison of the
   observed regional trend maps with climate model results indicates
   similarity between the observations and the model results forced by
   observed SSTs, while the ``free-running{''} model ensemble shows only a
   broad general agreement over large regions. Global total precipitation
   shows about a 3\% range over the span of data, with El Nino and La Nina
   years prominent as positive and negative features, with 2023 showing a
   small positive global anomaly. The ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence
   Zone) latitude band, 0-10 degrees N, sets a record high mean rain rate
   in 2023 after a steady upward trend over the decades, probably a
   response related to global warming.},

Abstract = {The perception of spatio-temporal variability of winter precipitation
   covering dominant water resources and environment over Kashmir Himalaya
   is a pre-eminent perspective under current social interests. The main
   objectives of the study are, firstly, to unriddle the whole (1980-2020)
   and post-2000 trend in the winter season precipitation (WP), frequency
   of low-pressure systems (Lp-S), and western disturbances (WDs) to
   understand the footprints of climate change over the region; secondly,
   to evaluate the spatio-temporal variability of winter precipitation
   under the dominance of global teleconnection indices, using both station
   and reanalysis datasets. Modified Mann-Kendell test and a linear
   regression model were utilized to extract the trend and significance in
   WP, Lp-S, and WDs. The results reveal that WP shows an insignificant
   decreasing trend (1980-2020), with an increasing trend post-2000, while
   a decreasing trend is seen during post-2000 in the frequency of Lp-S and
   WDs. The contribution of WP to annual precipitation shows decadal
   variability with a decreasing trend post-2000. The anatomy of winter
   extreme precipitation days has shown a decreasing trend (1980-2020),
   with a robust coupled increasing trend with WP post-2000. The dynamics
   of ten severe WD-based extreme precipitation events show that a cyclonic
   circulation and trough connects the Arabian Sea and the Himalayas,
   bringing additional moisture to the study region and resulting in
   extreme precipitation. The cogency of global teleconnections on the
   variability of WP shows that a pattern with positive phase of NAO, ENSO,
   and a negative phase in Siberian high intensifies the WD-based
   precipitation. The study discovers its applicability for the regional
   forecast system in predicting the winters.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change caused by global warming can be seen in
   changes of climate variables such as precipitation, humidity, and
   temperatures. These effects of global climate change can be interpreted
   as a result of the examination of meteorological parameters. One of the
   most effective methods to investigate these effects is trend analysis.
   The Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA) method is a trend analysis
   method that has emerged in recent years. The distinctive features of
   this method compared with other trend methods are that it depends on
   time series and can compare data series among themselves. Therefore, in
   this study, the IPTA method was applied to total monthly precipitation
   data of Susurluk Basin, one of Turkey's important basins. Data from ten
   precipitation observation stations in Susurluk Basin were used. Data
   were provided by the General Directorate of State Meteorology Affairs.
   The length of this data series was 12 years (2006-2017). As a result of
   the study, since there is no regular polygon in IPTA graphics of each
   station, it is seen that precipitation data varies by years. While this
   change is seen increasingly at some stations, it is seen decreasingly at
   other stations.},

Abstract = {Since the 1950's-1960's a large portion of Argentina has experienced a
   long period of high precipitation with important changes a 30-year
   period annual averages. Opposite conditions have taken place throughout
   the twentieth century in a large-portion of Chile, with declining
   tendencies in annual precipitations. If such conditions prevail, the
   socio-economic implications of these phenomena could eventually gain
   importance due to the expansion of grain crops in the semi-arid borders
   of Argentina and a decline in the availability of reservoir water used
   for irrigation or energy generation in the central region of Chile and
   western Argentina. An accurate diagnosis of these phenomena is very
   important for applied purposes in medium term planning that should be
   undertaken by private and state-owned companies. These diagnoses are
   also important from a methodological point of view, in order to find out
   whether these changes in long-term averages are constant and represent a
   climatic change or if they are low frequency interdecadal fluctuations
   that would mean a return to opposite conditions. We suggest that the two
   intense La Ni (n) over tildea events that took place during 19881989 and
   1995-1996 caused a decline in the precipitation trends over a large
   region of semi-arid Argentina and intensified droughts in Central Chile.
   A regionalized local precipitation analysis of the 1931-1932/1998-1999
   agricultural periods over large areas was performed. Afterwards,
   long-term variations for homogeneous areas were analysed through their
   non-linear trends and low frequency fluctuations in a regional scale.
   Seven inter-annual patterns with three different types of tendencies
   have been found. One of them shows an increasing linear trend throughout
   the analysed period; another one shows an increasing trend, but also a
   decrease after the 1980's, and a third one shows a continuous decrease.
   Regions with continuous trends include medium latitude semi-arid regions
   in Argentina and Chile, where an intense human impact is observed. An
   18-26-year-quasi-period that affects four of the selected regions and
   has a clearer signal in the Cuyo region has been found. This long period
   signal is in phase with the oscillations of other atmospheric variables
   in South America and with precipitation in South Africa.},

Abstract = {Understanding trends and variability of precipitation is essential to
   improve water resources utilization as well as agricultural activities.
   This study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal trends and variability
   of rainfall in the Modjo watershed, central Ethiopia. The Mann-Kendall
   trend (M-K) test, innovative trend analysis (ITA) and Sen's slope
   estimator were used to determine temporal trends, while the inverse
   distance weighted interpolation technique was adopted to visualize the
   spatial trends in time series. The result showed that complex patterns
   of rainfall variability that range from 16 to 59\%, 18 to 63\%, and 50
   to 90\% for the annual, summer, and spring seasons, respectively was
   observed over the study watershed. The result also indicated that
   significant trend (p < 0.05) in annual rainfall was detected only in
   28.6\% and 42.9\% of the stations under the M-K test and ITA method,
   respectively, which indicates relatively more significant trends are
   displayed by the ITA method than the M-K test. At the seasonal scale,
   positive trends have been more dominant in the summer season (Z > 0,
   SITA > 0), whereas negative trends (Z < 0, SITA < 0) were detected in
   the spring season. Comparatively, the ITA method is found to be robust
   and allows more detailed trend analysis results using graphical
   illustrations for extreme events. The study concludes that the
   increasing and decreasing trends in summer and spring rainfall patterns
   could have implications leading to an increase in extreme events and
   lower agricultural productivity, respectively. The result suggests the
   need for planning effective adaptation strategies at the regional and
   local scales.},

Abstract = {It is certain that globally the troposphere has warmed since the
   industrial revolution because of the greenhouse gas emissions. The water
   vapour content of air increases as the climate warms. However, there is
   nonsignificant long-term trend in global-scale precipitation. This study
   aims to investigate the sources of the uncertainty of the long-term
   precipitation trend under global warming through the water cycle. The
   data of the historical simulations (1850-2005) from 30 CMIP5 models are
   used in the estimate. The p-value is utilized to indicate the
   significance of the long-term trend of the water-vapour-related variable
   in the water cycle as well as the air temperature near surface and at
   the condensation level. For each variable, the p-value is calculated for
   each of the grid points. The overall spatial distribution patterns of
   the p-values are compared between two variables that linked directly,
   and a point-to-point comparison is also performed to the two fields.
   Results show that over the globe, the near-surface specific humidity
   increases significantly at most of the grid points while the increase of
   the specific humidity at the condensation level is significant at some,
   and, however, the long-term trend of the relative humidity at the
   condensation level is majorly nonsignificant. This suggests that as
   assessed from the global grid points, the uncertainty of the long-term
   trend of the water-vapour-related variable enlarges substantially in the
   process of condensation, and modestly in the process of the transport of
   water vapour. Therefore, the uncertainty of the long-term precipitation
   trend under global warming is mainly attributed to the condensation and
   slightly due to the transport of water vapour. The results obtained from
   the 30 models are consistent with each other, which supports the
   reliability of the conclusion.},

Title = {Elevation-Dependent Trends in Precipitation Observed over and around the
   Tibetan Plateau from 1971 to 2017},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) are regions that are most sensitive to climate
   change, especially extreme precipitation changes with elevation, may
   increase the risk of natural disasters and have attracted attention for
   the study of extreme events in order to identify adaptive actions. Based
   on daily observed data from 113 meteorological stations in the Tibetan
   Plateau and the surrounding regions in China during 1971-2017, we
   calculated the annual total precipitation and extreme precipitation
   indices using the R ClimDex software package and explored
   elevation-dependent precipitation trends. The results demonstrate that
   the annual total precipitation increased at a rate of 6.7 mm/decade, and
   the contribution of extreme precipitation to total precipitation
   increased over time, and the climate extremes were enhanced. The annual
   total, seasonal precipitation, and precipitation extreme trends were
   observed in terms of elevation dependence in the Tibetan Plateau (TP)
   and the surrounding area of the Tibetan Plateau (TPS) during 1971-2017.
   There is growing evidence that the elevation-dependent wetting (EDWE) is
   complex over the TP. The trends in total precipitation have a strong
   dependence on elevation, and the EDWE is highlighted by the extreme
   precipitation indices, for example, the number of heavy precipitation
   days (R10) and consecutive wet days (CWD). The dependence of extreme
   precipitation on elevation is heterogeneous, as other extreme indices do
   not indicate EDWE. These findings highlight the precipitation complexity
   in the TP. The findings of this study will be helpful for improving our
   understanding of variabilities in precipitation and extreme
   precipitation in response to climate change and will provide support for
   water resource management and disaster prevention in plateaus and
   mountain ranges.},

Abstract = {Precipitation chemistry measurements are essential to estimate the
   deposition of ionic components that are beneficial or harmful to the
   ecosystems and quantify the wet scavenging of the atmospheric
   constituents. A long-term (2006 to 2016) database of the water-soluble
   inorganic components in the rainwater (RW) at Pune (an urban location)
   and Sinhagad (a high-altitude rural location) in southwest India was
   examined to understand the trends in measured anthropogenic components
   and the factors controlling the chemistry of RW in this region. We
   observed the long-term increasing trends in NH4+ at Pune and SO42-, NO3
   over bar , and NH4+ at Sinhagad. About 10\% of rain samples were acidic
   (below 5.6). Low pH values were generally measured at Pune (8\%) and
   Sinhagad (9\%) stations when the air mass back trajectories (AMBTs)
   originated from land. This study suggests that NO3 over bar plays a
   vital role in acidifying the rain in both the sampling stations, though
   SO42- remains the dominant factor. The high concentrations of Ca2+ and
   NH4+ have played a significant role in neutralizing the acidity of RW.
   The cluster analysis of AMBTs showed that at Pune 74\% and Sinahagd 65\%
   of rain events were associated with oceanic air masses from the Arabian
   Sea.},

Abstract = {Monsoon precipitation is the major driver of agricultural productivity
   in the Myanmar Coast; it is crucial to quantify and understand recent
   changes in precipitation during the monsoon season over this region. By
   using multiple precipitation datasets, we demonstrate that total
   precipitation during monsoon season over the Myanmar Coast has increased
   slightly but not significantly, but precipitation during the onset and
   withdrawal phases of monsoon season exhibit a significant increasing
   trend during 1979-2015, and the contribution of precipitation during the
   two phases to total monsoon precipitation has increased significantly.
   The increased precipitation during the onset phase over the Myanmar
   Coast directly results from the earlier onset of the South Asian Summer
   Monsoon in recent decades, which is associated with the phase transition
   of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in the late 1990s. And the
   precipitation increase during the withdrawal phase is directly due to
   the enhances of the ascending motion and convection around this region,
   which is dynamically correlated to the anomalous cyclone-like
   circulation around the Bay of Bengal as well as the strengthening of the
   cross-equatorial flow around the equatorial Indian Ocean.},

Abstract = {Determination of spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation and
   drought remains a challenge in many arid and semi-arid regions.
   Generally, in these areas, precipitation measurements obtained from
   field stations are few or unreliable. Reanalysis precipitation data has
   opened up new large-scale hydrological application in data-sparse or
   ungauged catchments. This study presents a method based on GIS,
   statistical tests, and satellite-based precipitation for the analysis of
   spatial and temporal precipitation and drought trends. As a case study,
   we used 35 years (1979-2013) of precipitation data from the climate
   forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) for the Mexican state of Durango. For
   trend detection, we used the statistical test of Mann-Kendall at 5\%
   standard precipitation index timescale of 12 months (SPI-12) to analyze
   the spatiotemporal trends of drought, and principal component analysis
   (PCA) was applied to characterize the spatial patterns. In many of the
   grid locations analyzed, the precipitation trends were not statistically
   significant. However, the months within winter and spring, except for
   June, showed a decreasing trend in precipitation, while the months of
   July, August, and September showed an increasing trend. This variation
   in rainfall intensity agrees with the climate pattern reported for this
   region. The frequency of drought events for each month during the period
   of analysis was mapped. The incidence of drought events was higher in
   June and September. Drought events are present all around the state of
   Durango, but they are more frequent in the northern part, in the Sierra
   Madre Occidental, Mapimi, and Laguna regions.},

   three stations in the basin have been analyzed for temporal and spatial
   trends. The methods used include the Mann-Kendall test and simple
   regression analysis. The results show (1) a significant positive trend
   in summer precipitation at many stations especially for June and July,
   with the summer precipitation maxima in the middle and lower Yangtze
   River basin in the 1990s; (2) a positive trend in rainstorm frequency
   that is the main contributor to increased summer precipitation in the
   basin; and (3) a significant positive trend in flood discharges in the
   middle and lower basin related to the spatial patterns and temporal
   trends of both precipitation and individual rainstorms in the last 40
   years. The rainstorms have aggravated floods in the middle and lower
   Yangtze River Basin in recent decades. The observed trends in
   precipitation and rainstorms are possibly caused by variations of
   atmospheric circulation (weakened summer monsoon) under climate warming.

Abstract = {In this study, a framework model (TPEM) for evaluating the temporal and
   spatial variation of urban precipitation is established. TPEM includes
   seven calculation methods at the same time. Taking the annual
   precipitation and flood season precipitation data of 8 meteorological
   stations in Zhengzhou, China from 1960 to 2020 as an example, the trend
   and period of rain island effect in Zhengzhou are analyzed from the
   annual and flood season rainfall scale, and the distance method is
   introduced to quantitatively evaluate the rain island effect. The
   results show that the rain island effect in the central urban area of
   Zhengzhou has an sudden increase trend in 1997 and 2004 respectively,
   and the increasing trend of rain island effect on the scale of annual
   and flood season rainfall lasts for 4 and 10 years respectively; At the
   same time, it has fluctuation periods of 8-10a, 16-18a, 3-5a, 17-20a,
   5-7a, and 2-3a respectively. The rain island effect in Zhengzhou is
   concentrated in the flood season. The research can provide a scientific

Abstract = {The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basin is the world's third
   largest. Literature show that changes in precipitation have a
   significant impact on climate, agriculture, and the environment in the
   GBM. Two satellite-based precipitation products, Precipitation
   Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural
   Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and Multi-Source
   Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), were used to analyze and
   compare precipitation trends over the GBM as a whole and within 34
   pre-defined hydrological sub-basins separately for the period 1983-2019.
   A non-parametric Modified Mann-Kendall test was applied to determine
   significant trends in monsoon (June-September) and pre-monsoon
   (March-May) precipitation. The results show an inconsistency between the
   two precipitation products. Namely, the MSWEP pre-monsoon precipitation
   trend has significantly increased (Z-value = 2.236, p = 0.025), and the
   PERSIANN-CDR monsoon precipitation trend has significantly decreased
   (Z-value = -33.071, p < 0.000). However, both products strongly indicate
   that precipitation has recently declined in the pre-monsoon and monsoon
   seasons in the eastern and southern regions of the GBM river basin,
   agreeing with several previous studies. Further work is needed to
   identify the reasons behind inconsistent decreasing and increasing
   precipitation trends in the GBM river basin.},

Abstract = {In this present work, the daily precipitation data obtained from five
   gauging stations were analyzed to find the trend and prediction of
   precipitation for water deficit area of Wadi Shueib catchment in Jordan.
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test with Sen's slope estimator and innovative trend
   analysis (ITA) were carried out for monthly, average, and seasonal data,
   derived from daily precipitation for a minimum of 44years of record. The
   ITA method detected trend at all stations, in different trend levels
   (low, medium, and high), while MK test detected no trend except at two
   stations during the same period. The Box-Jenkins forecasting method with
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to
   predict the changes in precipitation for projected years. Best-fit ARIMA
   models were found based on diagnostic check procedure in Box-Jenkins
   method. The best-fit ARIMA models, validated with 10years of data
   (2007-2016), were used for predicting precipitation up to 2026, and ITA
   was used to find the trend of precipitation in the future. The future
   trend shows that the high level (heavy rain) is decreasing at all
   stations and low level (normal rain) is increasing, except in the month
   of December, which shows an increasing trend. This observed pattern
   warrants effective water management strategies for already
   water-stressed area of Wadi Shueib catchment in Jordan.},

Title = {Trends in Dryness Index Based on Potential Evapotranspiration and
   Precipitation over 1961-2099 in Xinjiang, China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Under the background of global warming, deep understanding for
   drought-related index is important. The spatial distributions and trends
   in annual mean (AM) climatic data, including P-AM, ETo,AM and DIAM in
   Xinjiang, China, were analyzed. Statistical downscaling model (SDSM) was
   applied. Future P-AM, ETo,AM, and DIAM series were generated and used to
   analyze their temporal trends, along with the historical climatic data.
   The results showed that (1) over 1960-2010, DIAM varied greatly and
   ranged from 1.5 to 479.6. Trends in DIAM decreased significantly. The
   regional climate turned to be from arid to humid in the past; (2) over
   2015-2099, DIAM ranged between 1.9 and 198.5 under A2 scenario and 1.6
   and 130.4 under B2 scenario. Trends in DIWR decreased insignificantly
   under A2 scenario and significantly under B2 scenario, indicating a weak
   drought stress from the future climate; (3) the modified Mann-Kendal
   (MKK) test generally decreased the significance of the trends because it
   considered the limitation of serial autocorrelation. Robust trend test
   of MMK method was recommended considering its rigor property. In
   conclusion, the drought in Xinjiang tends to be relieved over 2015-2099
   compared to 1960-2010.},

Title = {Temporal change of spatial heterogeneity and its effect on regional
   trend of annual precipitation heterogeneity indices},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {18},
Pages = {3178-3190},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {A statistical test on climate and hydrological series from different
   spatial resolution could obtain different regional trend due to spatial
   heterogeneity and its temporal variability. In this study, annual series
   of the precipitation heterogeneity indices of concentration index (CI)
   and the number of wet days (NW) along with annual total amount of
   precipitation were calculated based on at-site daily precipitation
   series during 1962-2011 in the headwater basin of the Huaihe River,
   China. The regional trends of the indices were first detected based on
   at-site series by using the aligned and intrablock methods, and field
   significance tests that consider spatial heterogeneity over sites. The
   detected trends were then compared with the trends of the regional index
   series derived from daily areal average precipitation (DAAP), which
   averages at-site differences and thus neglects spatial heterogeneity. It
   was found that the at-site-based regional test shows increasing trends
   of CI and NW in the basin, which follows the test on individual sites
   that most of sites were characterized by increasing CI and NW. However,
   the DAAP-derived regional series of CI and NW were tested to show a
   decreasing trend. The disparity of the regional trend test on
   at-site-based regional series and the DAAP-derived regional series
   arises from a temporal change of the spatial heterogeneity, which was
   quantified by the generalized additive models for location, scale, and
   shape. This study highlights that compared with averaging indices,
   averaging at-site daily precipitation could lead to an error in the
   regional trend inference on annual precipitation heterogeneity indices.
   More attention should be paid to temporal variability in spatial
   heterogeneity when data at large scales are used for regional trend
   detection on hydro-meteorological events associated with intra-annual
   heterogeneity.},

Abstract = {The generation of drug supersaturation close to the absorptive site is
   an important mechanism of how several formulation technologies enhance
   oral absorption and bioavailability. Lipid-based formulations belong to
   the supersaturating drug delivery systems although this is not the only
   mechanism of how drug absorption is promoted in vivo. Different methods
   to determine drug supersaturation and precipitation from lipid-based
   formulations are described in the literature. Experimental in vitro
   setups vary according to their complexity and proximity to the in vivo
   conditions and, therefore, some tests are used for early formulation
   screening, while others better qualify for a later stage of development.
   The present commentary discusses this rapidly evolving field of in vitro
   testing with a special focus on the advancements in analytical
   techniques and new approaches of mechanistic modeling. The importance of
   considering a drug absorption sink is particularly emphasized. This
   commentary should help formulators in the pharmaceutical industry as
   well as in academia to make informed decisions on how to conduct in
   vitro tests for lipid-based delivery systems and to decide on the
   implications of experimental results.},

Abstract = {Effect of climate change in a region can be characterised by the
   analysis of rainfall trends. In the present research, monthly rainfall
   trends at Limbang River Basin (LRB) in Sarawak, Malaysia for a period of
   45years (1970-2015) were characterised through the non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall and Spearman's Rho tests and relative seasonality index.
   Statistically processed monthly rainfall of 12 well distributed rain
   gauging stations in LRB shows almost equal amount of rainfall in all
   months. Mann-Kendall and Spearman's Rho tests revealed a specific
   pattern of rainfall trend with a definite boundary marked in the months
   of January and August with positive trends in all stations. Among the
   stations, Limbang DID, Long Napir and Ukong showed positive (increasing)
   trends in all months with a maximum increase of 4.06mm/year (p=0.01) in
   November. All other stations showed varying trends (both increasing and
   decreasing). Significant (p=0.05) decreasing trend was noticed in Ulu
   Medalam and Setuan during September (-1.67 and -1.79mm/year) and October
   (-1.59 and -1.68mm/year) in Mann-Kendall and Spearman's Rho tests.
   Spatial pattern of monthly rainfall trends showed two clusters of
   increasing rainfalls (maximas) in upper and lower part of the river
   basin separated with a dominant decreasing rainfall corridor. The
   results indicate a generally increasing trend of rainfall in Sarawak,
   Borneo.},

Abstract = {The Mann-Kendall test, composite analysis, and 68 high-quality
   meteorological stations were used to explore the spatiotemporal
   variations and causes of precipitation extremes over the Yellow River
   basin (YRB) during the period of 1960-2011. Results showed that (a) the
   YRB is characterized by decreases of most precipitation indices,
   excluding the simple daily intensity index, which has increasing trends
   in most locations, suggesting that the intensity of rainfall and the
   probability of occurrence of droughts have increased during the last
   decades. (b) Trends of extreme precipitation show mixed patterns in the
   lower reach of the YRB, where drought-flood disasters have increased.
   The increases in heavy rainfall and decreases in consecutive wet days in
   recent years over the northwestern portions of the YRB indicate that the
   intensity and frequency of above-normal precipitation have been trending
   upward in domains. In the central-south YRB, the maximum 1-day
   precipitation (RX1day) and precipitation on extremely wet days (R99p)
   have significantly increased, whereas the number of consecutive dry days
   has declined; these trends suggest that the intensity of precipitation
   extremes has increased in those regions, although the frequency of
   extreme and total rainfall has decreased. (c) The spatial distributions
   of seasonal trends in RX1day and maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5day)
   exhibited less spatial coherence, and winter is becoming the wettest
   season regionwide, particularly over the central-south YRB. (d) There
   were multiple and overlapping cycles of variability for most
   precipitation indices, indicating variations of time and frequency. (e)
   Elevation is intimately correlated with precipitation indices, and a
   weakening East Asian summer monsoon during 1986-2011 compared to that in
   1960-1985 may have played an important role in the declines in most
   indices over the YRB. Therefore, the combined effects from local and
   teleconnection forcing factors have collectively influenced the
   variations in precipitation extremes across the YRB. This study may
   provide valuable evidence for the effective management of water
   resources and the conduct of agricultural activities at the basin scale.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on precipitation has received a great deal
   of attention by scholars worldwide. Efforts have been made in this study
   to find out trends in terms of intensity and duration of precipitation
   for different altitudes and ranges in Western Himalaya region
   representing Jammu \& Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. In terms of
   intensity, precipitation has been classified as Low, Medium and Heavy.
   Durations of precipitation are classified as prolonged dry days (PDD),
   short dry days (SDD), prolonged wet days (PWD) and short wet days (SWD).
   Analysis indicates significant positive trends for low and heavy
   precipitation events and negative for medium precipitation events in
   Pir-Panjal range. For Shamshawari and Great Himalaya ranges, there is no
   significant trend for low, medium and heavy precipitation events. In
   terms of altitude, significant positive trends in low precipitation
   events have been observed for lower and middle altitudes and no
   significant trend has been found for medium and heavy precipitation
   events for other altitudes. In terms of duration, PDD/SDD shows
   significant increasing/decreasing trends for all ranges and altitudes.
   PWD and SWD show decreasing and increasing trends alternatively but not
   significant for all ranges and altitudes. For this study, the widely
   accepted Mann-Kendall test was run at 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001
   significance levels on time series data for the time period, 1991 to
   2016.},

Abstract = {Precipitation anomalies have greatly affected eco-hydrological processes
   in the upper reach of the Mekong River. In this research, an integrated
   spatiotemporal decomposition analysis method was proposed for the
   identification of precipitation trends under climate change at the basin
   scale. This method was a comprehensive use of multiple environmental
   statistical analysis approaches, including the S-mode empirical
   orthogonal function analysis, the inverse distance weighted
   interpolation, the Mann-Kendall trend test, the linear regression and
   the weighted moving average. Results indicated that precipitation trends
   were mainly obtained by two spatial-temporal variation patterns
   resulting from the decomposition of the original precipitation field.
   The primary spatial pattern (more than 40\% variances) indicated that
   the annual and seasonal precipitation in the entire basin had a common
   variation trend. Moreover, variability of precipitation increased to the
   largest in the central basin and gradually decreased from north to
   south. Accordingly, precipitation-sensitive areas were mainly located in
   the east-central basin. The associated temporal trends showed that
   annual precipitation increased slightly over 1960-2009, and decreased
   significantly at the 5\% significance level since 2000. Spring
   precipitation increased significantly over the entire study period. The
   secondary spatial pattern extracted at least 15\% of the variance and
   represented a north-south inverse-variation trend. The northern
   mountainous region was more sensitive to climate change. Temporal trend
   analysis showed that annual precipitation had an increasing trend in the
   northern region and a decreasing trend in the southern region.
   Precipitation in the northern region increased significantly at the 1\%
   significance level in winter. The research results could form a basis
   for supporting basin-scale water resources management, especially in the
   mountainous basin. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Observed precipitation in the Parana-Plata hydrological basin: long-term
   trends, extreme conditions and ENSO teleconnections},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {The Parana-Plata basin is the second largest hydrological basin in South
   America and is of great importance for the countries of the region
   (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). The present study
   focuses on the long-term trends in basin-scale precipitation with
   special emphasis on the role of distribution changes in extreme
   large-scale precipitation events and on the characteristics and
   evolution of ENSO teleconnections over the last 50 years. First, we
   defined a Parana-Plata basin total precipitation index ( PTPI) as the
   precipitations spatially averaged over the hydrological basin. On
   interannual time scales, such an index is mainly representative of
   anomalous monsoon precipitations in the northern part of the basin and
   large convective precipitation anomalies in the center of the basin
   (Paraguay-southern Brazil-Uruguay-northern Argentina) typical of the
   canonical ENSO teleconnection pattern. Our major findings clearly
   highlight a positive trend in yearly averaged PTPI mainly from the late
   1960s to the early 1980s with a strong dependence from month-to-month.
   The largest precipitation increase is observed from November to May in
   southern Brazil and Argentina. A close examination of PTPI distributions
   during the two halves of the period 1950-2001 shows that the changes in
   the mean state from 1950-1975 to 1976-2001 result from significant
   changes in each calendar month mean state and in the tails of the PTPI
   anomaly distributions in May with lesser and weaker large-scale dry
   events and stronger large-scale wet events. Further studies will be
   needed to assess whether the observed trend in large-scale extreme
   precipitation conditions can be related to natural climate variability
   or anthropogenic activities and whether it is associated to changes in
   local/regional extreme events. The stronger wet conditions in different
   months seem to be associated to changes in ENSO characteristics (
   amplitude, propagation, spatial structure, ...) since the 1982-1983 El
   Nino. Indeed, spatial ENSO teleconnections ( stronger in November and
   April-May) have greatly evolved from 1950-1975 to 1976-2001. Moreover,
   we demonstrate that there is a strong modulation and displacement of the
   teleconnection patterns from one event to another, impeding the
   definition of robust statistical relationship between ENSO and
   precipitation in the Parana-Plata basin (except maybe over a very
   limited area near the common border between Paraguay, Argentina and
   Brazil). Finally, the non-antisymmetrical patterns of precipitation
   between El Nino and La Nina conditions and the non-linear relationship
   between precipitation and either Nino3.4 or Nino1+2 sea surface
   temperature indices show that linear statistical forecast systems are
   actually of very limited use for impact predictions on society on a
   local or regional scale.},

Title = {Precipitation variations in the Tai Lake Basin from 1971 to 2018 based
   on innovative trend analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {139},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Precipitation is an important variable affecting regional climate
   characteristics. Accurately identifying trends in precipitation is
   essential for understanding the evolution of the water cycle in the
   context of climate change. This study uses an innovative trend analysis
   (ITA), an innovative polygon trend analysis (IPTA), and wavelet analysis
   to analyze precipitation at multiple timescales (annual, seasonal, and
   monthly), and the influencing factors at 30 meteorological stations in
   the Tai Lake Basin (TLB) from 1971 to 2018. The main conclusions are as
   follows: 1) the annual precipitation had a significantly increasing
   trend, while high precipitation had the largest increasing trend,
   leading to a further increase in the flood risk in the TLB. The
   precipitation trend mainly decreased in spring and autumn, whereas it
   mainly increased in summer and winter. Precipitation in different months
   played crucial but varying roles in the corresponding seasons; there was
   a sharp transition trend from August to September, whereas the
   transition from January to February was relatively stable. 2) There was
   a complex nonlinear relationship between precipitation and atmospheric
   teleconnection. The dominant tele-correlation alone could not explain
   the relationship between precipitation and large-scale circulation. The
   highest percentage of significant power includes the optimal combination
   of variables meant to explain the precipitation variations. 3) The
   detection results from the ITA method and classic trend analysis methods
   (Linear regression analysis, Mann Kendall, and Modified Mann Kendall)
   were consistent; the non-monotonic trends masked by these methods were
   detectable. IPTA can systematically identify consecutive seasons and
   monthly transition characteristics as a supplement to ITA. This study
   can, therefore, provide a reference for water resource management and
   the prevention and control of droughts and floods.},

Abstract = {The trends in changing the content of sulfur and nitrogen in atmospheric
   precipitation in the territory of Minsk over an 18-year period are
   characterized on the basis of the analysis of the monitoring results of
   the chemical composition of atmospheric precipitation at the
   experimental site. A downtrend in the sulfur and nitrogen content
   combined with an uptrend in the precipitation acidity was identified. An
   average decrease (trend) in the content of sulfur in atmospheric
   precipitation for 2002-2019 was 0.019 mg S/dm(3)/year, of oxidized
   nitrogen - 0.008 mg/dm(3), of reduced nitrogen - 0.019 mg/dm(3). Over an
   18-year period, the changes in the content of sulfur and nitrogen in
   atmospheric precipitation decreased the deposition of sulfur on average
   by 31.3 kg/km(2)/year, of oxidized nitrogen - by 15.4 kg/km(2)/year, of
   reduced nitrogen - by 25.6 kg/km(2)/year. It is shown that for the
   period from 2005 to 2012, the acidification potential of the natural
   environment decreased parallel to the reduction of the sulfur and
   nitrogen deposition; in the subsequent period, the trend of the
   acidification potential basically follows the trend of the precipitation
   of the main cations. It is revealed that the rates of average reduction
   in the content of oxidized sulfur and oxidized nitrogen in atmospheric
   precipitation in Minsk for the period from 2002 to 2017 are comparable
   to the rates of reduction of these compounds at the stations of the EMEP
   Program in Europe, and exceed those for reduced nitrogen.},

Title = {Observed Quantile Features of Summertime Temperature Trends over China:
   Non-Negligible Role of Temperature Variability},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Changes in temperature variability can have more serious social and
   ecological impacts than changes in the mean state of temperature,
   especially when they are concurrent with global warming. The present
   study examines the summertime temperatures' trends over China from the
   quantile perspective. Through fully investigating the quantile trends
   (QTs) of the maximum (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) using the
   homogenized observation data and quantile regression analysis, we
   identify evident region-specific quantile features of summertime
   temperature trends. In most of northern China, the QTs in Tmax and Tmin
   for all percentiles generally show strong uniform warmings, which are
   dominated by a warm shift in mean state temperatures. In contrast, the
   QTs of Tmax in the Yangtze River Basin show distinguishable
   inter-quantile features, i.e., an increasing tendency of QTs from
   cooling trends in the lower percentile to warming trends in the higher
   percentile. Further investigations show that such robust growing QTs of
   Tmax across quantiles are dominated by the temperature variance. Our
   results highlight that more attention should be paid to the
   region-specific dominance of temperature variability in trends and the
   related causes.},

Title = {Insights into the Current Trends in the Utilization of Bacteria for
   Microbially Induced Calcium Carbonate Precipitation},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Nowadays, microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) has
   received great attention for its potential in construction and
   geotechnical applications. This technique has been used in
   biocementation of sand, consolidation of soil, production of
   self-healing concrete or mortar, and removal of heavy metal ions from
   water. The products of MICP often have enhanced strength, durability,
   and self-healing ability. Utilization of the MICP technique can also
   increase sustainability, especially in the construction industry where a
   huge portion of the materials used is not sustainable. The presence of
   bacteria is essential for MICP to occur. Bacteria promote the conversion
   of suitable compounds into carbonate ions, change the microenvironment
   to favor precipitation of calcium carbonate, and act as precipitation
   sites for calcium carbonate crystals. Many bacteria have been discovered
   and tested for MICP potential. This paper reviews the bacteria used for
   MICP in some of the most recent studies. Bacteria that can cause MICP
   include ureolytic bacteria, non-ureolytic bacteria, cyanobacteria,
   nitrate reducing bacteria, and sulfate reducing bacteria. The most
   studied bacterium for MICP over the years is Sporosarcina pasteurii.
   Other bacteria from Bacillus species are also frequently investigated.
   Several factors that affect MICP performance are bacterial strain,
   bacterial concentration, nutrient concentration, calcium source
   concentration, addition of other substances, and methods to distribute
   bacteria. Several suggestions for future studies such as CO2
   sequestration through MICP, cost reduction by using plant or animal
   wastes as media, and genetic modification of bacteria to enhance MICP
   have been put forward.},

Abstract = {There is a high-risk attendant on the changes in precipitation in
   developing countries, for example, Gaza Strip (GS). These changes have
   far-reaching social and economic ramifications by causing devastating
   flash floods and droughts. Based on the daily precipitation observations
   of eight meteorological stations over GS, from 1974 to 2016, the trends
   of 11 extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) were estimated using linear
   least squares method and then assessed statistically by Mann-Kendall
   test. The results show that, on average, most of the indices exhibited
   increasing trends during 1974-2016. It includes total wet-day
   precipitation (PRCPTOT), simple daily intensity index (SDII), and max
   1-day precipitation (RX1day). Others were the max 5-day precipitation
   (RX5day), very wet day precipitation (R95p), extremely wet day
   precipitation (R99p), number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm), number
   of very heavy precipitation days (R20mm), and the number of consecutive
   dry days (CDD). Three of these indices passed the significance test
   (with p < .05): RX1day, RX5day, and R95p. Other EPIs, including number
   of wet days (R1mm) and consecutive wet days (CWD), exhibited
   non-significant decreasing trends. Spatially, many stations over GS
   exhibited opposite trends, especially in R1mm and CDD; however, they are
   separated by a few kilometres. Moreover, all EPIs have significant
   positive correlations with PRCPTOT at the 99\% confidence level, except
   CDD (trend was non-significant). The contribution of extreme
   precipitation to annual PRCPTOT exhibited an increasing trend, which was
   significant at 62\% of GS stations. The study indicates a potential
   increase in summer (drought) season.},

Abstract = {Hydroclimatic trend assessments of one of the rural, agricultural,
   non-snow-fed watersheds - the Jhikhu Khola Watershed (JKW) - in Nepal
   using a non-parametric trend estimation method (Mann-Kendall, Spearman's
   rho, and modified Mann-Kendall for autocorrelated data) showed that
   annual average, maximum, and minimum flows are increasing. This trend of
   increasing flow is also seen in the annual average flow measured by one
   of the river gauging stations in the river basin that the watershed
   drains into, and is corroborated by Seasonal Kendall Test as well. This
   increase in streamflow coincides with the increasing rainfall trend of
   the yearly monsoon (June-September) and pre-monsoon (March-May) periods.
   The post-monsoon (October-February) period does not show any statistical
   trend. No consistent trend is observed in temperature changes for the
   whole watershed. Apparently there is no paradox in terms of scale
   (watershed and basin) and consistency between rainfall and runoff trends
   in this watershed. However, lack of a consistent trend in temperature
   changes in the study area may indicate a greater effect from local
   climatic control than global change on temperature. The lack of shift in
   the peak month of streamflow in this non-snow-fed watershed may also
   indicate that there are no major changes in the arrival of monsoon
   patterns in the study area. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Regional variation of drought parameters and long-term trends over India
   using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {296},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Analysing historical drought pattern is vital for implementation of
   efficient drought adaptation and mitigation policies. In this study, we
   examined the meteorological drought characteristics of India during
   1901-2015, using Climate Research Unit (CRU) based Standardized
   Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at multiple timescales
   i.e., 1 month (SPEI01), 3 month (SPEI03), 6 month (SPEI06), 12 month
   (SPEI12). Here, we applied Kmeans clustering algorithm on SPEI12
   (December) to find out different clusters with distinct drought
   characteristics. The six different homogeneous regions, i.e., cluster1
   (C1), cluster2 (C2), cluster3 (C3), cluster4 (C4), cluster5 (C5), and
   cluster6 (C6) identified by K mean clustering largely resemble with the
   clusters mentioned in previous researches. Different drought parameters
   (duration, frequency, intensity) have been also analysed for each
   cluster on a monthly, seasonal and interannual basis. The study
   indicates that northern part of India (C6, C3) experienced frequent
   droughts at shorter timescales whereas the western (C2) and north
   eastern (C4) part of the country encountered frequent drought
   occurrences at longer timescale. It is worthy to mention that the C2
   region comprising the semi-arid and arid western part of the country
   including the great Indian desert, is vulnerable to frequent, prolonged
   and severe droughts at longer timescale (SPEI12). The study revealed a
   significant regional variation in drought trends identified by Modified
   Mann-Kendall (MMK) trend test. The annual trend analysis shows
   statistically significant (p < 0.05) increasing drought trend over C3
   and C4 regions comprising the fertile Gangetic and Brahmaputra plains.
   The seasonal MMK trend analysis reveals significant increase (p < 0.05)
   in droughts over C3 (-0.006) and C4 (-0.005) during monsoon. The
   increasing drought trend over the Gangetic plain (C3) is prominent
   especially in the months of July (p < 0.05, slope = -0.005) and August
   (p < 0.001, slope = -0.006). The study provides a region-specific
   understanding of drought characteristics and long-term trends crucial
   for preparing adaptive strategies to minimize the cumulative impacts of
   droughts.},

Title = {Variable-Sized Cluster Analysis for 3D Pattern Characterization of
   Trends in Precipitation and Change-Point Detection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {A novel analysis procedure, referred to as variable-sized cluster
   analysis (VSCA), was developed to identify trends and change points in
   precipitation time series data set. The procedure involved station-scale
   rainfall data of 100 years from seven districts (Saharanpur, Bareilly,
   Agra, Jhansi, Lucknow, Varanasi, and Gorakhpur) of the state of Uttar
   Pradesh (UP), India. In contrast with the traditional Mann-Kendall (MK)
   test that yields a monotonic trend for the whole span of time, VSCA
   enables one to detect multiple change points while characterizing the
   pattern of precipitation trends over the historical time period. The
   Pettitt-Mann-Whitney (PMW) test was also modified to graphically
   represent the multiple change points, which confirmed the results of
   VSCA. Thus, VSCA demonstrated the unified strength of MK and PMW tests.
   The three-dimensional (3D) figures drawn for visualizing the changing
   trend of precipitation utilized 100-year-long time series data set with
   the minimum size of data cluster as 10, which resulted in the right
   triangular shape of the graphs due to the repeated application of the MK
   test to variable-sized data clusters. Application of VSCA showed a
   decreasing trend of precipitation over Lucknow, Gorakhpur, and Varanasi
   around 1990 onward, with major changes in the decades of 1970-1980.
   Saharanpur and Agra contrarily displayed an increasing trend until 1940
   and no trend thereafter; however, Bareilly and Jhansi showed reducing
   trends in precipitation. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Bulk precipitation and,stream water in a small, undisturbed. forested
   watershed in southwestern British Columbia were sampled regularly and

   entire 1972-2008 time period. Precipitation has exhibited a decline in
   electrical conductivity, a decline in NH4, inorganic-N and total-N
   concentrations and fluxes since the 1980s, an increase in a decline in
   acid H fluxes since similar to 1990. and a decrease in SO4
   concentrations and fluxes from 1980 until the late 1990s. Streamwater
   has exhibited an increase in NO2 concentrations' and fluxes until the
   late 1990s, an increase in pH and decrease in acid H fluxes since the
   early 1990s, a decrease in SO4 concentrations and fluxes from similar to
   1980 until similar to 2000, and increases in Na and Cl concentrations
   and fluxes until similar to 2000. Critical precipitation SO4 and
   inorganic-N loads have probably been exceeded for most years. East Ck.
   watershed has continuously experienced net inflows of all forms of N and
   acid H, and net outflows of dissolved Si, Na. Mg. and Ca. Net of
   inorganic forms of N and total-N have decreased since the early 1980s.
   Net acid H inflows have decreased since the early 1990s, while net Na
   and Cl outflows increased until similar to 2000. The contribution of
   nutrient cycling processes within the watershed to the changes is
   currently unknown.},

Title = {Trends in flash flood events versus convective precipitation in the
   Mediterranean region: The case of Catalonia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {541},
Number = {A, SI},
Pages = {24-37},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential relationship between
   flash flood events and convective precipitation in Catalonia, as well as
   any related trends. The paper starts with an overview of flash floods
   and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their
   associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of,
   and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the
   paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is
   a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation
   from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996-2011) but more
   extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation.
   Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective
   contribution to rainfall, introducing the beta parameter as the ratio
   between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any
   period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA
   database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of
   finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood
   data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as
   a Multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been
   caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or
   exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events.
   The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values, of
   precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert
   Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point
   to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in
   land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was
   concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain
   this positive trend in flash flood events. The beta parameter has been
   also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the
   features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short
   and local events, usually with daily beta values above 0.5, while the
   minimum threshold of daily beta for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.

Title = {Expansion of the northern hemisphere subtropical high pressure belt:
   trends and linkages to precipitation and drought},
Journal = {PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {174-187},
Abstract = {A critical issue in research concerning long-term climate change is the
   relationship between circulation features and global temperature
   variations. We establish that the annual areal size of the northern
   hemisphere subtropical high pressure belt (SHPB), as defined by seven
   500-hPa height isohypses, shares over 70\% of the variability with
   global annual near-surface air temperature since 1948. The area enclosed
   by the 5850-m isohypse of the 500-hPa surface in the northern hemisphere
   has more than doubled since the 1950s, with greatest increases over
   northern Africa, the Middle East and India. A long-term historical run
   of a coupled global climate model shows rapidly increasing SHPB annual
   sizes, since the mid-1970s. Since the SHPB's descending air produces
   increased aridity, SHPB expansion may transition humid regions to more
   arid lands. To examine this aspect, first, variations in recorded
   precipitation using a gridded database for the region experiencing
   expansion of the SHPB show a decrease in precipitation (though
   significant only at the 88\% confidence level) over the last 60 years.
   Second, variations in a 0.5 degrees spatial resolution monthly drought
   index, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, are
   highly correlated (+0.78) with annual variations in the area enclosed by
   the 500-hPa height isohypses. These results support those of previous
   investigations that suggest further northward expansion of the northern
   hemisphere subtropical dry zones with continued global climate change.},

Abstract = {We describe the nature of recent (50 year) rainfall variability in the
   summer rainfall zone, South Africa, and how variability is recognised
   and responded to on the ground by farmers. Using daily rainfall data and
   self-organising mapping (SOM) we identify 12 internally homogeneous
   rainfall regions displaying differing parameters of precipitation
   change. Three regions, characterised by changing onset and timing of
   rains, rainfall frequencies and intensities, in Limpopo, North West and
   KwaZulu Natal provinces, were selected to investigate farmer perceptions
   of, and responses to, rainfall parameter changes. Village and household
   level analyses demonstrate that the trends and variabilities in
   precipitation parameters differentiated by the SOM analysis were clearly
   recognised by people living in the areas in which they occurred. A range
   of specific coping and adaptation strategies are employed by farmers to
   respond to climate shifts, some generic across regions and some
   facilitated by specific local factors. The study has begun to understand
   the complexity of coping and adaptation, and the factors that influence
   the decisions that are taken.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the long-term trends of precipitation (amount, days
   and intensity) in China during the last 50 years, based on the long-term
   precipitation data from 678 meteorological stations. Using the annual
   observed data at the main hydrometric stations on China's four largest
   rivers, the response of river discharge to climate change is analysed
   using linear regression methodology. It was found that the annual
   precipitation in the past 50 years has had a noticeably regional
   dependence. A general rising trend for annual precipitation appears at
   most stations in the west of China (west of longitude 103 degrees E);
   the same increasing trend occurs in southeast China (in the lower
   reaches of the Yangtze River, the Huaihe River watershed and Zhujiang
   River watershed) and in the western part of northeast China. However, a
   decreasing trend appears in the middle part of east China and its
   surrounding regions. The number of precipitation days display a marked
   decrease in east China, with positive trends in west China. An
   increasing trend in the daily-averaged precipitation intensity is found
   in most regions. Such climate change is probably a benefit, easing the
   drought situation in northwest China. It was found that the river
   discharge in these regions is increasing markedly. However, the increase
   of precipitation intensity may lead to a frequent occurrence of floods.
   The negative trend in precipitation in the semiarid middle part of east
   China and the positive trend in rainy southeast China bring adverse
   effects, causing more droughts in the middle of eastern China, and more
   floods in southeastern China. The serious cut-off of flow during the
   1990s in the Yellow River and the frequent flood disasters of the
   Yangtze River during the last 10 years are the results of precipitation
   change.},

Abstract = {This study used a dataset of 30 years (1990-2020) of daily observations
   from 24 meteorological stations in the northern highlands of Pakistan to
   assess trends in extreme precipitation indices. The RClimDex model was
   used to analyze the indices, and the Modified Mann-Kendal test and the
   Theil-Sen slope estimator were applied to determine trends and slopes,
   respectively. The results showed a significant decrease in total annual
   precipitation amount (PRCPTOT) with varying rates of negative trend from
   -4.44 mm/year to -19.63 mm/year. The total winter and monsoon
   precipitation amounts were also decreased during the past three decades.
   The intensity-based precipitation indices (RX1Day, RX5Day, R95p, R99p,
   and SDII) showed a significant decrease in extreme intensity events over
   time, while the count of consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet
   days (CWD) indicated a significant decrease in duration at multiple
   stations. The annual counts of days with precipitation more than or
   equal to 10 mm (R10), 20 mm (R20), and 25 mm (R25) exhibited a
   significant decrease in frequency of extreme precipitation events, with
   the decrease more pronounced in the northern parts of the study domain.
   The findings of this study indicate a significant decline in the
   intensity, frequency, and extent of precipitation extremes across the
   northern highlands of Pakistan over the past 30 years.},

Title = {Trends of nutrients and metals in precipitation in northern Germany: the
   role of emissions and meteorology},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We analyzed the precipitation chemistry for a maritime region in
   northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein) from 1997 to 2017 in order to
   reveal temporal and spatial patterns and to evaluate the role of
   meteorological factors relative to emission reductions in Germany and
   Europe. Therefore, we applied several statistical methods such as time
   series decomposition, principal component, and redundancy analysis. We
   extracted two main groups: (i) a marine group (Cl, Na, Mg) that was
   related to natural processes like sea spray input and (ii) an
   anthropogenic group (Pb, Cd, As, Zn, and nitrogen species) with a
   terrestrial subgroup (Fe, Al, Mn), which were both related to emissions.
   These groups were valid for the spatial, seasonal, and annual trend
   data. Other elements, like Ca, K, total P, and sulfate, were influenced
   by natural and anthropogenic processes. The seasonal variation of
   ammonium deposition was caused primarily by ammonia emissions and
   ancillary by precipitation. Most heavy metals as well as sulfate,
   nitrate, and ammonium showed decreasing trends in concentrations and
   deposition fluxes. Only Hg did not show any trend. The decreasing
   depositions of sulfate and total nitrogen were correlated to emission
   reductions in Germany. The deposition of most heavy metals was
   influenced by emission reductions on European scale and meteorological
   factors such as wind speed and humidity. Hg did not show any correlation
   with the emission time series in Europe. Instead, it was correlated to
   the NAO index and wind, implying that global emissions and transport
   pathways determine the temporal development of Hg depositions. Overall,
   the study reveals that emission reductions positively influence regional
   depositions for most investigated substances. The regional spatial
   patterns of depositions were also influenced by local meteorological
   factors.},

Title = {Trends and behaviour of meteorological drought (1901-2008) over Indian
   region using standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index},

Abstract = {Monthly gridded (0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees) standardized
   precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) data of 1901-2008 were
   used to detect spatial pattern of temporal trend in meteorological
   drought during the Indian summer monsoon period. The SPEI data were
   converted into drought duration, magnitude and types of occurrence to
   capture overall drought scenario. A non-parametric (Mann-Kendall test)
   method was used to test for monotonic trend at each grid level, whereas
   the magnitude was estimated using Sen's method. Further, a field
   significance test was performed at major meteorological regions level to
   assess whether the individual trends identified could occur by chance in
   an analysis of large number of time series analysed. Significant (=0.05)
   increasing trend of both drought duration and magnitude during the
   monsoon was found over parts of eastern, central and north-eastern
   region of India, whereas the parts of west coast, arid western region
   and north India showed significantly decreasing trend. The trends in
   mid- as well as late-season drought were contributing towards
   significant increase in drought condition, whereas trends in
   early-season drought were responsible for decrease in drought events.
   The time series analysis of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration
   (PET) illustrated that over eastern part of India the increase in
   drought was attributed due to decrease in rainfall, whereas the decrease
   in drought occurrence over western arid region was mainly because of
   decrease in PET.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {There have been few studies conducted on the changes in actual ET over
   the Loess Plateau, due to the lack of reliable ET data. Based on ET data
   simulated by the Community Land Model, the present study analyzed the
   changes in ET over the Loess Plateau. The results showed the
   domain-average ET to have decreased in the past 31 years, at a rate of
   0.78 mm year(-1). ET fluctuated much more strongly in the 1990s than in
   the 1980s and 2000s, and, apart from in autumn, ET decreased in all
   seasons. In particular, ET in summer comprised about half of the annual
   ET trend and had the sharpest trend, dominating the interannual decline.
   ET also decreased more sharply in the semiarid than semihumid regions.
   The declining trend of ET was attributed to declining precipitation and
   air humidity. Locally, the ET trend was closely related to local mean
   annual precipitation: in areas with precipitation less than 400 mm, ET
   showed a decreasing trend; in areas with precipitation larger than 600
   mm, ET showed an increasing trend; and in areas with precipitation in
   the range of 400-600 mm could be classified as a transitional zone.},

Title = {COMPARISON OF INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY MODES AND TRENDS OF SEASONAL
   PRECIPITATION AND STREAMFLOW IN SOUTHERN QUEBEC (CANADA)},
Journal = {RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {28},
Number = {10},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The interactions between precipitation, streamflow and groundwater are
   very complex. In cold temperate regions characterized by harsh winters,
   winter streamflow is mainly derived from aquifers that are recharged in
   the spring, during snowmelt, and in the fall, when evapotranspiration is
   subdued. Despite this complexity, the modes and trends in the
   interannual variability of spring (April, May, June and July) streamflow
   and fall (August, September, October and November) precipitation and
   streamflow were compared to the modes and trends in the interannual
   variability of winter (December, January, February and March) streamflow
   in southern Quebec from 1950 to 2000. Results indicate that the
   variability modes are identical for all four of these hydro-climatic
   variables: two modes (south-east and east modes) on the south shore of
   the St. Lawrence River on either side of the 47 degrees N and a single
   mode (south-west mode) on the north shore. As for the trend, a
   significant increase in winter streamflow was observed on the north
   shore. This increase is comparable to that observed in spring
   streamflow, which suggests that winter streamflow on the north shore is
   mainly derived from groundwater recharge during the spring. Moreover,
   both spring and winter streamflows are positively correlated to the
   North Atlantic Oscillation climate index. On the south shore, south of
   the 47 degrees N, a significant decrease was observed in the trend of
   the interannual variability of winter streamflow, this in spite of a
   significant increase in fall precipitation and streamflow. An increase
   in evaporation (decreased infiltration) due to a shift from forest cover
   to agricultural land cover in this region could account for this.
   However, fall precipitation and streamflow and winter streamflow are
   significantly correlated to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation winter
   index. This correlation is negative with the first two variables but
   positive with the third. This study suggests that, in southern Quebec,
   the interannual variability of winter streamflow is mainly affected by
   spring recharge in non-agricultural catchments (east and south-west
   modes) and by farming in agricultural catchments (south-east mode).

Title = {Long-term trend of precipitation in China and its association with the

Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The plausible long-term trend of precipitation in China and its
   association with El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) are investigated by
   using non-parametric techniques. It is concluded that a greater number
   of decreasing trends are observed than are expected to occur by chance.
   Geographically, the decreasing trend was concentrated in most parts of
   China, including the Songliao River, Hai River, Huai River, Yellow
   River, Zhujiang River, and southern part of the Yangtze River basins,
   whereas an increasing trend appeared primarily in the western and middle
   parts of China, mainly including the Inland River basin, and the
   northern part of the Yangtze River basins. Monthly mean precipitation
   for the summer and early autumn months generally decreased, with the
   greatest decrease occurring in August. The precipitation in spring from
   January to April and later autumn, including September and October,
   tended to increase. The teleconnection between precipitation and ENSO
   has been investigated by using the non-parametric Kendall's tau. The
   correlation coefficients between the southern oscillation index (SOI)
   and precipitation show the areas with positive or negative associations.
   Approximately 20\% of the stations exhibit statistically significant
   correlations between SOI and precipitation, of which 70\% show a
   negative correlation, with most of them appearing in southeast China and
   several appearing in northwest and northeast China. Similar regional
   patterns are also observed when the precipitation records are further
   subdivided into El Nino, La Nina, and neutral periods. Statistical tests
   for the three kinds of time series were carried out using the
   non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and it is noted that the stations
   with significant differences in precipitation averages are mainly marked
   in the Yellow River basin and south China. The frequencies of below- and
   ahove-average precipitation that occurred during the El Nino, La Nina,
   and neutral periods are estimated as well. The result shows that greater
   precipitation may be associated with El Nino episodes in south China,
   but drought may easily occur during El Nino episodes in the Yellow River
   basin. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {A study on precipitation trend and fluctuation mechanism in northwestern
   China over the past 60 years},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the mechanism of the trend and oscillation in
   precipitation records in northwestern China over the past 60 years. The
   results from regression and orthogonal wavelet decomposition show a
   clearly ascending in annual precipitation since 2000, which is
   contributed mostly by significant increase in autumn and winter
   precipitations, while almost no trend can be identified in spring and
   summer time, which shows a weak descending in non-linear form. This may
   be in connection with different warming rates in seasons. There is a
   significant anti-correlation between the precipitation and the North
   Atlantic oscillation (NAO) on the inter-annual scale. About 80\% of
   their variances concentrate on inter-annual and multi-decadal scales.
   The multi-decadal components of NAO index have a phase leading about 10
   years to corresponding precipitation, about 4-5 years leg for AMO.
   Hence, NAO index can be used as an indicator for inter-decadal change of
   the precipitation. Other results from combination-difference analysis
   show that the NAO in extreme negative phase could lead to the
   precipitation increase in central Asia and northwestern China, owing to
   increase in eastward water-vapor transport from south Europe to
   Northwestern China, which causes an increase in column water vapor
   content in the above areas, and meanwhile the transient eddy activity
   becomes intensified in the areas or north with a further south route
   moving from Europe, Central Asia throughout northwestern China. On the
   contrary, a dry climate might appear in the areas when meet extreme
   positive phase of NAO. Thus, NAO's oscillation is one of the most
   important mechanisms for inter-annual change in precipitation of
   northwestern China.},

Abstract = {A new approach to define heavy and extreme rainfall events based on
   cluster analysis and area-average rainfall series is presented. The
   annual frequency of the heavy and extreme rainfall events is obtained
   for the southeastern and southern Brazil regions. In the 1960-2004
   period, 510 (98) and 466 (77) heavy (extreme) rainfall events are
   identified in the two regions. Monthly distributions of the events
   closely follow the monthly climatological rainfall in the two regions.
   In both regions, annual heavy and extreme rainfall event frequencies
   present increasing trends in the 45-yr period. However, only in southern
   Brazil is the trend statistically significant. Although longer time
   series are necessary to ensure the existence of long-term trends, the
   positive trends are somewhat alarming since they indicate that climate
   changes, in terms of rainfall regimes, are possibly under way in Brazil.},

Title = {Role of Interhemispheric Heat Transport and Global Atmospheric Cooling
   in Multidecadal Trends of Northern Hemisphere Precipitation},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Changes in the hydrological cycle in the northern hemisphere (NH) have a
   significant socioeconomic impact. Thus, quantifying past changes and
   projecting future changes in this cycle are important. We analyzed the
   positive and negative multidecadal trends in the NH mean precipitation
   since the 1950s that were accurately reproduced by a state-of-the-art
   Earth system model. Results showed that changes in the interhemispheric
   heat transport play a major role in the NH atmospheric heat budget,
   accounting for 59\% of the negative-to-positive trend change in NH
   precipitation through a north-south shift in the tropical precipitation
   zone, and were strongly linked to Hadley circulation anomaly. The
   remaining 41\% corresponded to changes in atmospheric cooling with small
   interhemispheric differences, which were primarily related to clear-sky
   longwave radiation. These findings quantitatively agreed with the
   results from a multimodel analysis.
   Plain Language Summary The northern hemisphere (NH) mean precipitation
   was observed to decrease from the 1950s to the early 1980s and then
   increase from the mid-1980s onward. We analyzed simulated results
   obtained using a state of the art Earth system model and investigated
   the factors contributing to these observed precipitation trends. Results
   shows that 59\% of the negative to positive changes in the NH mean
   precipitation trends were related to a north-south shift in the tropical
   precipitation zone and can be attributed to changes in the heat
   transport across the equator, which are strongly linked to the tropical
   circulation associated with flows across the equator. When the southward
   flow in the upper layer and northward flow in the lower layer increase,
   heat flows out of the NH, and moisture flows into the NH from the
   southern hemisphere, which increases the precipitation in the NH. The
   remaining 41\% of the change in NH precipitation trends were the global
   mean component of the precipitation changes, which could mostly be
   attributed to the effects of radiative cooling in the atmosphere. These
   findings quantitatively agreed with the results from a multimodel
   analysis, which indicates their robustness.},

Title = {Evaluation of Reanalyzed Precipitation Variability and Trends Using the

Abstract = {Atmospheric reanalyses have been used in many studies to investigate the
   variabilities and trends of precipitation because of their global
   coverage and long record; however, their results must be properly
   analyzed and their uncertainties must be understood. In this study,
   precipitation estimates from five global reanalyses {[}ERA-Interim;
   MERRA, version 2 (MERRA2); JRA-55; CFSR; and 20CR, version 2c (20CRv2c)]
   and one regional reanalysis (NARR) are compared against the CPC Unified
   Gauge-Based Analysis (CPCUGA) and GPCP over the contiguous United States
   (CONUS) during the period 1980-2013. Reanalyses capture the variability
   of the precipitation distribution over the CONUS as observed in CPCUGA
   and GPCP, but large regional and seasonal differences exist. Compared
   with CPCUGA, global reanalyses generally overestimate the precipitation
   over the western part of the country throughout the year and over the
   northeastern CONUS during the fall and winter seasons. These issues may
   be associated with the difficulties models have in accurately simulating
   precipitation over complex terrain and during snowfall events.
   Furthermore, systematic errors found in five global reanalyses suggest
   that their physical processes in modeling precipitation need to be
   improved. Even though negative biases exist in NARR, its spatial
   variability is similar to both CPCUGA and GPCP; this is anticipated
   because it assimilates observed precipitation, unlike the global
   reanalyses. Based on CPCUGA, there is an average decreasing trend of
   -1.38mm yr(-1) over the CONUS, which varies depending on the region with
   only the north-central to northeastern parts of the country having
   positive trends. Although all reanalyses exhibit similar interannual
   variation as observed in CPCUGA, their estimated precipitation trends,
   both linear and spatial trends, are distinct from CPCUGA.},

Abstract = {A trend analysis of 81 series of precipitation data from the last 30
   years (1960-1990) is presented. These series are from meteorological
   stations distributed throughout Costa Rica on the leeward and windward
   sides, both of which are affected by the trade-wind regime. Analysis of
   these data shows that over 75\% of Costa Rica has experienced a
   precipitation decrease during this period. Most of the areas affected by
   this trend are located along the leeward side of the mountain range
   which divides the country from northwest to southeast. However, on the
   windward side there has been a positive trend in precipitation,
   suggesting a strengthened trade-wind regime. An analysis of data on
   Atlantic hurricane trajectories since 1900 shows that the total number
   of hurricanes has increased, but there has been a reduction in the
   number crossing the Caribbean Basin. The passage of tropical cyclones in
   the Caribbean Basin accounts for around 70\% of total precipitation in
   the Pacific region of Central America. These countries economies are
   highly dependent on agriculture, and on water resources for energy
   generation; thus changes in hurricane patterns and associated rainfall
   could have important economic consequences.},

Abstract = {This study presented the spatio-temporal characteristics of extreme
   precipitation events in the Northern Highlands of Pakistan (NHPK). Daily
   precipitation observations of 30 in situ meteorological stations from
   1961 to 2014 were used to estimate the 11 extreme precipitation indices.
   Additionally, trends in time distribution patterns (TDPs) and return
   periods were also investigated for event based extreme precipitations
   (EEP). Results found that the precipitation events with an amount of
   160-320 mm and with a concentration ratio of 0.8-1.0 and a duration of
   4-7 consecutive days were dominant. The frequency of heavy, very heavy
   and extremely heavy precipitation days decreased, whereas the frequency
   of wet, very wet and extremely wet days increased. Most of the indices,
   generally, showed an increasing trend from the northeast to middle
   parts. The extreme precipitation events of the 20 and 50-year return
   period were more common in the western and central areas of NHPK.
   Moreover, the 20 and 50-year return levels depicted higher values (up to
   420 mm) for an event duration with all daily precipitation extremes
   dispersed in the first half (TDP1) in the Chitral, Panjkora and Jhelum
   Rivers basins, whilst the maximum values (up to 700 mm) for an event
   duration with all daily precipitation extremes dispersed in the second
   half (TDP2) were observed in the eastern part of the NHPK for 20-year
   and eastern and south-west for 50-year, respectively.},

   of 53 years (1961/1962 similar to 2013/2014) from 42 meteorological
   stations. The effective accumulative temperature index method was used
   to interpolate the winter wheat growth period data (recorded by 4
   representative agro-meteorological stations). The Mann-Kendall method
   was used to check the statistical significance of the trends. The
   following conclusions are based on these results. (1) The effective
   accumulative temperature index method can be used to interpolate the
   observed data. (2) The effective precipitation results show downward
   trends with magnitudes of 0 similar to- 6 mm/decade for the majority of
   the stations during certain stages (the tillering date to the jointing
   date, the jointing date to the heading date, and the entire growth
   period). (3) Most of the stations show strong downward trends during the
   growth stages corresponding to the tillering date to the jointing date
   and the jointing date to the heading date but show insignificant trends
   during other stages. (4) The spatially averaged effective precipitation
   data show very strong downward trends during the tillering to heading
   stage and weak downward trends over the entire growth period.},

Abstract = {Global monsoon precipitation (GMP) brings the majority of water for the
   local agriculture and ecosystem. The Northern Hemisphere (NH) GMP shows
   an upward trend over the past decades, while the trend in the Southern
   Hemisphere (SH) GMP is weak and insignificant. The first three singular
   value decomposition modes between NH GMP and global SST during boreal
   summer reflect, in order, the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO),
   eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino, and central Pacific (CP) El Nino, when the
   AMO dominates the NH climate and contributes to the increased trend.
   However, the first three modes between SH GMP and global SST during
   boreal winter are revealed as EP El Nino, the AMO, and CP El Nino, when
   the EP El Nino becomes the most significant driver of the SH GMP, and
   the AMO-induced rainfall anomalies may cancel out each other within the
   SH global monsoon domain and thus result in a weak trend. The
   intensification of NH GMP is proposed to favor the occurrences of
   droughts and heat waves (HWs) in the midlatitudes through a
   monsoon-desert-like mechanism. That is, the diabatic heating associated
   with the monsoonal rainfall may drive large-scale circulation anomalies
   and trigger intensified subsidence in remote regions. The anomalous
   descending motions over the midlatitudes are usually accompanied by
   clear skies, which result in less precipitation and more downward solar
   radiation, and thus drier and hotter soil conditions that favor the
   occurrences of droughts and HWs. In comparison, the SH GMP may exert
   much smaller impacts on the NH extremes in spring and summer, probably
   because the winter signals associated with SH GMP cannot sufficiently
   persist into the following seasons.},

   Atlantic origin in areas of the interior of the Iberian Peninsula. In
   order to do that we have worked in two sectors, the North and the South
   of the Central System. We worked with the same methodology of
   desaggregation. The results not only confirm the hypothesis of
   precipitation decrease but show generalized trends in decreasing totals

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite numerous assessments of satellite-based and reanalysis
   precipitation across the globe, few studies have been conducted based on
   the precipitation linear trend (LT), particularly during daytime and
   nighttime, when there are different precipitation mechanisms. Herein, we
   first examine LTs for the whole day (LTwd), daytime (LTd), and nighttime
   (LTn) over mainland China (MC) in 2003-2017, with sub-daily observations
   from a dense rain gauge network. For MC and ten Water Resources Regions
   (WRRs), annual and seasonal LTwd, LTd, and LT(n)were generally positive
   but with evident regional differences. Subsequently, annual and seasonal
   LTs derived from six satellite-based and six reanalysis popular
   precipitation products were evaluated using metrics of correlation
   coefficient (CC), bias, root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and sign
   accuracy. Finally, metric-based optimal products (OPs) were identified
   for MC and each WRR. Values of each metric for annual and seasonal LTwd,
   LTd, or LT(n)differ among products; meanwhile, for any single product,
   performance varied by season and time of day. Correspondingly, the
   metric-based OPs varied among regions and seasons, and between daytime
   and nighttime, but were mainly characterized by OPs of Tropical Rainfall
   Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42, ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA)-Interim, and
   Modern Era Reanalysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)-2. In
   particular, the CC-based (RMSE-based) OPs in southern and northern WRRs
   were generally TRMM3B42 and MERRA-2, respectively. These findings imply
   that to investigate precipitation change and obtain robust related
   conclusions using precipitation products, comprehensive evaluations are
   necessary, due to variation in performance within one year, one day and
   among regions for different products. Additionally, our study
   facilitates a valuable reference for product users seeking reliable
   precipitation estimates to examine precipitation change across MC, and
   an insight (i.e., capacity in detecting LTs, including daytime and
   nighttime) for developers improving algorithms.},

Abstract = {The trends of precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula (IF) and the
   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index from December to March are
   compared using observations and model simulations from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3). The evaluation is performed in
   two multi-models as derived by averaging simulations corresponding to
   two experiments: one represents climate in the 20th century (20C3M) and
   the other the scenario with medium forcing IPCC SRES AIB in the 21st
   century. The NAO index shows a trend to more positive phases and
   precipitation tends to decrease in the case of observations, with
   greater significance in the NAO than in precipitation. The simulations
   in the 20th century underestimate the trend both in the NAO and in
   precipitation compared to observations. The multi-model in the 21st
   century indicates a change in the NAO regimes to being more positive:
   this leads to a reduction of precipitation over the IF. To explain the
   precipitation trend changes we consider the response of precipitation to
   the NAO. the regression between sea level pressure (SLP) over the
   Euro-Atlantic area onto precipitation averaged over the IF and the
   composite of precipitation for years with greater and lower NAO.

Title = {Drivers of Twenty-First-Century US Winter Precipitation Trends in CMIP6
   Models: A Storyline-Based Approach},

Abstract = {Climate change during the twenty-first century has the potential to
   substantially alter geographic patterns of precipitation. However,
   regional precipitation changes can be very difficult to project, and in
   some regions, global climate models do not even agree on the sign of the
   precipitation trend. Since some of this uncertainty is due to internal
   variability rather than model bias, models cannot be used to narrow the
   possibilities to a single outcome, but they can usefully quantify the
   range of plausible outcomes and identify the combination of dynamical
   drivers that would be likely to produce each. This study uses a
   storylines approach-a type of regression-based analysis-to identify some
   of the key dynamical drivers that explain the variance in
   twenty-first-century U.S. winter precipitation trends across CMIP6
   models under the SSP3-7.0 emissions scenario. This analysis shows that
   the spread in precipitation trends is not primarily driven by
   differences in modeled climate sensitivity. Key drivers include
   global-mean surface temperature, but also tropical upper-troposphere
   temperature, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific-North
   America (PNA) pattern, and the east Pacific (EP) dipole (a dipole
   pattern in geopotential heights over North America's Pacific coast).
   Combinations of these drivers can reinforce or cancel to produce various
   high- or low-impact scenarios for winter precipitation trends in various
   regions of the United States. For example, the most extreme winter
   precipitation trends in the southwestern United States result from
   opposite trends in ENSO and EP, whereas the wettest winter precipitation
   trends in the midwestern United States result from a combination of
   strong global warming and a negative PNA trend.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The newest generation of climate models (CMIP6)
   is now available, but despite some improvements, models still disagree
   on future precipitation changes over North America. In some ways, this
   is to be expected: precipitation changes (both in the real world and in
   the models) depend partly on climate change, but also partly on random
   natural variability, so they will never be completely predictable. Thus,
   instead of trying to pin down future precipitation changes to a specific
   outcome, we show a range of plausible outcomes that policymakers should
   be prepared for. We also explore the reasons for the differences between
   model runs. For example, precipitation trends on the U.S. West Coast
   differ between models partly because precipitation in that region is
   affected by El Nino events (as well as other factors that we identify),
   and future changes to El Nino differ between models, even for the same
   amount of warming.},

Abstract = {The periodicity and the trend which are the important properties of
   water resources become more and more variable and complex because of the
   influence of topography, vegetation and the human activities. Wavelet
   Analysis which has Multi-resolution Analysis function can provide more
   detail information of the nonlinear and complex system. The periodicity
   and the trend of precipitation in different plain regions of Handan are
   illuminated with Morlet Wavelet Transform in Multi-time scales in this
   study. It is illustrated that the same periods (5years and 9years) exist
   in the precipitation in different plain regions of Handan and there are
   the similar variety and the similar trend in the scale of 5years or
   9years in different areas. This study would provide technical support
   for the integrated management and utilization of water resources of the

Abstract = {In this study, temporal trend analysis was conducted on the annual and
   quarterly meteorological variables of Lanzhou from 1951 to 2016, and a
   weighted Markov model for extremely high temperature prediction was
   constructed. Several non-parametric methods were used to analyse the
   trend of meteorological variables. Considering that sequence
   autocorrelation may affect the accuracy of the trend test, we performed
   an autocorrelation test and carried out trend analysis for sequences
   with autocorrelation after removing correlation. The results show that
   the maximum temperature, minimum temperature and average temperature in
   Lanzhou all have a significant upward trend and show different
   performances in each season. In detail, the trend of maximum temperature
   in the summer is not significant, while the upward trend of minimum
   temperature in the winter is the most significant, which leads to more
   and more ``warm winter{''} phenomenon. Finally, we construct a weighted
   Markov prediction model for extremely high temperature and obtain the
   conclusion that the prediction results by the model are consistent with
   the actual situation.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal trends in precipitation and their implications for water
   resources management in climate-sensitive Nepal},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {43},
Pages = {138-146},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As one of the world's most water-abundant countries Nepal has plenty of
   water, yet resources are unevenly distributed, both spatially and
   temporally. Limited accessibility and poorly managed water resources
   continue to inhibit socioeconomic development. Poverty levels are high
   across the nation (57\% of the population lives below the international
   poverty line) and population expansion, coupled with rapid environmental
   change, is thought to be placing substantial pressure on water
   resources; an irrefutable asset for sustaining livelihoods and an
   essential contributing factor for alleviating poverty. Precipitation is
   a vital water resource for much of the rural population, 80\% of which
   are dependent on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods, and
   fluctuations in which can give rise to changing states of poverty. Here
   we provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of precipitation
   time-series data for Nepal and discuss the contribution of precipitation
   change to water resources management for this land-locked Himalayan
   nation. We show that precipitation totals have predominantly remained
   stable; precipitation extremes and variability indicate widespread
   decrease; and no clear variation in monsoon onset date is reported.
   Based on these results, we suggest that water resources management needs
   to focus on population and environmental pressures, rather than
   specifically mitigating for precipitation change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {36},
Number = {18},

Abstract = {Historical precipitation and temperature trends and variations over
   global land regions are compared with sim-ulations of two climate models
   focusing on grid points with substantial observational coverage from the
   early twentieth cen-tury. Potential mechanisms for the differences
   between modeled and observed trends are investigated using subsets of
   historical forcings, including ones using only anthropogenic greenhouse
   gases or aerosols, and simulations forced with the ob-served sea surface
   temperature and sea ice distribution. For century-scale (1915-2014)
   precipitation trends, underestimated in-creasing or unrealistic
   decreasing trends are found in the models over the extratropical
   Northern Hemisphere. The temporal evolution of key discrepancies between
   the observations and simulations indicates that 1) for averages over 15
   \& DEG;-45 \& DEG;N, while there is not a significant trend in
   observations, both models simulate reduced precipitation from 1940 to
   2014, and 2) for 45 \& DEG;-80 \& DEG;N observations suggest sizable
   precipitation increases while models do not show a significant increase,
   particularly during ;1950-80. The timing of differences between models
   and observations suggests a key role for aerosols in these dry trend
   biases over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, 3) for
   15 \& DEG;S-15 \& DEG;N the observed multidecadal decrease over tropical
   west Africa (1950-80) is only roughly captured by simulations forced
   with observed sea surface temperature; additionally, 4) in the
   all-forcing runs, the model with higher global climate sensitivity
   simulates increasing trends of temperature and precipitation over lands
   north of 45 \& DEG;N that are significantly stronger than the
   lower-sensitivity model and more consistent with the observed increases.
   Thus, underestimated greenhouse gas-induced warming\}particularly in the
   lower sensitivity model\}may be another important factor, besides
   aerosols, contributing to the modeled biases in precipitation trends.},

Abstract = {This paper intended to investigate spatio-temporal monotonic trend and
   shift in concentration of monsoon precipitation across West Bengal,
   India, by analysing, the time series of monthly precipitation from 18
   weather stations during the period from 1901 to 2002. In dealing with,
   the inhomogeneity in the precipitation series, RHtestsV4 software
   package is used to detect, and adjust for, multiple change points
   (shifts) that could exist in data series. Finally, the cumulative
   deviation test was applied at 5\% significant level to check the
   homogeneity (presence of historic changes by cumulative deviations
   test). Afterward, non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Theil-Sen
   estimator (TSE) was applied to detect of nature and slope of trends;
   and, Sequential Mann Kendall (SQMK) test was applied for detection of
   turning point and magnitude of change in trends. Prior to the
   application of statistical tests, the pre-whitening technique was used
   to eliminate the effect of autocorrelation in precipitation data series.
   Four indices- precipitation concentration index (PCI), precipitation
   concentration degree (PCD), precipitation concentration period (PCP) and
   fulcrum (centre of gravity) were used to detect precipitation
   concentration and the spatial pattern in it. The application of the
   above-mentioned procedures has shown very notable statewide monotonic
   trend for monsoon precipitation time series. Regional cluster analysis
   by SQMK found increasing precipitation in mountain and coastal regions
   in general, except during the non-monsoon seasons. The results show that
   higher PCI values were mainly observed in South Bengal, whereas lower
   PCI values were mostly detected in North Bengal. The PCI values are
   noticeably larger in places where both monsoon total precipitation and
   span of rainy season are lower. The results of PCP reveal that
   precipitation in Gangetic Bengal mostly occurs in summer (monsoon
   season), and the rainy season arrives earlier in North Bengal than South
   Bengal, whereas the results of PCD also indicate that the precipitation
   in North Bengal was more dispersed within a year than that in South
   Bengal. The concentration characteristic of precipitation could be
   detected by fulcrum analysis, and significant concentration over most of
   West Bengal was obvious within July month band. Precipitation trend
   observed in West Bengal is compared with that in Central India (CI)
   region and comparison of precipitation departure with Indian monsoon and
   Gangetic Bengal can be explained by forecasting ensemble. (C) 2016

Abstract = {This study investigates future changes in precipitation over the CRB
   (Columbia River Basin) in both wet (DJF) and dry (JJA) seasons under
   RCP85 GHG emission scenario. The simulations from four climate models
   which participated in CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   Phase-5) were downscaled using the BCSD (Bias Correction and Spatial
   Disaggregation) method. After downscaling, extreme value analysis and
   MME (Multi Model Ensemble) averaging is performed. This study focuses on
   computing 2, 5, 10 and 25 years return levels for both winter (DJF) and
   summer (JJA) seasons. The maximum winter precipitation values for 2, 5,
   10 and 25 years return periods have been estimated to be about 112, 127,
   148 and 171 mm/day respectively whereas the maximum summer precipitation
   values for 2, 5, 10 and 25 years return periods are observed to be about
   56, 81, 96 and 126 mm/day respectively. The MME average outperformed the
   individual models in simulating the historical precipitation in both
   seasons. The MME results showed a consistent and significant increase in
   the extreme precipitation and decrease in mean precipitation in both
   future wet and dry seasons. Largest increase in precipitation occurs
   over the higher elevations of the Cascades Range, Coast Range and the
   Mountainous Range.},

   Walker Circulation Trend in CMIP5 AMIP Models},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Observational evidence shows that the Walker circulation (WC) in the
   tropical Pacific has strengthened in recent decades. In this study, we
   examine the WC trend for 1979-2005 and its relationship with the
   precipitation associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   using the sea surface temperature (SST)-constrained Atmospheric Model
   Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models. All of the 29
   models show a strengthening of the WC trend in response to an increase
   in the SST zonal gradient along the equator. Despite the same
   SST-constrained AMIP simulations, however, a large diversity is found
   among the CMIP5 climate models in the magnitude of the WC trend. The
   relationship between the WC trend and precipitation anomalies (PRCPAs)
   associated with ENSO (ENSO-related PRCPAs) shows that the longitudinal
   position of the ENSO-related PRCPAs in the western tropical Pacific is
   closely related to the magnitude of the WC trend. Specifically, it is
   found that the strengthening of the WC trend is large (small) in the
   CMIP5 AMIP simulations in which the ENSO-related PRCPAs are located
   relatively westward (eastward) in the western tropical Pacific.
   Therefore, the zonal shift of the ENSO-related precipitation in the
   western tropical Pacific, which is associated with the climatological
   mean precipitation in the tropical Pacific, could play an important role
   in modifying the WC trend in the CMIP5 climate models.},

Title = {To know what we cannot know: Global mapping of minimal detectable
   absolute trends in annual precipitation},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {47},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Fresh water resources, human societies, and ecosystems are expected to
   be strongly impacted by climate change, with precipitation trends being
   one of the most important elements that will be closely monitored.
   However, the natural variability of precipitation data can often mask
   existing trends such that the results appear as statistically
   insignificant. Information on the limitations of trend detection is
   important for risk assessment and for decision making related to
   adaption strategies under inherent uncertainties. This paper reports on
   an effort to quantify and map minimal detectable absolute trends in
   annual precipitation data series on a global scale. Monte Carlo
   simulations were conducted to generate realizations of trended
   precipitation data for different precipitation means and coefficients of
   variance, and the Mann-Kendall method was applied for detecting the
   trend significance. Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)
   VASClimO data was used to compute the mean and coefficient of variance
   of annual precipitation over land and to map minimal detectable absolute
   trends. It was found that relatively high magnitude trends (positive or
   negative) have a low chance of being detected as a result of high
   natural variance of the precipitation data. The largest undetectable
   trends were found for the tropics. Arid and semiarid regions also
   present high relative values in terms of percent change from the mean
   annual precipitation. Although the present analysis is based on several
   simplified assumptions, the goal was to point out an inherent problem of
   potentially undetectable high absolute trends that must be considered in
   analyzing precipitation data series and assessing risks in adaption
   strategies to climate change.},

Abstract = {Precipitation monitoring was conducted at the six sites in western Japan
   during the period 1987-1996. The results indicated that the annual mean
   concentration of NO3- in precipitation generally increased at all sites
   during that period. As a result, the NO3-/nssSO(4)(2-) ratio in
   precipitation significantly increased by 27-51\% over the past 9 years.
   Since the 1980s, NOx and SO2 emissions in East Asia have rapidly
   increased. The increase rate for NOx emissions in the region was larger
   than that for SO2 emissions. Therefore, the results suggested that the
   contribution of HNO3 to the acidity of precipitation in a large area in
   western Japan increased due to the changes in the emissions in East
   Asia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The frequency and intensity of meteorological droughts over the
   Indo-Gangetic Region (IGR) of India pertaining to the rice crop during
   kharif season (June to July to October to November) and the wheat crop
   during the rabi season (November to December to March) were assessed
   using the standardized precipitation index (SPI). The monthly
   distribution of rainfall is more crucial than the cumulative seasonal
   rainfall on rice-wheat (RW) productivity. Consequently, an attempt was
   made to measure the effectiveness of using monthly SPI from June to
   September to assess drought on RW productivity over five major RW
   growing states of IGR in India. An attempt is also made to test the use
   of monthly SPI for the early kharif rice and rabi wheat forecasts for
   these states. The long-term (1906-2005) mean annual rainfall of IGR is
   1099.1 mm with a standard deviation of 115.7 mm and a coefficient of
   variation of 10.5\%. It was observed that the kharif rice productivity
   index and monthly SPI from June to September have a significant (R-2 =
   0.44) multiple regression at 0.001 level over IGR. It was also observed
   that in the Indo-Gangetic Region, the wheat productivity index and
   monthly SPI (June to September) have an insignificant (R-2 = 0.21)
   multiple regression. It indicated that the monthly distribution of
   monsoon rainfall in terms of the SPI accounted for 44\% yield
   variability in rice and 21\% yield variability in wheat. Thus, these
   indices may be used for forecasting the productivity of the RW system
   over IGR states in India. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological

Abstract = {The phenomenon of drought is common in the world, especially in
   Pakistan. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the spatial and
   temporal variability of drought and rainfall in Pakistan. Therefore, the
   objectives of this study are to identify homogeneous rainfall regions
   and their trend regions, as well as the impact of ENSO phases. In this
   study, monthly rainfall data from 44 weather stations are used during
   1980-2019. Moreover, descriptive and exploratory statistics tests (e.g.,
   Pettitt and Mann-Kendall-MK), Sen method, and cluster analysis (CA) are
   evaluated along with the annual Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
   on spatiotemporal scales. ENSO occurrences were classified based on the
   Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) for region 3.4. Using the cophenetic
   correlation coefficient (CCC) and a significance level of 5\%, seven
   methods were applied to the rainfall series, with the complete method
   (CCC > 0.9082) being the best. According to the CA method, Pakistan has
   four groups of homogeneous rainfall (G(1), G(2), G(3), and G(4)).
   Descriptive and exploratory statistics showed that G(1) differs from the
   other groups in size and spatial distribution. Pettitt's technique
   identified the most extreme El Nino years in terms of spatial and
   temporal drought variability, along with the wettest months (March,
   August, September, June, and December) in Pakistan. Non-significant
   increases in Pakistan's annual precipitation were identified via the MK
   test, with exceptions in the southern and northern regions,
   respectively. No significant increase in rainfall in Pakistan was found
   using the Sen method, especially in regions G(2), G(3), and G(4). The
   severity of the drought in Pakistan is intensified by El Nino events,
   which demand attention from public managers in the management of water
   resources, agriculture, and the country's economy.},

Title = {Satellite-based precipitation estimates using a dense rain gauge network
   over the Southwestern Brazilian Amazon: Implication for identifying
   trends in dry season rainfall},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {261},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Accurate long-term estimates of rainfall at fine spatial and temporal
   resolution are vital for hydrometeorology and climatology studies, but
   such data are often unavailable in remote regions. We assessed the
   accuracy of three satellite-based precipitation products that have data
   from 1981 to 2019 over the state of Rondo<SIC>nia in the Brazilian
   Amazon: (a) satellite-only, using the Climate Hazards Group Infrared
   Precipitation (CHIRP) product, (b) CHIRP with sparse gauge data
   (CHIRPS), and (c) CHIRPS calibrated with data from a dense rain gauge
   network (N = 73) (dnCHIRPS). We evaluated the rainfall products using
   additional validation gauges (N = 55) at the monthly and seasonal time
   scales and compared their drought events and temporal trends. Both CHIRP
   (10.0 mm/month mean error (ME), 23.6\% percent bias (PB)) and CHIRPS
   (-0.08ME, 7.4\% PB) underestimate high monthly rainfall in the wet
   season and overestimate low monthly rainfall during the dry season.
   dnCHIRPS had a lower error in monthly rainfall (-0.01ME, 1.1\%PB)
   compared with CHIRP and CHIRPS, with the largest percentage difference
   between dnCHIRPS and the other two datasets in the dry season. dnCHIRPS
   captured decreasing trends in dry season rainfall over agricultural
   parts of the state, trends that were missed by the other two products.
   We conclude that a high density of rain gauges is essential for
   documenting the spatial pattern and trends in rainfall during the dry
   season and droughts in this important agricultural region of the Amazon
   basin.},

Title = {Long-Term Free-Atmosphere Temperature Trends in China Derived from
   Homogenized In Situ Radiosonde Temperature Series},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1037-1051},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In this paper, radiosonde temperature time series (RTT) from 1958 to
   2005 collected by the 116-station Chinese radiosonde network are
   examined. Quality control and homogenization are used to obtain a
   reliable RTT. The homogenization results revealed significant
   discontinuities in the RTT. Analysis suggested that 70\% data
   availability is the minimum data requirement (MDR) for these RTTs. A new
   dataset is built by meeting this MDR, which reduced the number of
   potential stations from 116 to 92. Analysis on this dataset reveals that
   warming trends in the troposphere and cooling trends in the stratosphere
   were weakened by reducing the stations. Averaged RTT trends for China
   were generally consistent with those of global scale, but with some
   discrepancies. During 1958-2005, averaged temperatures in China tended
   to decrease in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, in contrast
   to warming trends in the mid-and lower troposphere. The trends varied
   with two different subperiods. For 1958-78, cooling trends in the entire
   atmosphere were similar to trends at the global scale. For 1979-2005,
   warming occurred in the lower troposphere, with the amplitude of the
   warming tending to weaken with increases in altitude and shifting to a
   cooling trend above 400 hPa. Seasonal trend structures suggest that
   warming in the lower troposphere is attributable to temperature
   increases in December-February (DJF); cooling in the upper troposphere
   and stratosphere was found mainly in June-August (JJA). Unlike with
   results of a larger spatial scale, a robust cooling layer was found
   around 300 hPa.},

Title = {Impact of cascade reservoirs on continuity of river water temperature: A
   temperature trend hypothesis in river},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Water temperature is an important habitat factor in river ecosystems
   that exhibits the characteristics of continuous change. Dam construction
   disrupts the continuity of river water temperature and reset it, thus
   exerting sharp rise/decrease on the characteristics of water temperature
   change. The effect of a dam on river continuity is directly related to
   the dam size. To explain this relationship, two rivers in China were
   selected: one river without reservoirs and one river with cascade
   reservoirs. Through the analysis of the longitudinal change of water
   temperature in free-flowing rivers, we found that water temperature
   changes continuously and steadily in the longitudinal direction. Based
   on this, a temperature trend hypothesis in river was proposed, and the
   discontinuity of the water temperature in the reservoir section was
   evaluated. The results are as follows: (1) In mixed reservoirs, river
   water temperature remained as continuous as free-flowing rivers.
   However, the river water temperature had a large discontinuity in the
   stratified reservoir. (2) Water residence time was used as an indicator
   of the continuity of reservoir water temperature. (3) Selective
   withdrawal of stratified reservoirs in January could not remove the
   discontinuity caused by itself, but it worked in June.},

Abstract = {Temperature is a key variable for monitoring global climate change. Here
   we perform a trend analysis of Swiss temperatures from 1959 to 2008,
   using a new 2 x 2 km gridded data-set based on carefully homogenised
   ground observations from MeteoSwiss. The aim of this study is twofold:
   first, to discuss the spatial and altitudinal temperature trend
   characteristics in detail, and second, to quantify the contribution of
   changes in atmospheric circulation and local effects to these trends.
   The seasonal trends are all positive and mostly significant with an
   annual average warming rate of 0.35 C/decade (similar to 1.6 times the
   northern hemispheric warming rate), ranging from 0.17 in autumn to 0.48
   degrees C/decade in summer. Altitudedependent trends are found in autumn
   and early winter where the trends are stronger at low altitudes (< 800 m
   asl), and in spring where slightly stronger trends are found at
   altitudes close to the snow line.
   Part of the trends can be explained by changes in atmospheric
   circulation, but with substantial differences from season to season. In
   winter, circulation effects account for more than half the trends, while
   this contribution is much smaller in other seasons. After removing the
   effect of circulation, the trends still show seasonal variations with
   higher values in spring and summer. The circulation-corrected trends are
   closer to the values simulated by a set of ENSEMBLES regional climate
   models, with the models still tending towards a trend underestimation in
   spring and summer.
   Our results suggest that both circulation changes and more local effects
   are important to explain part of recent warming in spring, summer, and
   autumn. Snow- albedo feedback effects could be responsible for the
   stronger spring trends at altitudes close to the snow line, but the
   overall effect is small. In autumn, the observed decrease in fog
   frequency might be a key process in explaining the stronger temperature
   trends at low altitudes. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Body temperature is one of the fundamental measures considered in the
   assessment of health and well-being, with various medical conditions
   known to give rise to abnormal changes in temperature. In particular,
   abnormal variations in dynamic temperature patterns during walking or
   exercise may be linked to a range of foot problems, which are of
   particular concern in diabetic patients.
   A number of studies have investigated normative temperature patterns of
   a population by considering data from multiple participants and
   averaging results after an acclimatisation interval. In this work we
   demonstrate that the temperature patterns obtained using such an
   approach may not be truly representative of temperature changes in a
   population, and the averaging process adopted may yield skewed results.
   An alternative approach to determine generic reference temperature
   patterns based on a minimization of root mean square differences between
   time-shifted versions of temperature data collected from multiple
   participants is proposed. The results obtained indicate that this
   approach can yield a general trend that is more representative of actual
   temperature changes across a population than conventional averaging
   methods. The method we propose is also shown to better capture and link
   the effects of factors that influence dynamic temperature trends, which
   could in turn lead to a better understanding of underlying physiological
   phenomena.},

Pages = {15-27},
Abstract = {Long-term trends in annual, seasonal, and monthly mean temperature
   (abbreviated as AMT, SMT, MMT, respectively) in Japan are investigated.
   The magnitude of a trend is measured by assuming it to be linear. The
   statistical significance of a site trend is assessed by the Mann-Kendall
   (MK) with consideration of serial correlation. The statistical field
   significance of trends in three major climatic regions: Hokkaido (I),
   areas adjacent to the Japan sea (II), and to the Pacific Ocean (III), is
   evaluated by the bootstrapping test which preserves cross-correlation
   among sites.
   From 1900 to 1996, AMT increased from 0.51 to 2.77 degreesC averaged
   across all 46 sites. At the regional scale, AMT increased by 1.38, 1.08,
   and 1.32 degreesC in regions I, II, and III, respectively. The trends at
   both sites and regions are statistically significant even at the
   significance level (alpha) of 0.005. SMT increased from 0.47 to 3.69
   degreesC at all the 19 available sites with the highest increases in
   winter and spring. Except for a few series, the changes in SMT are
   statistically significant at alpha = 0.01. The upward trends in SMT are
   statistically significant even at alpha = 0.001 in both regions II and
   III. MMT at 19 sites increased within a wide range from 0.17 to 4.12
   degreesC. The increases are largest in the winter and spring months, and
   most of the site increases are statistically significant at alpha =
   0.05. The trends are statistically significant at alpha = 0.025 and
   0.001 in regions II and III, respectively. The trends in both SMT and
   MMT in region III are larger than those in region II.},

Abstract = {The largest atmospheric temperature changes due to the increase of
   greenhouse gases are expected in the 40 to 60 km altitude region, where
   enhanced infrared cooling decreases the temperature.  Ten-year
   (1980-1990) temperature trends at 55 km and 0.4 mb, derived using data
   from the ground-based lidar at Haute Provence, 44-degrees-N 6-degrees-E,
   and the SSU channel 47X on several satellites, are presented.  These
   data show temperature decreases that are as large and in some cases
   exceed predictions based on current models.  At 44-degrees-N, the
   ground-based lidar and satellite techniques give a negative trend of
   -0.10 +/- 0.04\% per year and -0.14 +/- 0.02\% per year, respectively. 
   Agreement between these two data sets based on different measurement
   techniques gives confidence in the detected trends at this latitude. 
   Further analysis of the SSU 47X satellite data between 45-degrees-S and
   45-degrees-N indicates a maximum decline of 0.16\% per year near
   30-degrees-N.  A minimum trend decrease of 0.07\% per year is detected
   between 20-degrees and 30-degrees-S.  Based on NOAA satellite radiance
   observations, these long-term temperature changes are larger than
   changes at any of the other stratospheric levels below 55 km monitored
   during this period.},

Volume = {35},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We have developed a new monthly temperature database for mainland Spain
   by using the complete holding of maximum and minimum monthly mean values
   stored at the Spanish National Meteorological Agency (AEMet). After an
   exhaustive quality control exercise, the data set includes 1358 complete
   series, and a high-resolution grid (0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees) was
   calculated to analyse monthly trends. There has been an uneven increase
   in the mean values of maximum and minimum temperatures in the Spanish
   mainland from 1951 to 2010. The maximum monthly mean temperature values
   have risen mostly in late winter/early spring and the summer, while the
   minimum monthly mean temperature values have increased in summer, spring
   and autumn in southern areas. The spatial pattern of the diurnal
   temperature range shows a clear north-south gradient in summer, with
   positive trends in the north and negative trends in the south;
   furthermore, a negative pattern has been detected in the south in spring
   and autumn. These areas, particularly the Mediterranean coastland, have
   been subject to dramatic urbanization and land use changes during the
   past 30 years that may have affected nocturnal temperatures, in
   particular. Thus, warming processes in the Iberian Peninsula appear to
   be influenced both by global factors and more local ones, and their
   effects should be differentiated spatially.},

Title = {Long-term temperature trends and variability on Spitsbergen: the
   extended Svalbard Airport temperature series, 1898-2012},
Journal = {POLAR RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {One of the few long instrumental records available for the Arctic is the
   Svalbard Airport composite series that hitherto began in 1911, with
   observations made on Spitsbergen, the largest island in the Svalbard
   Archipelago. This record has now been extended to 1898 with the
   inclusion of observations made by hunting and scientific expeditions.
   Temperature has been observed almost continuously in Svalbard since
   1898, although at different sites. It has therefore been possible to
   create one composite series for Svalbard Airport covering the period
   1898-2012, and this valuable new record is presented here. The series
   reveals large temperature variability on Spitsbergen, with the early
   20th century warming as one striking feature: an abrupt change from the
   cold 1910s to the local maxima of the 1930s and 1950s. With the
   inclusion of the new data it is possible to show that the 1910s were
   colder than the years at the start of the series. From the 1960s,
   temperatures have increased, so the present temperature level is
   significantly higher than at any earlier period in the instrumental
   history. For the entire period, and for all seasons, there are positive,
   statistically significant trends. Regarding the annual mean, the total
   trend is 2.6 degrees C/century, whereas the largest trend is in spring,
   at 3.9 degrees C/century. In Europe, it is the Svalbard Archipelago that
   has experienced the greatest temperature increase during the latest
   three decades. The composite series may be downloaded from the home page
   of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and should be used with
   reference to the present article.},

Abstract = {Observations show that global average tropospheric temperatures have
   been rising during the past century, with the most recent portion of
   record showing a sharp rise since the mid-1970s. This study shows that
   the most recent portion of the global temperature record (1970 to 1992)
   can be closely reproduced by atmospheric models forced only with
   observed ocean surface temperatures. In agreement with a diverse suite
   of controversial observational evidence from the past 40 years, the
   upward trend in simulated tropospheric temperatures is caused by an
   enhancement of the tropical hydrologic cycle driven by increasing
   tropical ocean temperatures. Although it is possible that the observed
   behavior is due to natural climate variability, there is disquieting
   similarity between these model results, observed climate trends in
   recent decades, and the early expressions of the climatic response to
   increased atmospheric carbon dioxide in numerical simulations.},

Abstract = {Trend detection is model-dependent. We analyze this for auto-correlated
   temperature time series. By the comparison of two different models which
   both describe the same stochastic process, we can introduce the
   distinction between the observed trend and the intrinsic trend. We
   transform a model with correlated noise into the lagged dependent
   variable (LDV) model with white noise. Although the commonly used
   climate dynamical model usually contains the LDV, existing trend studies
   barely consider it. For the LDV model, the auto-correlation effect on
   trend detection not only induces the stochastic trend, but also leads to
   an additional trend by accumulating the intrinsic trend. The intrinsic
   trend exclusive of the auto-correlation effect should be more likely
   related to the external forcing like anthropogenic factors, which is
   actually the trend of main interest. By applying the LDV model to the
   monthly mean anomalies at the Potsdam, Hamburg, and Frankfurt stations,
   it is found that 87\%, 78\%, and 75\%, respectively, of the observed
   trends are the intrinsic trend, which may be more relevant to
   anthropogenic factors; and the rest should be due to auto-correlation.
   Analysis of two additional Chinese stations, namely the Guangzhou and
   Turpan stations, demonstrates the general applicability of the LDV model
   for different climate zones. Our study refreshes the current
   understanding of the observed trend and the auto-correlation effect,
   which is expected to be beneficial in the exploration of the underlying
   mechanism of global warming.},

Abstract = {This note updates the temperature trend study of the contiguous 48
   United States by Lund et al. for data observed during the 4-yr period
   1997-2000. A parsimonious changepoint parameterization is now used, and
   the methods for handling missing data are improved. The number of
   stations with useable data has now increased from 359 to 969, thereby
   improving the accuracy of the reported spatial patterns in the trends.
   The average record length of the 969 stations is now 103 yr, with the
   longest record starting in 1812 and the shortest in 1926. The
   methodological improvements and additional 4 yr of data produce slightly
   smaller trend estimate standard errors. Warming is found in the
   Northeast, West, and northern Midwest, with slight cooling in the
   Southeast; overall, the trends here suggest more warming than those of
   the Lund et al. study.},

Abstract = {Linear temperature trends and their uncertainties from data at 359
   recording stations in the contiguous United States are investigated. A
   statistical model is developed that accounts for changes in the site
   location of each station, the seasonal means and variances inherent in
   monthly temperature series, and the temporal and spatial correlations
   found in such data. Least squares estimates of the seasonal trend
   parameters in the model are derived, as well as appropriate standard
   errors that take into account the site changes, periodicities and
   temporal correlations present in the data. The estimates and their
   standard errors at each station are then spatially analyzed to identify
   geographical patterns of temperature change across the United States.

Title = {Contrasting sensitivity of air temperature trends to surface soil
   temperature trends between climate models and reanalyses},
Journal = {NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {The sensitivity strength of air temperature (T) to surface soil
   temperature (sST) (namely beta hereafter) constitutes a significant
   factor in how global climate models quantify changes in the climate.
   This study examines how this sensitivity is represented in the CMIP6
   models. Results show regional differences and even contrasts in the beta
   trends at interannual scales between climate models and two reanalysis
   products during 1980-2014. At high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere
   (NH), beta is stronger in the CMIP6 models than in the reanalysis data.
   Additionally, the beta trends differ between the CMIP6 and reanalysis
   data, which may be related to the different precipitation (PR) and soil
   water availability (PR-ET) trends between the models. In the regions of
   increasing beta intensity at high latitudes in the NH, sST is more
   sensitive to PR and PR-ET. Consequently, increasing PR and PR-ET leads
   to slower sST changes, potentially making beta intensity stronger in
   CMIP6 models. However, in the reanalysis data, decreases in PR and PR-ET
   accelerate sST changes, leading to a weakening of the beta intensity. A
   resulting implication is that beta, based on high-emission scenarios,
   shows a stronger trend during 2015-2100, although this trend could
   potentially be overestimated. The findings contribute to a better
   understanding of the sensitivity of T to sST and facilitate the
   assessment of energy exchange between the land surface and the
   atmosphere in climate models.},

Title = {Decreasing trend of groundwater recharge with limited impact of intense
   precipitation: Evidence from long-term lysimeter data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {637},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Groundwater recharge is a key component of the hydrological cycle but it
   is a complex process difficult to observe. Direct observations are
   essential to improve our understanding of this process, and lysimeters
   are the only powerful tools to reach this goal. In this study, we
   analyze 45 years of drainage data from 10 lysimeters located in the
   north-east of France (Fagni \& egrave;res) in order to understand the
   mechanisms controlling groundwater recharge in this region. These
   observations enable to assess groundwater recharge behavior as a
   function of several factors: climate, land use and agricultural
   practices. In this study, we first parse the long-term evolution of the
   groundwater recharge as a function of all these factors, and secondly we
   conduct a specific analysis on the impact of intense precipitation
   events on lysimeters drainage. A decreasing trend of the groundwater
   recharge over the last 45 years (average of - 2.5 mm year -1 ) is found
   in relation to an increase in evapotranspiration which is in turn mainly
   driven by an increase in near surface air temperature and solar
   radiation, and a decrease of relative air humidity. Crop type and some
   agricultural practices (duration of rotation, catch crops) also impact
   the recharge rate. Finally, intense precipitation events represent 15\%
   of annual precipitations and on average 15\% of the recharge, while most
   of these events do not generate recharge because they occur mainly in
   summer. Only a few intense precipitation events in spring or summer time
   generate an important recharge event, and are associated with the most
   important accumulated precipitation.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change is projected to have different effects
   within and between countries. Information about such change is required
   at global, regional and basin scales for a variety of purposes. An
   investigation was carried out to identify trends in temperature time
   series of 125 stations distributed over the whole of India. The
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied to detect monotonic trends
   in annual average and seasonal temperatures. Three variables related to
   temperature, viz. mean, mean maximum and mean minimum, were considered
   for analysis on both an annual and a seasonal basis. Each year was
   divided into four principal seasons, viz. winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon
   and post-monsoon. The percentages of significant trends obtained for
   each parameter in the different seasons are presented. Temperature
   anomalies are plotted, and it is observed that annual mean temperature,
   mean maximum temperature and mean minimum temperature have increased at
   the rate of 0.42, 0.92 and 0.09degreesC (100 year)(-1), respectively. On
   a regional basis, stations of southern and western India show a rising
   trend of 1.06 and 0.36degreesC (100 year)(-1), respectively, while
   stations of the north Indian plains show a failing trend of
   -0.38degreesC (100 year)(-1). The seasonal mean temperature has
   increased by 0.94degreesC (100 year)(-1) for the post-monsoon season and
   by 1.1degreesC (100 year)(-1) for the winter season.},

Abstract = {A table of monthly mean temps. for the Lancashire plain from 1753 to the
   present day has been compiled by reduction from a large number of
   little-known early observations. It is believed that from 1781 onward
   the values are likely to be fairly reliable. The general trend of the
   mean temp. for each month agrees remarkably well with that shown to have
   occurred since about 1820 in Scandinavia. In general, there has been an
   upward trend of the mean monthly winter temperatures (e.g., the Jan.
   means have risen about 3 {[}degree]F since 1820), whereas there has been
   no appreciable change during the summer months. The overall rise in mean
   annual temp. since 1820 has been about 0.6{[}degree]F.},

Title = {Temperature trend and corporate cash holdings},
Journal = {FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 24},
Abstract = {We examine the causal impact of climate uncertainty on companies' cash
   holdings using local temperature trends. We find a notable increase in
   cash reserves among companies in response to rising climate-related
   risks. We also identify two significant channels through which climate
   uncertainty influences firms' cash management: heightened environmental
   enforcement risk and increased physical risk. Furthermore, we observe
   that the positive effect of temperature trends on cash holdings is more
   pronounced for financially constrained firms and those with a lower
   level of environmental protection awareness. External financing through
   equity and debt issuance, as well as cost reduction strategies involving
   research and development and selling, general, and administrative
   activities, represent viable avenues for firms to bolster their cash
   reserves. However, financially constrained firms are less inclined to
   build up cash reserves through debt financing. Our findings underscore
   the precautionary nature of corporate cash policies and shed light on
   how temperature fluctuations can significantly shape corporate behavior.},

Abstract = {Information on past and likely future trends in water temperature from
   different parts of the world is collated. The potential causes of trends
   in the thermal regimes of streams and rivers are many, but the existing
   database of water temperature information is inadequate to provide a
   global perspective on changes during the recent, let alone the more
   remote, past. Data from Europe suggest that warming of up to ca. 1
   degrees C in mean river temperatures has occurred during the 20th
   century, but that this trend has not been continuous, is distorted by
   extreme hydrological events, is not correlated with simple
   hydrometeorological factors and has been influenced by a variety of
   human activities. Predictive studies indicate that an accelerated rise
   in stream and river temperatures will occur during the next century as a
   consequence of global warming. However, forecasts must be tentative
   because future climatic conditions are uncertain and interactions
   between climate, hydrological and vegetation changes are complex.},

Abstract = {The hypothesis of an artificially exaggerated temperature trend in the

   comparison with four other records of temperature measured in the
   Australian region. The trends extracted from all five records are
   consistent, so the hypothesis of bias in the Bureau of Meteorology's
   Australian surface air temperature record cannot be sustained and is
   rejected. Using three different methods of trend estimation applied to
   five temperature anomaly time series, the anthropogenic contribution to
   warming of the Australian region since 1950 is determined to have
   occurred at a rate of 0.12 +/- 0.02K per decade, which translates to a
   total anthropogenic warming contribution of 0.78 +/- 0.13K over the
   period 1950 to 2015.},

Abstract = {Chennai is the fourth largest metropolitan city in India, and it is one
   of India's chief industrial and economic growth centers. The temperature
   change in Chennai is studied in this research by analyzing the mean
   maximum temperature (MMaxT), mean minimum temperature (MMinT), and mean
   annual temperature (MAT) from 1951 to 2010. Data are analyzed in three
   parts by running linear regression and by taking anomalies of all time
   periods: (a) the whole period from 1951 to 2010; (b) phase 1, 1951-1980;
   and (c) phase 2, 1981-2010. The trends have been evaluated by Student's
   t statistics and supported by Mann Kendall rank statistics. The observed
   change in temperature is positive, which has been clear increasing
   trends in MMaxT, MMinT, and MAT. MAT has increased 1.3A degrees C since
   the last 60 years. MMaxT has increased up to 1.6A degrees C, in which
   the second phase accounts for 75 \% of the total change during the last
   60 years. MMinT over Chennai has increased 1.0A degrees C. There is a
   high rise in temperature during winter season.},

Abstract = {If global warming is accelerating, then one might expect temperatures
   for most stations to be accelerating and perhaps variability to be
   increasing. In this study, we examine 57 New Zealand temperature time
   series for evidence of non-linearity and changing variability. These
   correspond to time series for annual minima, annual means and annual
   maxima for 19 stations. Estimation is by an extended least-squares
   method. We find a surprising diversity of behaviour of these series -
   presumably reflecting their different geographic factors as well as
   series length. We give evidence of regions where temperatures are
   decreasing. For series where a linear trend is significant, it is
   downwards in about one third of the cases. This proportion was higher in
   the South Island, especially for series of minima. Where a non-linear
   trend is significant, temperatures are decelerating in about one half of
   the cases. The ratio of downward to upward trends is highest among
   annual maxima and South Island minima and smallest in annual means.
   Where a linear trend in the variability is significant, it is decreasing
   in 13 cases and increasing in 5 cases, although possibly this is partly
   due to poorer quality data last century. Where a non-linear trend in the
   variability is significant, variability is decelerating in about two
   thirds of the cases. The results are used to project upper and lower
   return levels of minima, means and maxima for each of the series to the
   year 2010.},

Abstract = {Results are reported from simulations with an atmospheric general
   circulation model (GCM) covering the 20th century. These results focus
   primarily on the continental surface air temperature (SAT) record, with
   some discussion of large spatial scale precipitation averages as well.
   These experiments were conducted using the Max Planck Institute for
   Meteorology ECHAM3 GCM configured at triangular-21 truncation, giving a
   spatial resolution of approximately 5.5 degrees. The surface boundary
   conditions for the model were constructed by forming decadal
   climatologies of sea surface temperature (SST) data from the Global SST
   Atlas (GOSSTA) data set. No changes in greenhouse gas concentrations
   were made during the experiments. The GCM was then integrated for 5
   years with each climatology. Because the high southern latitudes are
   poorly sampled and show considerable high-amplitude variability in the
   GOSSTA data, two complete experiments were conducted. In one experiment
   the time-varying GOSSTA data were prescribed globally (the GLBL
   simulation), in the other, SSTs in the high southern latitudes were held
   at the 1950-1969 climatology (the NO-SH simulation). The results show
   both GCM simu(l)ations reproduce important features of the observed 20th
   century global temperature record, suggesting that the low-frequency
   variability in global average SAT is modulated to an important degree by
   variability in SSTs. In the model results, the changes in SST are
   transmitted to the atmosphere via latent heat flux, i.e., by changes in
   the flux of water through the hydrologic cycle. The most notable
   difference between the GLBL and NO-SH SAT records is that during the
   1920-1940 period the NO-SH results agree more closely with observations,
   while the GLBL results are superior from the 1950s forward. At least in
   part, these differences appear to be linked to differences in simulated
   sea-ice extent in the two simulations. Analyses of large-scale, averages
   in continental precipitation show good model-observation agreement in
   the tropics (+/-30 degrees latitude) and in the extratropical southern
   hemisphere; however, the upward trend in extratropical NH continental
   precipitation seen in the observed record is not reproduced in either
   simulation.},

Abstract = {A review of high temperature design guidelines has been carried out in
   preparation for designing a solar storage module for the Freedom
   Spacelab.  Three major guidelines, N47, R5 and RCC-MR form the basis of
   the survey.  The main issues with current, mature design in the power
   industry appear to be adequately covered by these guidelines.  A
   significant finding is that long established models of material damage
   have survived the test of time very well.  A new design regime referred
   to as Very High Temperature Design (VHTD) is identified.  The
   characteristics of this regime are changing material properties which
   require some changes in philosophy in drafting of future codes,
   particularly in regard to definitions of yield strengths and other
   design allowables.  Finally, there is some discussion of the more
   general use of the stress/strain plane, e.g. isochronous curves, for
   representation of very complex material constitutive behavior.  A
   concept called the `Relaxation Locus', which summarizes essential local
   constrained component behavior, is introduced and its application to
   high temperature design problems is discussed briefly.},

Abstract = {The hydroclimate of the Snowy Mountains, south-east Australia (SEA), is
   influenced by tropical and extra-tropical synoptic scale weather
   systems. Accordingly, it is sensitive to any changes in the mid-latitude
   westerly wind belt, the dominant driver of precipitation in winter, and
   the entrainment of moisture from tropical latitudes, particularly during
   the warmer months of the austral summer.
   The region has historically observed a cool-season (April-October)
   dominated precipitation regime, However, evidence is presented of a
   decline in precipitation during the autumn and spring transition months.
   Autumn precipitation is particularly important for crop sowing and
   agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin downstream of the
   Snowy Mountains, whilst spring precipitation influences snowmelt and
   water storage replenishment in the Snowy Mountains. Instead, we show a
   change in the annual precipitation distribution is evident with an
   increase in precipitation during warmer months.
   Trend analyses for the period 1958-2012 show a decrease in annual
   frequency of precipitation days capable of generating inflows to the
   catchments of the Snowy Mountains of -1.4 days per decade on average,
   whilst the precipitation they generate has increased by +5.7 mm per
   decade. These results align with climate change projections that
   precipitation events are becoming less frequent but more intense. (C)

Abstract = {Long-term changes of precipitation intensity were analyzed using a

   categories were defined so as to equate the total precipitation amount
   in each month at each station. The result is characterized by increase
   of precipitation in high categories, namely intense precipitation, and
   decrease in low categories. The linear trend for the highest and lowest
   categories is +/-20-30\% per century. This feature is found invariably
   for four-hourly, daily, and hourly precipitation, and qualitatively for

Title = {Human Influence on Winter Precipitation Trends (1921-2015) over North

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {46},
Number = {6},

Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Detecting and attributing a human influence on observed rainfall trends
   is a major challenge due to the presence of large amplitude internal
   variability on all time scales and by limited temporal and spatial data
   coverage. Here we apply a dynamical adjustment methodology to a gridded
   archive of monthly precipitation to estimate an anthropogenic influence
   on long-term (1920-2015) trends over North America and Eurasia during
   winter (November-March). This empirical approach aims to remove
   atmospheric circulation influences from precipitation variability and
   trends, thereby revealing the thermodynamically induced component as a
   residual. The geographical pattern and amplitude of this observed
   thermodynamic residual precipitation trend are in good agreement with
   anthropogenically forced trends obtained from ensembles of historical
   climate model simulations. Such consistency helps to reconcile
   observations and models and provides compelling evidence for a human
   influence on century-scale precipitation trends over North America and
   Eurasia during the cold season.
   Plain Language Summary It is difficult to isolate the anthropogenic
   influence on long-term precipitation trends due to confounding effects
   from internal variability. Here we remove the influence of atmospheric
   circulation variability, which is primarily unforced, from observed
   precipitation trends using an empirical approach called ``dynamical
   adjustment.{''} This removal isolates the thermodynamic component of
   observed precipitation trends as a residual. We find that this
   thermodynamic component is in good agreement with the anthropogenic
   component determined from historical simulations from climate models.
   Thus, we conclude that we are able to identify a human influence on
   observed century-scale precipitation trends over North America and
   Eurasia.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Studying long-term variations and trends in grid datasets is often
   complicated by variations in the station network used for spatial
   interpolation. The increase in station density over time gives rise to
   inhomogeneities in the datasets. Here we introduce a gridded dataset of
   monthly precipitation for the entire Alpine region with a grid-spacing
   of 5 km that extends over more than 100 years (1901-2008), is largely
   unaffected by network variations and still exploits information from
   recent dense observations. It is derived by a reconstruction procedure
   that combines data from several thousand stations over recent decades
   with long-term and almost continuous station series at much coarser
   resolution (120 stations). Our dataset is a recalculation and update of
   a previous and similarly constructed dataset that ended in 1990. The
   reconstruction method is modified for the present application and an
   entirely new high-resolution reference was used for calibration. The
   reconstruction explains more than 80\% of the month-by-month variance in
   Switzerland and Austria where the long-term station network is
   comparatively denser. We also demonstrate that the reconstruction can
   effectively filter out artifacts in trend patterns due to local
   inhomogeneities in the data and the station network. Precipitation
   trends calculated with the updated grid dataset are qualitatively
   similar with those found previously, but statistical significance has
   partly changed. A likely reason for these discrepancies is decadal
   variations, notably in winter, and this calls for prudence in the
   interpretation of trend results from conventional tests.},

Abstract = {Human induced long-term changes in precipitation and stream chemistry
   have been observed in eastern North America and Europe, but few
   long-term studies have been conducted in coastal western North America.
   The objectives of this research were to determine: (1) time trends in
   precipitation and stream chemistry in a pristine old-growth forest
   watershed, and (2) seasonal patterns in precipitation and stream
   chemistry. It was conducted in 58 ha West Twin Creek Watershed, Hoh
   River Valley, Olympic National Park, Washington from 1984 to 1993.
   Vegetation consists of old-growth forest, with western hemlock,
   Douglas-fir, western redcedar, Pacific silver fir, and Sitka spruce
   being the dominant tree species. Annual precipitation varied from 2336
   to 4518 mm during the study period with the majority of the rain falling
   between October and May. Chemistry of precipitation was strongly
   dominated by oceanic influences with Na and Cl being the dominant ions.
   The chemistry of the stream was influenced by bedrock weathering and was
   dominated by Ca, HCO3, and SO4 and was not strongly related to
   precipitation chemistry. The pH of precipitation averaged 5.3 over time
   and ranged from 4.3 to 7.1, while the stream pH averaged 7.5 and ranged
   from 5.5 to 9.0. There were few long-term trends in the chemical
   constituents of bulk precipitation or stream water with the exception of
   a slight decrease in NO3 in precipitation and an increase of SO4 in
   stream water. A trend of decreasing concentrations of Ca, Mg and Na in
   precipitation also occurred. There were no significant seasonal patterns
   in precipitation although the highest SO4 concentrations usually
   occurred in late spring and summer perhaps due marine algal activity.
   Strong seasonal trends occurred in concentrations of HCO3, SO4, Ca, Mg,
   and Na in stream water resulting from weathering and stream flow
   patterns, with highest ion concentrations occurring just before the
   onset of the rainy season. Pulses of NO3 in the stream were observed
   during fall and early winter resulting from the release of NO3 which had
   accumulated in soils or sediments.},

Abstract = {Several trends occurring in the past few years in our understanding of
   bias temperature instability (BTI) are reviewed. Among the most
   important is the shift toward analyzing BTI relaxation with the tools
   originally developed for describing low-frequency noise. This includes
   the interpretation of the time, temperature, voltage, and duty cycle
   dependences. It is shown that a wealth of information about gate oxide
   defect properties can be obtained from deeply scaled devices and
   correctly modeled based on nonradiative multiphonon theory. It is then
   shown how detailed understanding of individual defect properties can
   allow interpreting the variability issues of future complementary

Abstract = {Trends in surface temperature over the last 100, 50, and 30 yr at
   individual grid boxes in a 5' latitude-longitude grid are compared with
   model estimates of the natural internal variability of these trends and
   with the model response to increasing greenhouse gases and sulfate
   aerosols. Three different climate models are used to provide estimate's
   of the internal variability of trends, one of which appears to
   overestimate the observed variability of surface temperature at
   interannual and 5-yr time scales. Significant warming trends are found
   at a large fraction of the individual grid boxes over the globe, a much
   larger fraction than can be explained by internal climate variations.
   The observed warming trends over the last 50 and 30 yr are consistent
   with the modeled response to increasing greenhouse gases and sulfate
   aerosols in most of the models. However, in some regions, the observed
   century-scale trends are significantly larger than the modeled response
   to increasing greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere.
   Warming trends consistent with the response to anthropogenic forcing are
   detected at scales on the order of 500 km in many regions of the globe.},

Abstract = {We review the scientific literature since the 1960s to examine the
   evolution of modeling tools and observations that have advanced
   understanding of global stratospheric temperature changes. Observations
   show overall cooling of the stratosphere during the period for which
   they are available (since the late 1950s and late 1970s from radiosondes
   and satellites, respectively), interrupted by episodes of warming
   associated with volcanic eruptions, and superimposed on variations
   associated with the solar cycle. There has been little global mean
   temperature change since about 1995. The temporal and vertical structure
   of these variations are reasonably well explained by models that include
   changes in greenhouse gases, ozone, volcanic aerosols, and solar output,
   although there are significant uncertainties in the temperature
   observations and regarding the nature and influence of past changes in
   stratospheric water vapor. As a companion to a recent WIREs review of
   tropospheric temperature trends, this article identifies areas of
   commonality and contrast between the tropospheric and stratospheric
   trend literature. For example, the increased attention over time to
   radiosonde and satellite data quality has contributed to better
   characterization of uncertainty in observed trends both in the
   troposphere and in the lower stratosphere, and has highlighted the
   relative deficiency of attention to observations in the middle and upper
   stratosphere. In contrast to the relatively unchanging expectations of
   surface and tropospheric warming primarily induced by greenhouse gas
   increases, stratospheric temperature change expectations have arisen
   from experiments with a wider variety of model types, showing more
   complex trend patterns associated with a greater diversity of forcing
   agents. (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. WIREs Clim Change 2011 2

Abstract = {Our goal is to discuss the notion of multidimensional trend in the
   climate change context. Temperature series over Europe are used to
   derive non parametric trends in mean, variance and extremes. A criterion
   is proposed to compare the different trends, and a general methodology
   is applied to test if the trends in extremes are only due to the trends
   in the central field, as mean and variance ones. Examples are given
   which show that the temporal evolution in mean and variance of the
   temperature time series are linked, and that generally these evolutions
   explain a large part of the temporal evolution of the extremes.},

Title = {Scaling and trends of hourly precipitation extremes in two different
   climate zones - Hong Kong and the Netherlands},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3033-3041},
Abstract = {Hourly precipitation extremes in very long time series from the Hong
   Kong Observatory and the Netherlands are investigated. Using the 2 m dew
   point temperature from 4 h before the rainfall event as a measure of
   near surface absolute humidity, hourly precipitation extremes closely
   follow a 14\% per degree dependency - a scaling twice as large as
   following from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. However, for dew point
   temperatures above 23 degrees C no significant dependency on humidity
   was found. Strikingly, in spite of the large difference in climate,
   results are almost identical in Hong Kong and the Netherlands for the
   dew point temperature range where both observational sets have
   sufficient data. Trends in hourly precipitation extremes show
   substantial increases over the last century for both De Bilt (the
   Netherlands) and Hong Kong. For De Bilt, not only the long term trend,
   but also variations in hourly precipitation extremes on an inter-decadal
   timescale of 30 yr and longer, can be linked very well to the above
   scaling; there is a very close resemblance between variations in dew
   point temperature and precipitation intensity with an inferred
   dependency of hourly precipitation extremes of 10 to 14\% per degree.
   For Hong Kong there is no connection between variations in humidity and
   those in precipitation intensity in the wet season, May to September.
   This is consistent with the found zero-dependency of precipitation
   intensity on humidity for dew points above 23 degrees C. Yet, outside
   the wet season humidity changes do appear to explain the positive trend
   in hourly precipitation extremes, again following a dependency close to
   twice the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.},

Abstract = {The climatic variability and trends of precipitation in Iceland are
   examined for the period 1961-2000 using bias-corrected rain gauge data
   and precipitation forecasts from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40).
   Several quantities are studied: the monthly and annual precipitation
   amounts as well as the statistical characteristics of 12-hourly
   precipitation rate and the geometrical features of the precipitation
   fields. The study highlights the credibility of ERA-40 and its ability
   to capture in a realistic manner the climatic variability of
   precipitation in Iceland, despite local discrepancies related to the
   crude horizontal resolution of these data. The observed intra- and
   interannual variations in the precipitation characteristics can be
   linked to variations in size, location, and occurrence of the
   large-scale precipitation systems crossing Iceland that are in turn
   influenced by the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation, especially
   in winter.},

Abstract = {The chemical composition of pollutant species in precipitation sampled
   daily or weekly at 10 sites in Ireland for the five-year period,
   1994-1998, is presented. Sea salts accounted for 81\% of the total ionic
   concentration. Approximately 50\% of the SO42- in precipitation was from
   sea-salt sources. The proportion of sea salts in precipitation decreased
   sharply eastwards. In contrast, the concentration of NO3- and the
   proportion of non-sea-salt SO42- increased eastwards reflecting the
   closer proximity to major emission sources. The mean (mol(c)) ratio of
   SO42-:NO3- was 1.6 for all sites, indicating that SO42- was the major
   acid anion.
   The spatial correlation between SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in
   precipitation was statistically significant. The regional trend in NO3-
   concentration was best described by linear regression against easting.
   SO42- concentration followed a similar pattern. However, the regression
   was improved by inclusion of elevation, Inclusion of northing in the
   regression did not significantly improve any of the relationships except
   for NH4+, indicating a significant increase in concentrations from
   northwest to southeast.
   The spatial distribution of deposition fluxes showed similar gradients
   increasing from west and southwest to east and northeast. However, the
   pattern of deposition shows the influence of precipitation volume in
   determining the overall input, Mean depositions of sulphur and nitrogen
   in precipitation were approximate to30 ktonnes S yr(-1) and 48 ktonnes N
   yr(-1) over the five-year period, 1994-1998, for Ireland.
   Least-squares linear regression analysis indicated a slight decreasing
   trend in precipitation concentrations for 4 (20\%), NO3- (13\%) and H+
   (24\%) and a slight increasing trend for NH4+ (15\%), over the period
   1991-1998. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {At present, the problem of climate change is becoming increasingly
   acute. This is especially pressing for Lake Baikal, a World Natural
   Heritage site. The Russian part of the Selenga watershed is a suitable
   site for climate change research. The study of changes in precipitation,
   runoff, and chemical runoff is important for sustainable water resources
   management. This study presents a trend analysis of precipitation and
   runoff at hydrological stations and weather stations in the Russian part
   of the Selenga River basin. A comparative analysis of the concentrations
   of major ions in the surface water of the Selenga River depending on
   water levels was also carried out. Analysis of the data series on
   precipitation revealed a slight negative trend at the Novoselenginsk,
   Ulan-Ude, and Kabansk stations, and a weak positive trend-at the Kyakhta
   station. Runoff analysis revealed negative trends at the two used
   stations (Novoselenginsk and Mostovoi). The hydrochemical regime of the
   Selenga River is characterized by an increase in major ions and salinity
   during winter low-water periods, and a decrease during high-water
   periods. Mineralization and major ion content are lower in the
   high-water period (2019-2021) than in the low-water period (2015-2017).},

Title = {Gross Discrepancies between Observed and Simulated
   Twentieth-to-Twenty-First-Century Precipitation Trends in Southeastern
   South America},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {Southeastern South America (SESA; encompassing Paraguay, southern
   Brazil, Uruguay, and northern Argentina) experienced a 27\% increase in
   austral summer precipitation from 1902 to 2019, one of the largest
   observed trends in seasonal precipitation globally. Previous research
   identifies Atlantic multidecadal variability and anthropogenic forcing
   from stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse gas emissions as key
   factors contributing to the positive precipitation trends in SESA. We
   analyze multimodel ensemble simulations from phases 5 and 6 of the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and find that not only do
   Earth system models simulate positive SESA precipitation trends that are
   much weaker over the historical interval, but some models persistently
   simulate negative SESA precipitation trends under historical forcings.
   Similarly, 16-member ensembles from two atmospheric models forced with
   observed historical sea surface temperatures never simulate
   precipitation trends that even reach the lower bound of the observed
   trend's range of uncertainty. Moreover, while future
   twenty-first-century projections from CMIP6 yield positive ensemble mean
   precipitation trends over SESA that grow with increasing greenhouse gas
   emissions, the mean forced response never exceeds the observed
   historical trend. Preindustrial control runs from CMIP6 indicate that
   some models do occasionally simulate centennial-scale trends in SESA
   that fall within the observational range, but most models do not.
   Results point to significant uncertainties in the attribution of
   anthropogenically forced influences on the observed increases in
   precipitation over SESA while also suggesting that internal
   decadal-to-centennial variability of unknown origin and not present in
   state-of-the-art models may have also played a large role in generating
   the twentieth-to-twenty-first-century SESA precipitation trend.},

Title = {Attribution of changes in the trend and temporal non-uniformity of
   extreme precipitation events in Central Asia},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Extreme precipitation events exhibit an increasing trend for both the
   frequency and magnitude on global and regional scales and it has already
   proven the impact of man-made global warming on the extreme
   precipitation amplification. Based on the observed datasets and global
   climate model (GCM) output, this study has evaluated the impact from
   anthropogenic forcing on the trend and temporal non-uniformity (i.e.
   increase in unevenness or disparity) of the precipitation amounts
   (PRCPTOT), extremes (R95p and RX5day) and intensity (SDII) in Central
   Asia (CA) from 1961 to 2005. Results indicate that radiative forcing
   changes, mainly driven by human activities, have significantly augmented
   the extreme precipitation indices in CA. The median trend with the
   influence of anthropogenic activities for the PRCPTOT, SDII, R95p and
   RX5day amounted to 2.19 mm/decade, 0.019 mm/decade, 1.39 mm/decade and
   0.21 mm/decade during the study period, respectively. A statistically
   insignificant decrease in non-uniformity was noticed for the PRCPTOT,
   SDII and RX5day in Central CA (CCA) and Western CA (WCA), while Eastern
   CA (ECA) was the only region with a statistically significant increase
   in non-uniformity of the PRCPTOT, SDII, R95p and RX5day by 4.22\%,
   3.98\%, 3.73\% and 3.97\%, respectively from 1961 to 2005 due to
   anthropogenic forcing. These results reflect the difference in various
   regions regarding the impact of anthropogenic forcing on the
   non-uniformity of extreme precipitation events in CA, which might help
   to fully understand the role of anthropogenic forcing in the changes of
   the precipitation extremes in CA and contribute to the development of
   water resource management strategies.},

Abstract = {Hydrological climate variables such as precipitation, temperature,
   humidity, evapotranspiration, infiltration, and streamflow provide
   useful information for the effective planning, design, and management of
   water resources. In the present study, monthly precipitation and
   streamflow data were analyzed to assess the variability in trends of
   precipitation over the Upper Narmada Basin (UNB), Middle Narmada Basin
   (MNB), and Lower Narmada Basin (LNB) for 41 years (1981-2021) using the
   widely accepted Mann-Kendall Test (MKT), Innovative Trend Analysis
   (ITA), and magnitude by Sen's Slope estimator, thereby extending further
   by a decade, the last study by Thomas et al. (2015). The inclusion of
   more factors affecting the streamflow in response to the rainfall often
   makes the model very complex and unreliable. In the present study, to
   overcome this limitation, a simple yet most definite correlation was
   established between rainfall and streamflow, which can serve as a
   meaningful indicator of basin behavior. Poor correlation was observed
   for the UNB and the MNB compared to the LNB, which may be attributed to
   the presence of tributaries. The result of this study will be helpful to
   policymakers and water resource managers to plan and adopt suitable
   schemes of water conservation and management in the Narmada basin.},

Abstract = {Trends and variability of extreme precipitation events are important for
   water-related disaster prevention and mitigation as well as water
   resource management. Using daily precipitation dataset from 143
   meteorological stations in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), a suite of
   heavy and extreme precipitation indices recommended by the Expert Team
   on Climate Change Detection and Indices, which has rarely been applied
   in this region, were analysed during 1960-2012. Results showed that
   simple daily intensity index, very wet day precipitation, extremely wet
   day precipitation, extremely heavy precipitation days, maximum 1-day
   precipitation, maximum 5-day precipitation and maximum consecutive dry
   days all increased significantly during 1960-2012. In contrast, 10mm
   precipitation days and maximum consecutive wet days decreased
   significantly, implying that the precipitation processes in YRB were
   dominated by precipitation events with shorter durations.
   Geographically, a wetting tendency was observed in the eastern Tibet
   Plateau and the middle and lower YRB, while the other regions
   experienced precipitation deficits. The increasing precipitation was
   mainly due to the intensification of extreme precipitation events and
   the decreasing precipitation may be attributed to the decrease of 10mm
   precipitation days or moderate precipitation events. In addition, the
   regional trends were of greater magnitudes in the middle and lower YRB,
   indicating more frequent extreme precipitation events in these
   sub-regions. Time series analysis revealed that most precipitation
   indices exhibited neither a stable nor a gradual pattern during
   1960-2012, but a clearly upward trend, although non-monotonous, since
   the late-1980s was evident.},

Title = {Long-term trends in streamwater and precipitation chemistry at five
   headwater basins in the northeastern United States},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Stream water data from five headwater basins in the northeastern United
   States covering water years 1968-1996 and precipitation data from eight
   nearby precipitation monitoring sites covering water years 1984-1996
   were analyzed for temporal trends in chemistry using the nonparametric
   seasonal Kendall test. Concentrations of SO4 declined at three of five
   streams during 1968-1996 (p < 0.1), and all of the streams exhibited
   downward trends in SO4 over the second half of the period (1984-1996).
   Concentrations of SO4 in precipitation declined at seven of eight sites
   from 1984 to 1996, and the magnitudes of the declines (-0.7 to -2.0 mu
   eq L-1 yr(-1)) generally were similar to those of stream water SO4.
   These results indicate that changes in precipitation SO4 were of
   sufficient magnitude to account for changes in stream water SO4.
   Concentrations of Ca + Mg declined at three of five streams and five of
   eight precipitation sites from 1984 to 1996. Precipitation acidity
   decreased at five of eight sites during the same period, but alkalinity
   increased in only one stream. In most cages the decreases in stream
   water SO4 were similar in magnitude to declines in stream water Ca + Mg,
   which is consistent with the theory of leaching by mobile acid anions in
   soils. In precipitation the magnitudes of SO4 declines were similar to
   those of hydrogen, and declines in Ca + Mg were much smaller. This
   indicates that recent decreases in SO4 deposition are now being
   reflected in reduced precipitation acidity. The lack of widespread

Title = {Six-decade trend in minute-scale short-duration intense precipitation in
   Beijing and its association with urbanization},

Abstract = {Understanding the characteristics of minute-scale short-duration intense
   rainfall and its possible link with urbanization is valuable for
   addressing urban climate change and evaluating biases in high-resolution
   historical precipitation data series. This study analyses the long-term
   trends of rainy-season minute-scale intense rainfall events at different
   continuous time periods based on precipitation data from 20 national
   meteorological stations in the Beijing area covering the period from
   1961 to 2021. This study shows that during the whole period analysed,
   the number of events of intense rainfall lasting 15 min or longer
   decreased, while the number of shorter-duration events and the
   accumulated precipitation increased. The frequency and amount of
   minute-scale intense rainfall recorded by urban stations are generally
   higher than those recorded by rural stations in terms of climatological
   means. The signal of the urbanization effect in minute-scale
   precipitation changes is detectable, with the contribution of
   urbanization to the trends in average precipitation of 30-min intense
   rainfall being 68.8\%, whereas the contributions with respect to the
   frequency of 20- and 30-min intense rainfall and the maximum
   precipitation of intense rainfall with a duration of 45 min reach 100\%.
   The results of the analysis can provide reference for understanding
   long-term changes in short-duration rainfall and the possibility that
   they are driven by local anthropogenic activity, as well as bias in the
   minute-scale precipitation data series of urban observation sites when
   they are used in studies of large-scale intense precipitation changes.
   The intensity of the short-duration intense rainfall events from 15 to
   60 min at urban stations is becoming larger from 1961 to 2021. For
   slightly longer durations, the urban stations generally have a higher
   average precipitation and maximum precipitation than those at rural
   stations. It is notable that the urbanization contribution could reach
   100\% for the increased frequency in some intense rainfall events. image},

Title = {Quantitative assessment of the variations in monthly precipitation
   trends induced by the impact of three gorges dam},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There are many studies that have examined the impact of the Three Gorges
   Dam (TGD) on changes in meteorological data, and most of them concluded
   that the TGD significantly reduced precipitation without taking into
   account the negative trends that had already existed before the
   impoundment. In this study, the investigation focused on the monthly
   precipitation data, and the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend analysis was
   conducted to show that the TGD had little effect on the trends of the
   precipitation data. Monthly data (1980-2018) from 19 stations upstream
   and downstream of the TGD and 5 stations located far from the main river
   were extracted. The analysis and results showed that although the linear
   long-term (1980-2018) precipitation trend upstream of the TGD was
   downward, the MK trend analysis showed that the precipitation trends
   became upward after impoundment. This situation existed even for station
   data located outside the region. Also, the analysis of monthly trends in
   different seasons showed that in spring and winter, there was only a
   very weak downward trend in monthly precipitation, while in summer and
   autumn, the trends were upward with steeper slopes. Following the upward
   trends of the monthly precipitation, the TGD generally positively
   intensified the monthly precipitation trends upstream and downstream of
   the dam, with the exception of a few months when total precipitation
   amounts were consistently low. In contrast to the trend analysis, which
   showed small and insignificant variations in precipitation data, the
   12-month SPEI analysis showed a significant deterioration (about 20\%)
   in the wetness index after impoundment both upstream and downstream of
   the TGD, while this situation did not occur outside the region. Thus,
   the TGD has extended dry periods both upstream and downstream of the dam
   over the past two decades.},

Abstract = {Throughout the geological history of the earth, there have been many
   climate changes due to natural and external factors. In the past, the
   changes in climate were caused by natural causes, and today it is
   primarily caused by human activities. Besides being different climate
   types, Turkey is among countries that will be affected by climate change
   induced by global warming. Climate changes in the regions will be
   affected differently and degrees due to the country's surroundings by
   seas, fragmented topography and orographic features. Trend analysis
   methods are used in many areas such as on various engineering,
   agriculture, environmental and water resources, especially in climate
   change impact studies resulting from global warming. When data are
   analyzed with classical trend analysis methods, forward-looking
   predictions are generally made as low, medium, high, decreasing and
   increasing. However, risk classes showing changes between available data
   sets are not known. Innovative Trend Pivot Analysis Method (ITPAM)
   determines risk classes by establishing a relationship between data.
   Furthermore, in this method, increasing and decreasing trend regions are
   separated into five classes more clearly than classical/traditional
   trend methods. In this study, Susurluk Basin's total monthly
   precipitation data (2006-2017) were analyzed by using ITPAM which the
   newest trend method. When arithmetic mean analysis results are examined,
   a significant change is observed between first data set and second data
   set at two stations (Bandirma and Uludag). When examined at other
   stations, it is observed that at least one month of almost every station
   is in 1st degree risk group. When standard deviation analysis results of
   each station are examined, a significant change is observed between
   first data set and second data set at many stations. Because while trend
   class of a point in developed IPTA graph is the medium degree, this
   point is in 1st risk class in the risk graph.},

Title = {Long-term trends of nitrogen concentration and the influence of
   precipitation in Tianjin coastal waters of China},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {244},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Analysis of seawater quality variation and its influencing factors can
   be used to produce pollution management policies and help to evaluate
   the effects of nutrient reduction efforts. In this study, the
   generalized additive models for water quality trend analysis were
   established based on the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN)
   concentration and precipitation data of Tianjin coastal waters for the
   2007-2018 period. The variation of DIN in 12 stations located in Tianjin
   coastal waters and the response to precipitation were evaluated. The
   contribution of precipitation was distinguished from other possible
   driving factors. Results showed that the water quality in the coastal
   waters of Tianjin was gradually improving in 2013-2018, compared with
   2007-2012. At the 95\% confidence level, the DIN concentration in 7 of
   the 12 stations was declining, one was on the rise, and the other four
   stations showed no significant change, indicating that the pollutant
   emission reduction measures have achieved initial results in improving
   the sea water quality. The change of DIN concentration in all stations
   was less affected by precipitation, mainly controlled by other factors.
   The farther offshore, the less the impact of precipitation on DIN
   concentration in the sea water. The change in DIN over the period of
   record ranged from a decrease of 39.95\% to an increase of 29.79\%. The
   coastal areas were divided into five regions based on the analysis
   results. It is suggested to strengthen water quality management in the
   north and south districts of coastal areas, enhance the prevention and
   control of water pollution in the associated watersheds and reduce
   nutrients into the sea, in order to reverse the deterioration trend of
   water quality in the two regions.},

Title = {Long-term elemental trends in drip waters from monitoring Bunker Cave:
   New insights for past precipitation variability},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {590},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {A seven-year (2006-2013) monitoring was conducted in Bunker Cave,
   northwest Germany. The monitoring programme incorporates cave air
   temperature, the amount of precipitation, drip rates at five drip sites
   (TS 1, 2, 3, 5, 8) in the cave, and the analyses of cation (Ca2+, Mg2+,
   S-r2+, Na+, K+) and anion (HCO3-, NO3-, SO42-, Cl-) concentrations of
   rain, soil, and drip waters with a monthly (2006-2011) and bimonthly
   (2012-2013) interval. Further, the Ca, Mg, and Sr concentrations of the
   two host rock components, limestone and dolomite, were analysed.
   The analysis of rain, soil, and drip waters allowed to distinguish
   between geogenic and anthropogenic influences on the hydrochemistry of
   the cave. The limestone is the source of Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, and HCO3- in
   all drip waters, as well as SO42- from pyrite dissolution from the
   limestone. Chloride and NO3- were inserted by anthropogenic sources such
   as aerosols from mad salt, fertilisers, and industry. Drip site TS 1
   shows a strong seasonal drip rate, which is simultaneous with a seasonal
   variation in ion concentrations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, HCO3-, SO42-, induced
   by younger water transported by fracture flow during episodes of fast
   drip rates. Drip water at drip site TS 5 is recharged by water which
   probably dissolves prior calcite precipitation (PCP), resulting in low
   and constant Mg2+ and Sr2+ concentrations. Drip water at drip sites TS
   2, 3, and 8 are mainly influenced by PCP, whereas drip waters at TS 2
   and 8 are additionally influenced by incongruent dolomite dissolution
   indicated by their increasing Mg2+ and stable Sr2+ concentrations.
   Furthermore, Cl- and SO42- concentrations show increasing and decreasing
   long-term trends for these three PCP-influenced drip waters at sites TS
   2, 3, and 8, respectively.
   The decreasing pattern in infiltration/precipitation from 2000 to 2013
   is not very pronounced; however, the continuous draining of the aquifer
   is visible in the decreasing drip rates over the seven-year monitoring
   period. This is reflected in the long-term increasing trends of Mg/Ca,
   Sr/Ca ratios induced by PCP, and Cl- concentrations, as well as in the
   decreasing long-term trend of the SO42- concentrations in drip waters of
   drip sites TS 2, 3, and 8.
   For a better understanding of the cave system with its complex
   processes, a multi-element-proxy long-term cave monitoring of rain,
   soil, and drip waters appears to be a reasonable step to be followed by
   the interpretation of the element proxies of speleothems. This
   monitoring emphasizes Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios, as well as Cl- and in
   particular SO42- concentrations as potential past
   infiltration/precipitation proxies. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios are the
   strongest proxies to reconstruct infiltration/precipitation of measured
   elements in stalagmites, in cases Sr/Ca is not overprinted by growth
   rate influences. In addition, the sulphur concentration in speleothems
   may be an infiltration/precipitation proxy in the case of a geogenic
   source from the host rock.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal trend variability in extreme precipitation indices
   was studied for the meteorological seasons from 1951 to 2006. Eight
   indices were used, describing their frequency (90pNoD, 95pNoD), totals
   (1dayT, 5dayT, 90pT, 95pT) and intensity (90pInt, 95pInt). The following
   key challenges were addressed: (1) temporal variability in the relative
   number of stations with significant 30-year trends, (2) temporal
   stability and (3) average magnitude of the calculated 30-year trends.
   Temporal changes in the spatial extent of statistically significant
   extreme precipitation trends proceeded differently in each season. The
   trend direction, indicated by trend stability analysis, was consistent
   with that of averaged 30-year trend magnitudes at most stations. A
   distinct spatial differentiation emerged in the prevailing trend
   directions between the eastern and the western part of the study area.
   In all seasons, increasing trends in extreme precipitation dominated in
   central-eastern Germany, whereas opposite trends prevailed in southern
   Poland. This pattern was particularly prominent in winter. Similarities
   in the temporal variability of the percentage of significant trends
   between the eastern and the western sub-regions emerged in autumn only.
   Summer was characterized by the most pronounced temporal changes in the
   percentage of significant negative trends. Summer also showed the most
   stable extreme precipitation trends of all seasons and a higher trend
   magnitude than the transitional seasons. Spatial patterns of trend
   directions in spring, showing the most complex pattern of all seasons,
   vary depending on the index, particularly with respect to trend
   stability. Copyright (c) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Diminishing Arctic sea ice has led to enhanced evaporation from the
   Arctic marginal seas (AMS), which is expected to alter precipitation
   over land. In this work, AMS evaporation is numerically tracked to
   quantify its contribution to cold-season (October-March) precipitation
   over land in the Northern Hemisphere during 1980-2021. Results show a
   significant 32\% increase in AMS moisture contribution to land
   precipitation, corresponding to a 16\% increase per million square km
   loss of sea ice area. Especially over the high-latitude land, despite
   the fractional contribution of AMS to precipitation being relatively low
   (8\%), the augmented AMS evaporation contributed disproportionately
   (42\%) to the observed upward trend in precipitation. Notably, northern
   East Siberia exhibited a substantial rise in both the amount and
   fraction of extreme snowfall sourced from the AMS. Our findings
   underscore the importance of the progressively ice-free Arctic as an
   important contributor to the escalating levels of cold-season
   precipitation and snowfall over northern high-latitude land.},

Title = {Contrasting Trends in Convective and Large-Scale Precipitation in the
   Intertropical Convergence Zone From Reanalysis Data Sets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {128},

Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {We investigated long-term trends in convective and large-scale
   precipitation within the Intertropical Convergence Zone during the
   boreal summer (June-August) for the period 1980-2020 using five
   different reanalysis datasets. We found that there exists a large
   diversity in the trends. In particular, we focused on the European
   Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis version 5 (ERA5)
   and the Japanese 55-year reanalysis (JRA55) datasets; because the
   convective precipitation amount statistically significantly decreases in
   the former, but increases in the later. In contrast, the large-scale
   precipitation amount increases in both of these reanalysis datasets. We
   examine the physical factors leading to contrasting features in the
   respective trends in convective and large-scale precipitation amount
   between two reanalysis datasets. A significant decrease of convective
   available potential energy, which is caused by enhanced atmospheric
   stability, leads to a decreasing trend of convective precipitation
   amount in the ERA5 dataset. In contrast, a significant increase of
   precipitable water is noted in JRA55 dataset. Additionally, the
   Clausius-Clapeyron relation is larger in JRA55 than ERA5, implying that
   the sensitivity of humidity to the temperature change is larger in JRA55
   than that in ERA5 dataset. On the other hand, the increase of the
   large-scale precipitation is associated with the increase of medium
   cloud amount in both ERA5 and JRA55 datasets.Plain Language Summary
   Typically, the total amount of precipitation is divided into convective
   precipitation and large-scale precipitation in which the associated
   mechanisms are quite different. We investigated long-term trends in
   convective and large-scale precipitation within the Intertropical
   Convergence Zone, where tropical rainfall is concentrated in a narrow
   band that accounts for 32\% of global precipitation, during the boreal
   summer for 1980-2020 using five different reanalysis datasets. We
   focused on the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   reanalysis version 5 and the Japanese 55-year reanalysis datasets;
   because the convective precipitation amount decreases significantly in
   the former, but increases in the later. In contrast, the large-scale
   precipitation amount increases in both of these reanalysis datasets. The
   interesting challenge in these results is that there is little agreement
   in the mechanisms for those trends and this disagreement is most notable
   in terms of convective precipitation. If our reanalysis products
   disagree in terms of mechanisms for the trends, understanding future
   projections will be even more difficult.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Characteristics and Trend Prediction of Extreme
   Precipitation-Taking the Dongjiang River Basin as an Example},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The intricate interplay between human activities and climate change has
   resulted in a rise in the occurrence of extreme precipitation worldwide,
   which has attracted extensive attention. However, there has been limited
   dissemination of accurate prediction of extreme precipitation based on
   analysis of spatio-temporal characteristics of such events. In this
   study, the intra-annual distribution of extreme precipitation was
   subjected to scrutiny via an analysis of precipitation concentration
   degree (PCD) and precipitation concentration period (PCP), while also
   investigating the spatio-temporal trends of the annual precipitation,
   maximum daily precipitation, maximum 5-day precipitation, and extreme
   precipitation (defined as daily precipitation exceeding the 99th
   percentile of the total precipitation). Furthermore, subsequently,
   conducting simulation, verification, and prediction of extreme
   precipitation was achieved through the application of a back-propagation
   artificial neural network (BP-ANN). This study employed the data of the
   daily precipitation in the Dongjiang River Basin from 1979 to 2022, a
   time period which was of sufficient length to reflect the latest changes
   in precipitation patterns. The results demonstrated spatio-temporal
   differences between precipitation levels in the upper and lower reaches
   of the Dongjiang River Basin, that is, the PCD of the lower reach was
   higher and the PCP of the lower reach came half a month later compared
   with the upper reach. Moreover, the extreme precipitation indices
   increased from northeast to southwest, with the characteristics of
   lower-reach precipitation being more extreme and periodic. It was
   predicted that the total precipitation in 2023 would decrease, while the
   extreme precipitation would increase. The qualification rate of
   forecasting extreme precipitation ranged from 27\% to 72\%.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2015},
Abstract = {Accurately predicting precipitation trends is vital in the economic
   development of a country. This research investigated precipitation
   variability across 15 stations in the Swat River basin, Pakistan, over a
   51-year study period (1961-2011). Nonparametric MannKendall (MK) and
   Spearman's rho (SR) statistical tests were used to detect trends in
   monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation, and the trend-free
   prewhitening approach was applied to eliminate serial correlation in the
   precipitation time series. The results highlighted a mix of positive
   (increasing) and negative (decreasing) trends in monthly, seasonal, and
   annual precipitation. One station in particular, the Saidu Sharif
   station, showed the maximum number of significant monthly precipitation
   events, followed by Abazai, Khairabad, and Malakand. On the seasonal
   time scale, precipitation trends changed from the summer to the autumn
   season. The Saidu Sharif station revealed the highest positive trend
   (7.48 mm/ year) in annual precipitation. In the entire Swat River basin,
   statistically insignificant trends were found in the subbasins for the
   annual precipitation series; however, the Lower Swat subbasin showed
   themaximumquantitative increase in the precipitation at a rate of
   2.18mm/ year. The performance of theMK and SR tests was consistent at
   the verified significance level.},

Abstract = {Based on the daily precipitation data of 27 meteorological stations from
   1960 to 2009 in the Huaihe River Basin, spatio-temporal trend and
   statistical distribution of extreme precipitation events in this area
   are analyzed. Annual maximum series (AM) and peak over threshold series
   (POT) are selected to simulate the probability distribution of extreme
   precipitation. The results show that positive trend of annual maximum
   precipitation is detected at most of used stations, only a small number
   of stations are found to depict a negative trend during the past five
   decades, and none of the positive or negative trend is significant. The
   maximum precipitation event almost occurred in the flooding period
   during the 1960s and 1970s. By the L-moments method, the parameters of
   three extreme distributions, i.e., Generalized extreme value
   distribution (GEV), Generalized Pareto distribution (GP) and Gamma
   distribution are estimated. From the results of goodness of fit test and
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, AM series can be better fitted by GEV
   model and POT series can be better fitted by GP model. By the comparison
   of the precipitation amounts under different return levels, it can be
   found that the values obtained from POT series are a little larger than
   the values from AM series, and they can better simulate the observed
   values in the Huaihe River Basin.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study is to quantify the effect of climate change
   on the climatic risks associated with droughts and diminished water
   resources in the eastern Iberian Peninsula. For this purpose, this work
   analyses the 70-year historical series (1952-2021) of daily rainfall
   data from 353 meteorological stations. They are located in a key
   recharge area of the hydrological system, the Sierra de Albarracin,
   where three important rivers originate, namely the Tagus, the Jucar and
   the Turia, as do several tributaries of the Guadiana and Ebro rivers. It
   analyses trends in: annual and seasonal rainfall volumes with specific
   studies about their intensity according to certain percentiles; the
   number of rainy days, dry spell duration (< 1 mm/day) and drought
   evolution with the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index. The
   most relevant results are: (1) the second 35 years of the study period
   (1987-2021) were notably drier than the first part (1952-1986), with
   smaller volumes and fewer days with recorded precipitation; (2) summer
   and winter were most affected by pluviometric decrease, with losses of
   >50\% of rainfall volume at some stations; (3) moderate rainfall
   significantly reduced between the 50th and 95th percentiles, which were
   more important in the system's water recharge; (4) the stations with a
   negative pre-cipitation trend predominated; (5) the medium-and long-term
   analyses (12 and 36 months) highlighted the drought situation in which
   the headwaters of the analyzed basins are immersed. The trend indicates
   that the situation will become critical.},

Abstract = {Contemporary climate change causes an increase in the sensitivity of
   urban areas to the effects of this change, manifested in the increased
   threat of periods of both shortage and surplus of water or a higher
   probability of flood or drought occurrence. That is why Polish Ministry
   of the Environment is currently implementing project aimed at developing
   in major Polish cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants Urban
   Adaptation Plans that would reduce the city's vulnerability to climate
   change. One of the elements of preparing such plans is the assessment of
   the city's exposure to the effects of changes in rainfall conditions.
   Therefore, it is extremely important to know the trends of these
   changes. The analysis of the variability of selected precipitation
   characteristics was carried out for 24 Polish cities with more than
   100,000 inhabitants. The tendencies of annual and seasonal precipitation
   changes, the number of days with precipitation, the number of days with
   extreme precipitation (events exceeding the 19712000 95th percentile of
   daily precipitation) as well as the fraction of annual total
   precipitation due to extreme precipitation have been characterized.
   Annual trends were calculated using standard linear regression method
   and its statistical significance at the 95\% confidence level was
   assessed with the help of F Snedecor probability distribution. Changes
   in precipitation characteristics show mixed patterns. In the majority of
   analyzed cities, annual precipitation totals tend to decrease, however,
   there is no clear spatial pattern. In general, seasonal tendencies of
   summer and winter precipitation, and especially autumn precipitation,
   also show negative tendencies. However, the sums of precipitation in the
   spring season are generally characterized by positive tendencies. In the
   vast majority of analyzed cities, the number of days with precipitation
   decreases, as well as the number of days with extreme precipitation.
   Decreasing or stable precipitation together with increasing air
   temperature may result in water insecurity in many Polish cities.},

Abstract = {The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a powerful tool, requiring
   only precipitation data for calculating the intensity, duration,
   magnitude, severity and frequency of drought. Moreover, it provides
   helpful coverage of drought impacts on multi time scales. In this study,
   the SPI technique was applied to the dataset of 30 years (1986-2015) to
   detect drought condition in Northern Pakistan, which is a frequent
   drought-hit area. The coefficient of variability (CV) was used to
   analyze precipitation trend, while linear regression model was adopted
   to detect trend. The detected precipitation variability was spatially
   interpolated by applying the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) technique.
   It is evident from the analysis that there is great variability in
   precipitation pattern and trend in the study area. During the winter
   season, a positive trend in the precipitation variability was detected
   in the Himalaya and Karakorum region. In the Hindukush region, only
   Pattan weather station has observed a positive variability trend. In
   contrast to winter variability, pre-monsoon season has observed an
   increased variability in the Hindukush region, while the Karakorum and
   Himalayas regions observed a negative trend. The monsoon season has
   observed a decreased variation in precipitation throughout the study
   area except for Pattan. In post-monsoon, Skardu weather station of
   Himalayas, Gupis and Bunji of Karakorum region and Pattan of Hindukush
   region have witnessed increased precipitation variability. The
   meteorological stations of Karakoram and Himalaya have noticed a
   negative trend of precipitation variability, while in the Hindukush
   region, all the meteorological stations have witnessed a positive trend
   of variability except Saidu Sharif and Dir stations. The results of SPI
   also indicated a drought condition in the study area. Similarly, the SPI
   results of all return periods have shown a significant drought condition
   in the Himalayas followed by-in terms of frequency and
   magnitude-Karakoram and Hindukush, respectively. Based on the above
   findings, it is recommended that the agriculture experts should work on
   drought-resilient crops in order to cope up with the harsh prevalent
   climatic condition in Northern Pakistan.},

Abstract = {Understanding the trend of chemical composition of precipitation is of
   great importance for air pollution control strategies in Northern China.
   A comprehensive study on the long-term chemical compositions of
   precipitation was carried out from 2003 to 2014 at the Shangdianzi (SDZ)
   regional background station in northern China. All samples were analyzed
   for pH, electrical conductivity and major ions (F-, Cl-, NO3-,SO42-,
   NH4+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+ and Na+). The average pH during this period was
   4.53 +/- 0.35, which is considerably lower than those reported in other
   background stations in China (Linan, Waliguan and Longfengshan). Ca2+
   and NO3- were the dominant ions in precipitation, with concentrations
   (volume-weighted mean) of 212.99 mu eg L-1, 200.20 mu eq L-1,116.88 mu
   eq L-1 and 98.56 mu eg L-1, respectively. The ion concentrations at SDZ
   were much higher than those of other background stations and megacities
   in China. A significantly increasing trend was observed for NO3- (726\%
   year(-1)) and a decreasing trend was observed for SO42-/NO3-, suggesting
   that the precipitation of SDZ evolved from a sulfuric acid type to a
   mixed type dominated by both sulfuric and nitric acid. The source
   identification indicated that SO42-, NO3-, NH4 and F- were dominated by
   secondary sources, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Na+ mostly originated from natural
   sources, and K+ and Cl- probably associated with anthropogenic sources.
   Long-range transport of air masses could influence the acidity,
   electrical conductivity and ion concentrations of precipitation at SDZ.
   The higher acidity and ion concentrations mainly occurred in the
   southerly and westerly trajectory pathways and partially in northwest
   pathways. Anthropogenic pollutants and crustal sources along these
   pathways were significant contributors to the chemical composition of
   precipitation in SDZ. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Trend detection of hydrological variables is important in the
   understanding of flood risks in a river basin. Nonparametric technique
   was applied to the analysis of summer precipitation in Huaihe River
   Basin (HRB). Results shows that mean precipitation varies greatly with
   greater values occurring in July temporally, and that greater values
   occur in the southern and eastern HRB and smaller values in the western
   and northern HRB spatially. In June, four stations, Xuzhou, Bengbu,
   Baofeng and Xuchang, which are in the upper to the middle reaches of the
   HRB, exhibit a statistically significant increasing trend; two stations
   show significant decreasing trend and one station increasing trend in
   July, they are Juxian, Rizhao and Kaifeng respectively, these three
   stations are mostly in the northern HRB; no significant trend is
   detected in August. Xihua and Rizhao have statistically significant
   increasing trend and decreasing trend in summer precipitation
   respectively. The Hurst H values indicate that there could be a slight
   decreasing trend in Gaoyou, Xuyi, Bengbu and Shangqiu in summer
   precipitation. For the rest stations, the future tendency of summer
   precipitation would be consistent with those of the past years. A
   long-range dependence characteristic exists in precipitation means that
   summer precipitation will maintain a detected significant decreasing
   trend in Rizhao and increasing trend in Xihua in the near future.
   Considering the trend of summer precipitation, it can not conclusively
   say that the flood risks are predominantly caused by climate change in
   the HRB, for the precipitation demonstrates no significant increasing
   trend in the HRB. Therefore, a more detailed research on the climate
   change and human activities is needed to obtain a wider understanding of
   the flood risks.},

Abstract = {It has been widely recognised that climate changes have significant
   impacts on hydrological processes and may increase flood risk. In the
   past 20 years, a frequent occurrence of heavy floods across the Xiang
   River basin (XRB) was witnessed, a major tributary of the Yangtze River
   basin (YRB), China. This study quantified impacts of precipitation
   extremes on streamflow changes across the XRB at annual and seasonal
   scales using the Mann-Kendall trend test (MK) method and continuous
   wavelet transform (CWT). Besides, the cross-wavelet transform (XWT) and
   wavelet coherence (WTC) methods were employed to identify the
   correlations between extreme precipitation and streamflow. The results
   indicated no significant trends in annual rainfall and/or streamflow,
   while the increasing trends in the summer extreme rainfall and
   streamflow can be observed in the upper and middle XRB. Results by the
   XWT and WTC indicated highly similar patterns of signal changes at 1-4
   and 5-12 years from the 1980s to 2005, between extreme precipitation and
   streamflow in the upper and middle river basin. Nevertheless, the
   changes in extreme precipitation in the lower reaches do not always
   coincide with the extreme streamflow variations. The coherence between
   extreme precipitation and river flows gradually declines from the upper
   to the lower basin.},

Title = {Variations and Trends in 115 Years of Graded Daily Precipitation Records
   at Three Hydrometeorological Stations in Finland},

Abstract = {This study investigated the variability and trends in 115 years
   (1909-2023) of daily precipitation observed at three hydrometeorological
   stations in southern (Kaisaniemi), central (Kajaani), and northern
   (Sodankyl \& auml;) Finland. We also identified the most significant
   climate teleconnections influencing daily precipitation variability at
   these three stations during the period 1951-2023. The daily
   precipitation records were primarily classified into six grades,
   including very light (<= 1 mm), light (1-<= 5 mm), moderate (5-<= 10
   mm), heavy (10-<= 15 mm), very heavy (15-<= 20 mm), and extreme (>20
   mm). On average, the most intense daily precipitation was determined at
   the Kaisaniemi station in southern Finland. At this station, however,
   very light and light precipitation showed the lowest frequency, but
   other graded daily precipitation events were the most frequent. At all
   three stations, the intensity of very light precipitation significantly
   declined during the past 115 years, while its frequency increased. The
   highest rates of such decreases and increases in the intensity and
   frequency of very light daily precipitation were found at the Sodankyl
   \& auml; stations in northern Finland, respectively, but the lowest
   rates were at the Kaisaniemi station in the south. At the Kajaani
   station in central Finland, the intensity of light precipitation
   decreased, but very heavy precipitation intensified. At this station,
   however, the number of both moderate and heavy precipitation events
   increased over time. Finally, historical variations in both the
   intensity and frequency of graded daily precipitation events in Finland
   showed significant relationships with different climate teleconnections,
   particularly the Scandinavia (SCAND) and the North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) patterns.},

Abstract = {In the Vosges Mountains (NE of France), integrated plot-catchment
   studies have been carried out since 1985 in the Strengbach basin to
   study the influence of acid atmospheric inputs on surface water quality
   and element budgets. In this paper, available mid-term time series
   (1985-1991) have been considered to detect obvious trends, if any, in
   surface water chemistry and element budgets. Air quality data showed a
   slight decline for SO2, whereas NO2 slightly increased over the period,
   but these trends are not very significant. This is in agreement with
   increased N concentration (mainly as NH4+) and with the stability of
   SO42- in open field precipitation. Because of a significant decrease in
   rainfall amount over the period, only inputs of NH4+ increased
   significantly whereas H+ and SO42+ inputs declined. In spring and
   streamwaters, pH and dissolved Si concentration increased mainly as a
   result of a reduced Bow. Na+, K+, Cl- and HCO-3(-) concentrations
   remained stable whereas Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42+ concentrations declined
   significantly. Only NO3- concentration increased significantly in
   springwaters. The catchment budgets revealed significant losses of base
   cations, Si and SO42-. These losses decreased over the period. Nitrogen
   was retained in the ecosystem. However, a longer record is needed to
   determine whether or not changes in surface water chemistry have
   resulted from short-term flow reductions or long-term changes in
   input-output ion budgets. This is specially true with N because the
   decline in SO42- output was accompanied by N accumulation.},

Title = {Temporal trends in <SUP>18</SUP>O composition of precipitation in
   Germany: insights from time series modelling and trend analysis},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {29},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2668-2680},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Temporal and spatial variations of stable oxygen (O-18) and hydrogen
   (H-2) isotope measurements in precipitation act as important proxies for
   changing hydro-meteorological and regional and global climate patterns.
   Temporal trends in time series of the stable isotope composition in
   precipitation were rarely observed, and they are poorly understood.
   These might be a result of a lack of proper trend detection tools and
   effort for exploring trend processes. Here, we investigate temporal
   trends of O-18 in precipitation at 17 observation stations in Germany
   between 1978 and 2009. We test if significant trends in the isotope time
   series from different models can be observed. Mann-Kendall trend tests
   are applied on the isotope series, using general multiplicative seasonal
   autoregressive integrate moving average (ARIMA) models, which account
   for first and higher order serial correlations. Effects of temperature,
   precipitation, and geographic parameters on isotope trends are also
   investigated in the proposed models. To benchmark our proposed approach,
   the ARIMA results are compared with a trend-free pre-whitening
   procedure, the state of the art method for removing the first order
   autocorrelation in environmental trend studies. Moreover, we further
   explore whether higher order serial correlations in isotope series
   affects our trend results. Overall, three out of the 17 stations show
   significant changes when higher order autocorrelation are adjusted, and
   four show a significant trend when temperature and precipitation effects
   are considered. The significant trends in the isotope time series
   generally occur only at low elevation stations. Higher order
   autoregressive processes are shown to be important in the isotope time
   series analysis. Results suggest that the widely used trend analysis
   with only the first order autocorrelation adjustment may not adequately
   take account of the high order autocorrelated processes in the stable
   isotope series. The investigated time series analysis method including
   higher autocorrelation and external climate variable adjustments is
   shown to be a better alternative. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {52-60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A better understanding of hydrological changes associated with climate
   change can be achieved by analyzing the temporal trends in river
   discharge time series. We used the non-parametric Spearman's rho,
   Kendall's tau, Mann Kendall and Theil-Sen approaches to evaluate annual
   and monthly trends in river flow data from 12 stations located in the
   mountainous western regions of Iran over a 40-year period spanning the
   hydrological years 1969-1970 to 2008-2009. The Pearson correlation
   analysis was also applied to explore the relationships between
   precipitation and river flow series. Using a 5\% significance level, we
   found an evidence of downward trends in annual river discharge at
   Varayeneh, Omar-Abad, Saleh-Abad, Zehtaran and Bahadorbeig stations at
   the rates of 0.491, 1.00, 0.101, 0.044, and 0.020 m(3)/s per decade,
   respectively. These significant downward trends started in the
   hydrological years of 2005-2006, 2000-2001,2006-2007, 1995-1996 and
   1995-1996, respectively. The greatest numbers of stations with
   significant river discharge trends occur in October and November,
   accounting for seven and six stations respectively. Annual precipitation
   exhibited no strong directional trend, although the tendency was toward
   increasing annual precipitation. Monthly precipitation variability seems
   to be also increasing for most of the months but no overall trend
   pattern in monthly precipitation totals emerged. Correlation analyses
   indicated strong relationships between river discharge and precipitation
   at the annual scale and for most of the months. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Although the Sahel precipitation decreased during the 1970s, it has
   increased since the mid-1980s. This trend shift also occurred throughout
   the world with weaker signatures than in Sahel. The Sahel trend shift
   was remarkably similar to the trend shift of the difference in SSTs
   between Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere; that is, until the
   1980s the NH SST had decreased relative to the SH SST, whereas after the
   1980s this trend reversed. Concurrent with this shift were trend shifts
   in the NH-SH contrast in atmospheric temperature and humidity and in
   inter-hemispheric meridional winds around Sahel. It appears that the
   NH-SH SST contrast determines the long-term variation of precipitation
   over Sahel through the shift of inter-hemispheric atmospheric
   circulations. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Trend and time series analysis of concentrations of lead in wet
   precipitation at different rural and urban sampling sites in Austria,
   collected during intervals of 6 - 12 years (between 1984 and 1995) is

   Sweden and North sea and western Atlantic regions. Reductions in rural
   sites between 60 and 80 \% in 10 years and around 90 \% in 10 years in
   urban areas are found. This trend correlates with the reduction of lead
   emissions from combustion of gasoline. The seasonal deconvolution model
   of the data set reveals a typical seasonality with lead concentration
   peaks in summer and spring for the rural sites and winter peaks for
   urban sites. The average annual lead concentration in the rural region
   for 1995 was 1.25 mu g/l, in the urban region 2.25 mu g/l. (C) 1999

Abstract = {In order to understand the long-term trend of chemical composition of
   wet atmospheric precipitation, the precipitation samples were collected
   for the time period from 1986 to 2006 at Shenzhen City, China. All the
   rainwater samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity, Cl-, F-, SO42-,
   NO3-, NH4+, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentration. Average pH during
   1986-2006 was 5.02, which is considerably higher compared to those
   reported in many other cities of the typical acid precipitation regions
   around the world. A significantly increasing trend (r = 0.44 at 2\%
   level) was observed for NO3- and a decreasing trend for they together
   result in the overall decreasing trend (at <0.1\% significance level) of
   pH. The concentrations SO42-, NO3- and Ca2+ were high compared to some
   developed countries and areas, but low compared to some other Chinese
   cities and some developing countries. NH4+ was much lower in
   precipitation in Shenzhen than it was in some developed countries. We
   find significant correlations between dust-derived cations and acidic
   anions, such as Ca2+ and SO42-, Ca2+ and Cl-, Mg2+ and SO42-, Mg2+ and
   Cl-, Mg2+ and NO3-, K+ and Cl-, K+ and F-, indicating that acid
   pollutants might be absorbed on particulate substances and react with
   alkaline cations. Evidence is found that anthropogenic and crustal
   sources have made significant contributions to both acidification and
   neutralization of precipitation in Shenzhen. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Climate change has altered the frequency, intensity, and timing of mean
   and extreme precipitation. Extreme precipitation has caused tremendous
   socio-economic losses, and severe impacts on human life, livelihood, and
   ecosystems. In recent years, heavy rainfall events occurred during the
   boreal summer (June-to-August) frequently and sporadically over South
   Korea. Given that its severity, a call for an urgent investigation of
   summer extreme rainfall is needed. Although many previous studies have
   addressed daily extreme precipitation, hourly extreme rainfall still
   needs to be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this study, we
   investigated the trends, spatio-temporal variability, and long-term
   variations in mean and extreme precipitation over South Korea during the
   boreal summertime using daily and hourly observational data through
   various analysis methods. During the past 50 years (1973-2022), there
   has been a notable escalation in maximum hourly precipitation, although
   the boreal summer mean precipitation has increased only marginally.
   Regionally, an increase in mean and extreme rainfall occurred in the
   northern part of the central region and the southern coast of the Korean
   peninsula. Moreover, the increase in intensity and frequency of extreme
   precipitation as well as in dry day have contributed more to the total
   summer precipitation in recent years. Our findings provide scientific
   insights into the progression of extreme summer precipitation events in
   South Korea.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the assessment of biases from infilling missing
   precipitation data on the detection of long-term change using parametric
   and non-parametric statistical techniques. Long-term historical
   precipitation data available for almost 100 years at 53 rain gages in
   south Florida, USA, with gages having varying lengths of missing data
   are used for the study. Precipitation data with gaps and time series
   with spatial interpolated data are analyzed. Chronologically complete
   datasets are often used in climate variability studies by analyzing data
   in multiple temporal windows. The temporal windows selected in this work
   coincide with Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO) cool and warm
   phases that strongly influence precipitation extremes and
   characteristics in the study region. Selection of these windows has
   helped in evaluating the extremes derived based on infilled and unfilled
   data. The frequency of occurrence of precipitation extremes over a
   pre-specified threshold is also analyzed. Results indicate that infilled
   precipitation data introduce large biases in the statistical trends and
   over and under-estimate low and high extremes respectively. Evaluation
   of three extreme precipitation indices (i.e. Rx1 day, R25mm and R50mm)
   indicates that bias increases with increase in amount of missing data.
   Nonparametric hypothesis tests indicate that statistical distributions
   of data of infilled and unfilled data are different when the data
   infilled is more than 5\% of the entire data. Infilled data also
   introduced high variability in precipitation extremes in AMO cool and
   warm phases along with the changes in the frequency of occurrence of
   extreme events over a threshold. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Investigations of climate change impacts on urban drainage system have

   attention in the coming future. This paper presents an approach to
   assessing the possibility of extreme rainfall events under variation
   greenhouse gas emission scenarios as well as a case study in Hefei City,
   China. Future precipitation projections were downscaled in a
   spatiotemporal way firstly, and summarised into
   intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves. The changes of the IDF were
   then compared subsequently between the present condition and the future
   scenarios. The results indicate that the local rainfall regime will
   generally stay the same or slightly increase for the drizzles, but the
   extreme events will become more intensive and frequent. Although
   uncertainty has been found among the different emission scenarios and
   the various future periods, it is still notable to take climate change
   into consideration to deal urban drainage system issues.},

Title = {An increasing trend in daily monsoon precipitation extreme indices over

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {This study assessed spatiotemporal trends in daily monsoon precipitation
   extremes at seasonal and sub-seasonal scales (June, July, August, and
   September) and their links with atmospheric circulations over Pakistan.
   The study used observed precipitation data from fifty in-situ stations
   and reanalysis products from the European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction/the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR)
   during 1981-2018. A suite of seven extreme precipitation indices and
   non-parametric statistical techniques were used to infer trends in the
   frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation indices. An increase in
   frequency and intensity of overall extreme indices was evident, with a
   maximum tendency in the country's northwestern (z-score=>2.5), central,
   and eastern (z-score > 4) monsoon-dominant parts. The northern and
   southwestern parts of the country exhibited a slight decrease (z-score
   <-2) in frequency and intensity. The Sen's Slope estimator (SSE) shows
   an increase in western parts (0.20 days) indicating a shift in the
   maxima of the monsoon precipitation. The regional precipitation shows an
   increase in wet days (R1 mm) with higher values of mMK (3.71) and SSE
   (0.3) in region 2 Similar results of moderate regional increase are
   evident for extreme indices except regions 1 and 3. The extreme 1-day
   maximum precipitation increased in region 3 (mMK: 1.39, SSE: 2.32). The
   extremely wet days (R99p TOT) precipitation has a moderate increase in
   all regions with a decrease in region 1. The temporal mutations showed
   dynamic changes, clearly reflecting the country's historical extreme
   events. The frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes negatively
   correlated with the altitude (R = -0.00039). The probability density
   function (PDF) showed a significant increase in the density during June
   and September with a probabilistic positive shift during July and
   August. The intensified mid-latitude westerlies and subtropical zonal
   easterlies teleconnections, strengthening of the monsoon trough, and
   land-ocean thermal contrast are the potential drivers of the increasing
   trend in precipitation extremes. The current study could serve as a
   benchmark for future researchers and policymakers to devise effective
   mitigation strategies for sustainable development.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of droughts is a permanent concern in arid and semi-arid
   zones, especially for socially vulnerable ones such as the Mixteca
   Region in Mexico, a condition that can be aggravated as climate change
   scenarios predicts. The general circulation models do not allow
   forecasting precipitation conditions at regional scales, so it is
   necessary to study local climate behavior and trends. Determining the
   relationship between local climate and large-scale phenomena, such as El
   Nino / La Nina events, is relevant to set up prevention measures. This
   article analyzes the precipitation trends in the Mixteca Region of
   Mexico, determines the presence of a statistically significant trend in
   observed decrease in precipitation, and analyzes the relationship
   between precipitation conditions in the zone and the Ocean Nino Index.
   It is shown that there is a statistically significant trend of
   decreasing precipitation, and it is found that there is a correlation
   between the El Nino Oceanic Index and the conditions of extreme
   precipitation-humidity or drought-in the region.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the precipitation extremes recorded on the
   northern and southern slopes of the central Himalaya, especially those
   documented at higher altitudes. Daily precipitation data recorded over a
   35-year period at nine meteorological stations in the region were
   studied. We used the precipitation extreme indices delineated by the
   Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The
   spatial and temporal variations in these precipitation extremes were
   calculated. When regional patterns were investigated to detect any
   anomalies, only 1 of the 10 precipitation extreme indices from the
   southern slopes of the central Himalaya showed a statistically
   significant trend; none from the northern slopes of the central Himalaya
   highlighted a statistically significant trend. On the southern slopes,
   all indices increased, apart from the maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1)
   and simple daily precipitation intensity (SDII) indices. Indices such as
   the consecutive dry days (CDDs) and RX1 indices exhibited similar

   Himalaya. These results suggest that increases in precipitation have
   been accompanied by an increasing frequency of extremes over the
   southern central Himalaya. Nonetheless, no relation could be established
   between the precipitation extreme indices and circulation indices for
   higher altitudes.},

Abstract = {Precipitation samples collected during 2005-2009 from a rural forest
   station of Bhubaneswar were analyzed for their chemical composition. The
   samples were collected through a wet-only (WO) collector and two bulk
   (B1 and B2) collectors. The ions were evenly balanced indicating good
   data quality. The overall pH of rainwater was slightly acidic and
   similar to 47\% of all rain events during the period were acidic (pH <
   5.6). Multilinear regression analysis showed relation between the free
   acidity (H+) and other components in rainwater. Enrichment factors (EF)
   of the major components with respect to their sources such as marine and
   crustal were calculated. Maximum EF was observed for NO (3) (-) for both
   marine and crustal sources for all the three collectors. Source
   apportionments were also carried for the ions. Trend analysis showed
   continuous increase in most of the ions over years during the study
   period driven by anthropogenic emissions. Statistical/factorial analysis
   established correlation among different ions.},

Abstract = {Precipitation changes in annual and seasonal time series over the Alborz
   Mountains area during 1950-2014 were analyzed using historical
   observations from 154 rain gauge stations. The projected changes in
   precipitation for the twenty-first century were evaluated using three
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) datasets. Trends
   in the precipitation time series were detected by linear regression and
   its significance was tested by t test. Mann-Kendall rank test (MK test)
   and Sen's slope estimator were also employed to confirm the results.
   Sequential Mann-Kendall test (SQ-MK test) was also applied for change
   point detection in annual and seasonal precipitation time series.
   Pre-whitening was used to eliminate the influence of serial correlation
   on the MK test. Future precipitation was analyzed by GFDL-CM3,
   HadGEM2-AO and MPI-ESM-MR models under two representative concentration
   pathways (RCP) RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The analysis of the
   historical precipitation series indicated an insignificant trend in the
   annual and seasonal series at most stations. The highest numbers of
   stations with negative significant trends occurred in winter and with
   positive significant trends in summer. The results of change point
   detection in annual and seasonal precipitation series show that most of
   the significant mutation points began in the 1970s. The future
   projections showed that precipitation may decrease according to most of
   the models under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, while the decrease
   may not be large, except in the summer season for the end of this
   century.},

Abstract = {Southeastern South America is subject to considerable precipitation
   variability on seasonal to decadal timescales and has undergone very
   heavy land-cover changes (LCCs) since the middle of the past century.
   The influence of local LCC and precipitation as drivers of regional
   evapotranspiration (ET) long-term trends and variability remains largely
   unknown in the region. Here, ensembles of stand-alone dynamic global
   vegetation models (DGVMs) with different atmospheric forcings are used
   to disentangle the influence of those two drivers on austral summer ET
   from 1950 to 2010. This paper examines the influence of both the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the dipole-like first-mode of
   southeastern South American precipitation variability (EOF1) on regional
   ET. We found that in the lower La Plata Basin, ET was driven by
   precipitation variability and showed a positive summer trend. Moreover,
   the region showed marked seasonal anomalies during El Nino and La Nina
   summers but mainly during EOF1 phases. On the contrary, in the upper La
   Plata Basin, LCCs forced the negative summer ET trend and particularly
   reduced the summer anomalies of the late 1990s, a period of ENSO and
   EOF1-positive phases. In the South Atlantic Convergence Zone region, the
   high ET uncertainty across ensemble members impeded finding robust
   results, which highlights the importance of using multiple DGVMs and
   atmospheric forcings instead of relying on single model/forcing results.},

Abstract = {The climatic characteristics of the precipitation in Guangdong province
   over the past 50 years were analyzed based on the daily rainfall
   datasets of 86 stations from 1961 to 2010. The rainfall was divided into
   five categories according to its intensity, and their spatiotemporal
   characteristics and variation trends were investigated. The annual
   rainfall amount was within 1,500 to 2,000 mm over most parts of
   Guangdong, but substantial differences of rainfall amount and rainy days
   were found among different parts of the province. There were many rainy
   days in the dry seasons (October to March), but the daily rainfall
   amounts are small. The rainy seasons (April to September) have not only
   many rainy days but also heavy daily rainfall amounts. The spatial
   distributions of light rainy days (1 mm 100 mm) are generally
   concentrated in three regions, Qingyuan, Yangjiang, and Haifeng/Lufeng.
   The average rainfall amount for rainy days increases form the north to
   the south of Guangdong, while decreasing as the rainfall intensity
   increases. The contributions from light, moderate and heavy rain to the
   total rainfall decreases form the north to the south. The annual rainy
   days show a decreasing trend in the past 50 years. The light rainy days
   decreased significantly while the heavy, rainstorm and downpour rainy
   days increased slightly. The annual total rainfall amount increased over
   the past 50 years, which was contributed by heavy, rainstorm and
   downpour rains, while the contribution from light and moderate rains
   decreased.},

Abstract = {Series of annual, monthly and seasonal precipitation from 50 stations,
   distributed all over the Basilicata territory (southern Italy), were
   studied for the period 1923-2000. All the series were checked for
   homogeneity using MASH v. 1.0.1 software and the time series analysis
   was performed with the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test in order to
   detect possible trends. The results show that the annual total rainfall
   decreased by about 156 mm during the period investigated; the decrease
   becomes stronger in the last 30 years. There are considerably different
   trends for the different seasons. In particular, only the winter trend,
   which is downward, is statistically significant. In this season the
   total rainfall has decreased by about 133 mm. For this same period the
   standardized precipitation index (SPI) for multiple time scales of 12,
   24 and 48 months has been computed. It appears that periods of drought
   have been quite frequent starting from 1975, with SPI ranging from about
   -1 to about -3. Copyright (C) 2004 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Title = {Extreme Precipitation in the Great Lakes Region: Trend Estimation and
   Relation With Large-Scale Circulation and Humidity},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {DEC 24},
Abstract = {Extreme precipitation contributes to widespread impacts in the U.S.
   Great Lakes region, ranging from agricultural losses to urban floods and
   associated infrastructure costs. Previous studies have reported
   historical increases in the frequency of extreme precipitation in the
   region and downscaled model projections indicate further changes as the
   climate system continues to warm. Here, we conduct trend analysis on the
   5 km NOAA NClimDiv data for the U.S. Great Lakes region using both
   parametric (Ordinary Least Squares) and non-parametric methods
   (Theil-Sen/Mann-Kendall) and accounting for temporal autocorrelation and
   field significance to produce robust estimates of extreme precipitation
   frequency trends in the region. The approaches provide similar overall
   results and reflect an increase in extreme precipitation frequency in
   parts of the U.S. Great Lakes region. To relate the identified trends to
   large scale drivers, a bivariate self-organizing map (SOM) is
   constructed using standardized values of 500 hPa geo-potential height
   and 850 hPa specific humidity obtained from the ECMWF ERA-5 reanalysis.
   Using a Monte Carlo approach, we identify six SOM nodes that account for
   only 25.4\% of all days, but 50.5\% of extreme precipitation days.
   Composites of days with and without extreme precipitation for each node
   indicate that extreme events are associated with stronger features
   (height gradient and background humidity) than their non-extreme
   counterparts. The analysis also identifies a significant increase in the
   frequency of one SOM node often associated with extreme precipitation
   (accounting for 8.5\% of all extreme precipitation days) and a
   significant increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation days
   relative to all days across the six extreme precipitation nodes
   collectively. Our results suggest that changes in atmospheric
   circulation and related moisture transport and convergence are major
   contributors to changes in extreme precipitation in the U.S. Great Lakes
   region.},

Title = {``North drying and south wetting{''} summer precipitation trend over
   China and its potential linkage with aerosol loading},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {125},
Pages = {12-19},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Changes in summer precipitation over China and their linkage to aerosol
   loading during 1957-2008 were analyzed. Increased (decreased) summer
   precipitation has been observed over the Southern (Northern) China,
   presenting a ``north drying and south wetting{''} pattern. Such a change
   in precipitation pattern is related to the decreased summertime
   temperature over South-central China (cool zone). The cool zone, in
   turn, is likely caused by the increased aerosol loading, as manifested
   by the increased Aerosol optical depth (ADD) over this region. The
   cooling effect in the cool zone together with steady warming over
   adjacent oceans (the South China Sea and the Western North Pacific)
   weaken land-sea temperature contrast, and thus the East Asia summer
   monsoon (EASM) circulation. The weakened EASM might restrain the
   rainbelt in southern China longer with less moisture penetrating further
   north in summer season. Our analysis suggests that the aerosol loading
   induced ``cool zone{''} could contribute to the ``north drying with
   south wetting{''} pattern over Eastern China by altering the intensity
   of EASM. Furthermore, this change in precipitation pattern is also
   reflected in the trend of Palmer Drought Severity Index in Eastern
   China, which indicates a more extensive tendency of dryness in Eastern
   China by considering both precipitation and temperature. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Components in precipitation are dominantly depended on structure and
   quantity of emissions on the course of the rainy air masses. It can be
   proved after meso- and long-range transport. Starting in 1982,
   precipitation is collected in 4-hour-periods at sites far from industry
   in East-Germany. For regions with specific geographical or uniform
   emission features arrival sectors are established, e. g. former GDR,
   Scandinavia, Poland, or Czech. The classiffication of the samples is
   done by back-trajectories.
   From the former GDR the anthropogenical components were most
   significantly raised before the political change, but acidity remained
   on an average level. After the change, the most emission products
   decline considerably - except NOx Consequently, those lead to essential
   changes of pollutants in precipitation. The reduction is not uniformly.
   The report represents long-term data and discusses clear differences
   between components in deposition from sectors of the former GDR and
   West-Germany. The effects of atmospheric rehabilitation are analysed.
   Specially starting in 1993 the acidity of rain from the former GDR
   increases very strikingly up to now threefold more than from
   West-Germany (average less than or equal to pH 4 at some sites). An
   explanation in terms of emission components only is devious, a complex
   consideration of change of dust composition as neutralizing factors and
   of processes of cloud formation and dispersal is necessary. It must be
   mentioned, that the acidity of precipitation from West-Germany and
   Scandinavia declines slightly in recent period. Therefore only
   sector-classified data show the real range of acidity.},

Abstract = {In this study, the trend of precipitation and river flow rate changes in
   Lake Urmia basin (LUB) were investigated at two monthly and annual
   scales using the modified Mann-Kendall test (MMK) with complete removal
   of autocorrelation process. To this purpose, 42 rain gauge and 25
   hydrometric stations were selected in Lake Urmia basin during the
   statistical period of 1984-2013. The results of studying the
   precipitation changes in the LUB indicated that this basin experienced a
   combination of decreasing and increasing trend during the studied
   statistical period. The decreasing precipitation trend was often
   observed at west and southwest stations of the basin. The increasing
   trend was observed in the southern and northeastern regions. The results
   of studying the changes in river flow rate of the studied stations in
   the LUB indicated that the trend of river flow rate is decreasing in
   most of the months. At an annual scale, the decreasing trend of river
   flow rate was also clearly observed across the basin at all stations. In
   addition, the decreasing trend of river flow rate is more severe in
   autumn and winter. The results of studying the time of changing point in
   the precipitation series showed that the time of changing point occurred
   between 1992 and 1998 at most of the stations that experienced a
   decreasing precipitation trend. The time of changing point of river flow
   rate in LUB occurred between 1994 and 1998. Two years after the
   reductions in precipitation, the decreasing trend of river flow rate
   occurred in the rivers.},

Abstract = {It is a known fact that the precipitation characteristics will become
   irregular as a result of climate change resulting from global warming.
   Trend analysis is one of the most effective methods of observing the
   effects of climate change on precipitation. This study compares the
   changes in precipitation with traditional trend analysis methods and
   graphical method (divided into subcategories using the Z-Score Index).
   Some preliminary analyzes (missing data estimation, homogeneity check,
   autocorrelation, and removal of the autocorrelation), which are lacking
   in many studies in the literature, have been performed. In this context,
   the monthly total precipitation data of the precipitation stations
   belonging to the Coruh Basin, one of the most important basins of
   Turkey, for the period 1972-2011 were used. As a result of the study, it
   was determined that all the stations' data were homogeneous, and 92\% of
   them were at the Class A level. While 100\% trend is determined in
   Innovative Trend Analysis in total annual precipitation, this rate was
   just 40\% at Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho at 95\% confidence. An
   increasing trend was determined in the ``high{''} group of total spring
   precipitation at all stations.},

Title = {Trend and extreme occurrence of precipitation in a mid-latitude Eurasian
   steppe watershed at various time scales},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {22},
Pages = {5547-5560},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {The confounding effects of step change invalidate the stationarity
   assumption of commonly used trend analysis methods such as the
   Mann-Kendall test technique, so previous studies have failed to explain
   inconsistencies between detected trends and observed large precipitation
   anomalies. The objectives of this study were to (1) formulate a trend
   analysis approach that considers nonstationarity due to step changes,
   (2) use this approach to detect trends and extreme occurrences of
   precipitation in a mid-latitude Eurasian steppe watershed in North
   China, and (3) examine how runoff responds to precipitation trends in
   the study watershed. Our results indicate that annual precipitation
   underwent a marginal step jump around 1995. The significant annual
   downward trend after 1994 was primarily due to a decrease in summer
   rainfall; other seasons exhibited no significant precipitation trends.
   At a monthly scale, July rainfall after 1994 exhibited a significant
   downward trend, whereas precipitation in other months had no trend. The
   percentage of wet days also underwent a step jump around 1994 following
   a significant decreasing trend, although the precipitation intensity
   exhibited neither a step change nor any significant trend. However, both
   low-frequency and high-frequency precipitation events in the study
   watershed occurred more often after than before 1994; probably as either
   a result or an indicator of climate change. In response to these
   precipitation changes, the study watershed had distinctly different
   precipitation-runoff relationships for observed annual precipitations of
   less than 300 mm, between 300 and 400 mm, and greater than 400 mm.

Title = {Precipitation trends over the Korean peninsula: typhoon-induced changes
   and a typology for characterizing climate-related risk},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Typhoons originating in the west Pacific are major contributors to
   climate-related risk over the Korean peninsula. The current perspective
   regarding improved characterization of climatic risk and the projected
   increases in the intensity, frequency, duration, and power dissipation
   of typhoons during the 21st century in the western North Pacific region
   motivated a reappraisal of historical trends in precipitation. In this
   study, trends in the magnitude and frequency of seasonal precipitation
   in the five major river basins in Korea are analyzed on the basis of a
   separation analysis, with recognition of moisture sources (typhoon and
   non-typhoon). Over the 1966-2007 period, typhoons accounted for 21-26\%
   of seasonal precipitation, with the largest values in the Nakdong River
   Basin. Typhoon-related precipitation events have increased significantly
   over portions of Han, Nakdong, and Geum River Basins. Alongside broad
   patterns toward increases in the magnitude and frequency of
   precipitation, distinct patterns of trends in the upper and lower
   quartiles (corresponding to changes in extreme events) are evident. A
   trend typology-spatially resolved characterization of the combination of
   shifts in the upper and lower tails of the precipitation
   distribution-shows that a number of sub-basins have undergone
   significant changes in one or both of the tails of the precipitation
   distribution. This broader characterization of trends illuminates the
   relative role of causal climatic factors and an identification of `hot
   spots' likely to experience high exposure to typhoon-related climatic
   extremes in the future.},

Abstract = {Long-term variations of monthly average maximum and minimum temperature
   (TMAX and TMIN) and precipitation records in southern Brazil are
   investigated for the 1913-2006 period. These variations are carefully
   analyzed for seasonal and annual indices, taken as regional averages.
   For this purpose, the serial correlation and trend of the indices are
   investigated using the run and Mann-Kendall tests. The significant
   trends are obtained from linear least-square fits. The annual and
   seasonal TMIN indices show significant warming trends with magnitudes
   (1.7A degrees C per 100 years for annual index) comparable to those
   reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but lower
   than those found for the southern Brazil in another previous work.
   Regarding the two other variables, the indices show significant trends
   only for summer, being a cooling trend of 0.6A degrees C per 100 years
   for the TMAX and an increasing trend of 93 mm per 100 years over an
   average summer precipitation of 367 mm. Concerning the decadal analysis,
   the 1920s present the lowest annual, autumn, and spring TMIN and the
   1990s, the highest ones. The 1970s is the decade with the lowest summer
   TMAX, and the 1940s the decade with the highest one. The driest decade
   is the 1940s and the wettest, the 1980s.},

Abstract = {Emissions from agricultural activities, both crop and animal, are known
   to contain gaseous ammonia (NH3) which through chemical reaction in
   rainwater changes into ammonium ion (NH4+). Using wet deposition data of
   ammonium from several National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National
   Trends Network (NADP/NTN) and ambient levels of ammonium from Clean Air
   Status Trends Network (CAST Net) sites as well as calculated NH3
   emissions from North Carolina, and the Southeast and Midwest regions of
   the United States, trends in ammonium concentrations in precipitation
   were analyzed for the period of 1983-2004. The beginning of 1997
   coincides with the implementation of a swine population moratorium in
   the state of North Carolina. Results from the analysis in North Carolina
   indicate a lessening in the rate of increases in NH4+ concentration in
   precipitation since the moratorium went into effect. Sampson County, NC,
   saw stable NH4+ concentrations from 1983 to 1989, an average rise of
   9.5\% from 1989 to 1996, and an average increase of only 4\% from 1997
   to 2004. In addition, HYSPLIT back-trajectory model was used to
   determine that when ambient air in downwind sites arrived from the high
   NH3 emissions source region, ammonium concentrations in precipitation
   were enhanced. For the Southeast. United States domain, analysis shows
   that NH4+ concentrations generally increased with increasing NH3
   emissions from within the same region. Similar analysis has been
   performed over the Midwest United States and compared to the results
   from the Southeast United States. Emissions from the Midwest are
   attributed to larger animals, including hogs and cattle, whereas the
   Southeast has a higher percentage of emissions coming from smaller
   livestock, such as chickens. In addition, the states of the Midwest
   United States have a much more uniform spatial distribution of
   emissions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Chemical time trends for precipitation, throughfall, and soilwater
   (1986-1992), and groundwater (1980-1993) at Birkenes, southern Norway,
   are compared to gain insights into possible causes for the recent
   increase in groundwater acidification there. Precipitation and
   throughfall trends do not show evidence for an increase in anthropogenic
   acids (e.g. sulphate), but seasalt deposition (e.g. chloride) has been
   marginally greater in 1990-1992 than in most previous years on record.
   Soilwater composition partly indicates increasing acidification in
   recent years (pH, Al and ANC), but hardness and sulphate content are
   decreasing. Soilwater ANC became negative in 1989, revealing a lasting
   deficit in its potential to buffer acidity. Groundwater shows clear
   signs of intensifying acidification (pH, Al, ANC, hardness and
   sulphate), and this may result partly from climatic conditions (mild
   winters, `seasalt episodes') and partly from the deterioration of an
   acid buffering system within the soil cover. Acidification via sulphate
   deposition certainly is not a direct cause. The declining hardness of
   soilwater suggests that the ion-exchange buffer in the soil may have
   ceased to function properly. The necessity for obtaining long-term
   time-series of water chemistry is underscored by this study.},

Title = {Contribution of internal variability to the Mongolian Plateau summer
   precipitation trends in MPI-ESM large-ensemble model},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {240},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Summer precipitation over the Mongolian Plateau (MP) has experienced a
   consistent decline in recent decades. While the influence of atmospheric
   wave train on this reduction in precipitation has been recognized in
   prior studies, this study delves deeper into the physical mechanisms and
   quantifies the contributions of the internal atmosphere and oceanic
   variations to the diminishing precipitation utilizing a comprehensive
   100-member ensemble simulations from the Max Planck Institute Earth
   System Model (MPI-ESM). Results show that the ensemble-mean
   precipitation in MP exhibits a positive trend and cannot explain the
   observed results. The precipitation trends vary significantly among
   individual ensemble members, highlighting the pivotal role of internal
   variability. The leading EOF mode of precipitation trends among ensemble
   members exhibits uniform variations. Further investigations reveal that
   the internal summer precipitation in MP is affected by the internal
   atmospheric circulation, the remote influence of the North Atlantic
   Dipole sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation-like SST patterns. An eastward-propagating Rossby wave
   originating from the North Atlantic dipole SST anomalies provides the
   anomalous large-scale circulation that influences summer precipitation.
   The PDO contributes to reinforcing the anticyclonic anomaly over the MP.
   Additionally, the uncertainty of precipitation trends in MPI-ESM can be
   reduced by 13\% through removing the internal atmospheric wave train-
   related precipitation variation, while oceanic factors only contribute
   about 7\% uncertainty of precipitation variations. Our insights enhance
   the understanding of the physical drivers behind summer precipitation
   variability in the MP and effectively quantify the uncertainties
   stemming from internal variability.},

Abstract = {Irregular precipitation regimes have important effects on the increase
   in the incidence and severity of meteorological disasters, the use of
   water resources, the decrease in the variety and amount of agricultural
   products, and on biodiversity. Therefore, investigating the temporal and
   spatial variations of precipitation is vital important in the future
   planning and management both water resources and of agricultural
   activities. In this study, it is aimed to investigate annual and
   seasonal time scales the spatial variability and temporal trends of
   concentration, seasonality and aggressiveness of precipitation in Seyhan
   Basin (Turkey), which has different topography and climate
   characteristics. For this purpose, nonparametric indices such as the
   Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI), Seasonality Index (SI) and
   Modified Fournier Index (MFI) were used. To calculate these indices,
   monthly precipitation data of 7 stations for the period 1970-2019 were
   used. While monotonic trends in the PCI, SI and MFI series were analyzed
   using the classical Mann-Kendall test, sub-trends were examined using
   Onyutha's test, which is an innovative method. The presence of monotonic
   and sub-trends was evaluated at the 5\% significance level. Analyses
   performed on both annual and seasonal scales showed that generally
   higher index values were obtained at stations in the south of the basin
   and lower indices values were obtained in other parts of the basin. The
   results of MK and Onyutha trend tests applied to annual total
   precipitation and PCI, SI and MFI values are similar. In general,
   insignificant positive trends were determined in the annual total
   precipitation and index values at the stations in the south of the
   basin, while insignificant negative trends were determined in the other
   regions.},

Abstract = {The length of historical records is important for analyzing trends and
   multidecadal variabilities in precipitation. Conventional studies
   usually used historical precipitation data less than 60 years, which may
   cause inaccurate precipitation predictions. To better understand the
   effects of the study period on precipitation trends and cycles, the
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope test were applied to analyze the trend
   and wavelet, while the multi-temporal analysis was used to study the
   cycles of long historical precipitation data at four rain gauge stations
   in Shandong Province, China. The analysis results using long-term
   records show an insignificant upward trend and a longer cycle in the
   annual precipitation, whereas a downward trend is found when using
   short-term records. Furthermore, it is found that selecting the length
   of the representative cycle derived from the precipitation data series
   as the time scale for the study proved to be more reasonable. A thorough
   consideration of the impact of cycles on trends should, therefore, be
   taken to facilitate a more accurate precipitation trend analysis.},

   in Finland during 1961-2011. Also, the connections between these high
   resolution (10 km) precipitation indices and six influential atmospheric
   circulation patterns (ACPs) for climate variability in Finland were
   studied. On the country scale, the results suggest significant increases
   in the amount and intensity of precipitation extremes, more
   precipitation days, and no clear changes in wet and dry spells. Both
   intensity and frequency of precipitation extremes over Finland decrease
   from south and southwest to north. The only exception is the
   distribution of precipitations days which is generally more frequent
   over eastern and upper areas of northern Finland. Wet (dry) spells were
   typically longer in the western (eastern) part of Finland. Significant
   increases in annual total wet-day precipitation, very wet days
   precipitation and simple daily intensity index were found over most
   parts of Finland during 1961-2011. Increasing trends in both extremely
   wet days and maximum 1-day precipitation were mostly observed in
   western, eastern, central and northern Finland. Such spatial pattern was
   also identified for significant increases in the frequency of heavy and
   very heavy precipitation days. The precipitation days increased over
   small parts of western, eastern and northern Finland. Wet spells showed
   lengthening trends in several grids over southwestern Finland, while dry
   spells lengthened in some areas over the entire country except southern
   parts. These variations in precipitation statistics were found to be
   significantly correlated with the East Atlantic/West Russia, East
   Atlantic, Scandinavia and Polar patterns.},

Abstract = {The long-distance effect of atmospheric pollution on ecosystems has led
   to the conclusion of international agreements to regulate atmospheric
   emissions and monitor their impact. This study investigated variations
   in atmospheric deposition chemistry in France using data gathered from
   three different monitoring networks (37 stations) over the period from
   1995 to 2007. Despite some methodological differences (e.g. type of
   collector, frequency of sampling and analysis), converging results were
   found in spatial variations, seasonal patterns and temporal trends. With
   regard to spatial variations, the mean annual pH in particular ranged
   from 4.9 in the north-east to 5.8 in the south-east. This gradient was
   related to the concentration of NOT and non-sea-salt SO42- (maximum
   volume-weighted mean of 38 and 31 mu eq l(-1) respectively) and of
   acid-neutralising compounds such as non-sea-salt Ca2+ and NH4+. In terms
   of seasonal variations, winter and autumn pH were linked to lower
   acidity neutralisation than during the warm season. The temporal trends
   in atmospheric deposition varied depending on the chemical species and
   site location. The most significant and widespread trend was the
   decrease in non-sea-salt SO42- concentrations (significant at 65\% of
   the stations). At the same time, many stations showed an increasing
   trend in annual pH (+0.3 on average for 16 stations). These two trends
   are probably due to the reduction in SO2 emissions that has been imposed
   in Europe since the 1980s. Temporal trends in inorganic N concentrations
   were rather moderate and not consistent with the trends reported in
   emission estimates. Despite the reduction in NOx emissions, NO3-
   concentrations in atmospheric deposition remained mostly unchanged or
   even increased at three stations (+0.43 mu eg l(-1) yr(-1) on average).
   In contrast NH4+ concentrations in atmospheric deposition decreased at
   several stations located in western and northern areas, while the
   estimates of NH3 emissions remained fairly stable. The decrease in
   non-sea-salt SO42- and NH4+ concentrations was mainly due to a decrease
   in summer values and can in part be related to a dilution process since
   the precipitation amount showed an increasing trend during the summer.
   Furthermore, increasing trends in NO3- concentrations in the spring and,
   to a lesser extent, in NH4+ concentrations suggested that other
   atmospheric physicochemical processes should also be taken into account.

Title = {Remote sensing for monitoring the impacts of agroforestry practices and
   precipitation changes in particle size export trends},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {Recent land use changes, the absence of soil protection between crop
   periods, and extreme precipitation events have been highlighted as major
   influential factors in the fluctuations of sediment export in the last
   decades at the catchment scale worldwide. In this regard, soil erosion
   and fine-particle export are two of the major concerns of soil nutrient
   loss and water-quality decrease (e.g., increasing turbidity and vector
   of chemicals). However, while rainfall effects have been well-monitored,
   recent land use changes and management need additional approaches to
   evaluate their effect. In Mediterranean mountainous environments, in
   addition to forest management, agricultural practices during different
   cropland stages likely increase sediment and particle-bound chemicals in
   the drainage system. Moreover, most catchments lack instrumentalization.
   Thus, there is a gap in the knowledge on the processes influencing the
   sediment exported in ungauged catchments. To evaluate the processes
   involved, remote sensing and seasonal sampling of suspended sediments
   were examined for 5 years in a representative agroforestry system in
   three sub-catchments (SBCs) with different proportions of land uses.
   Temporal trends of NDVI, EVI, MSAVI, SAVI, and NDWI indices were
   analyzed for monitoring the vegetation status. With this information, we
   attempt to evaluate the soil response in terms of particle size export
   to land use change, vegetation status, and precipitation distribution in
   fine-grained sediment-reaching streams. Our findings not only highlight
   the significant effect of heavy precipitation events and vegetation
   cover on the grain-size fraction of the exported sediment but also
   reveal the existence of more complex factors influencing the export
   dynamics. A silt-increasing trend due to the increase of individual
   heavy precipitations from 2017 onward despite the total precipitation
   amount not increasing was detected. It is shown that indices such as
   NDVI and NDMI help detect small changes in vegetation cover, while EVI,
   SAVI, and MSAVI are more robust for detecting general patterns in large
   vegetated areas and preventing the appearance of artefacts in the data.
   Results from this study suggest that land use changes combined with
   short-scale changing trends of rainfall likely explain most of the
   possible effects observed in terms of sediment export changes.},

Title = {ANALYSIS OF GLOBAL SOLAR RADIATION AND PRECIPITATION TRENDS IN
   CLUJ-NAPOCA, ROMANIA, OVER THE PERIOD 1921-2009},

Abstract = {The evolution of annual global solar radiation (GSR) and precipitation
   trends in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, was analyzed for the period 1921 to
   2009. In order to sustain the results from Cluj-Napoca, we had to add
   into analysis other two surroundings stations: Bistrita and Sibiu,
   because using only one meteorological station might be considered
   irrelevant. Also, we used into analysis the sunshine duration to make a
   good comparison with the evolution of global solar radiation. Four test
   methods have been performed on the data to test the series for
   homogeneity as follows: the Pettitt's test, the standard normal
   homogeneity test (SNHT) for a single break, the Buishand range test and
   the Von Neumann's ratio test. Different statistical procedures like
   regression models, Runs test and cumulative curve of the global solar
   radiation and precipitation standardized anomaly were used to find the
   most appropriate expression of the annual mean GSR and average amount of
   precipitation interannual evolution. The parametric analysis with
   regression models showed significant increasing trends for global solar
   radiation, sunshine duration and precipitation, the quadratic trend
   model providing a better fit than the linear and exponential models. To
   verify if the radiation, sunshine duration and precipitation variations
   were caused by trend or oscillation in the data, we used in the
   nonparametric analysis the Runs test. The results of Runs test detected
   significant trends for GSR and sunshine duration at Bistrita and Sibiu.
   Concerning to precipitation, the test didn't clearly detect any trend or
   oscillation at the three stations. The shape of the cumulative curve
   suggests that in the last two decades the general tendency is towards
   increasing annual global solar radiation at all three stations and the
   observed fluctuations represent a microcycle or microcycles (for
   example, Sibiu), as a result of the normal variations of the climate,
   which in the last few years is/are reacting to the solar variations. The
   decreasing tendency of the annual precipitation could be ascribed to
   solar activity, which is known that plays an important role in
   influencing the precipitation on land, and the consequence of this fact
   is that precipitation is closely related to the variation of sunspot
   numbers. Therefore, it is the most probably that this increasing in GSR
   and increasing/decreasing in precipitation represents the ascensional or
   descensional parts of some natural micro-oscillations due to solar
   activity/variations and natural climate variability.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess spatial and temporal changes in
   extreme precipitation events from 1983 to 2017 over different climatic
   regions of Nigeria. Ground observations of daily precipitation in 17
   meteorological stations scattered over the country were methodically
   analysed. Twelve widely used indices for the assessment of intensity
   (PRCPTOT, R x 5Days, SDII, R95p, R99p and R95pIndex) and frequency (CWD,
   CDD, R1mm, R10mm, R20mm and R25mm) of extreme precipitation were
   adopted. Linear trends were calculated using a least-square-fit
   approach, while significant trends were identified using the
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test. Results revealed general significant
   (at p < 0.05) downward annual trends in precipitation intensity indices
   {[}i.e. total wet day precipitation, (PRCPTOT), daily precipitation
   (SDII), 5-day maximum precipitation, (R x 5Days), very wet (R95p) and
   extremely wet days (R99p)], particularly in the Savannah and Sahel
   regions. The frequency indices {[}i.e. consecutive dry days (CDD), wet
   days (R1mm), heavy (R10mm), very heavy (R20mm) and extremely heavy
   precipitation (R25mm)] increased significantly in the Sahel but
   decreased in other zones. We established that R1mm decreases with
   decreasing SDII, while CWD declines with reducing SDII and R95p in the
   entire country. The study further revealed that Sahel and Savannah zones
   are highly vulnerable to severe droughts with potential negative
   implications on food security and water resources. It concluded that
   recent changes in climate had significantly impacted the extreme
   precipitation events within and across different climatic regions of
   Nigeria.},

Abstract = {Understanding the trend and variability in hydroclimatic extremes as
   well as drought characteristics in the context of changing climate is of
   paramount importance in the management of watershed and rain-fed farming
   systems. This study focuses on understanding the variations in rainfall
   patterns \& drought types with 3 regions of the agro-climatic zone, in
   the Mahi River basin, India. The basin is surrounded by three states
   i.e. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat which is known for its
   substantial drought occurrences. Very limited studies have been carried
   out using agroclimatic indices. A 50 years of daily rainfall data
   (gridded, 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees spatial resolution) from 1970 to
   2019 has been taken from India Meteorological Department (IMD) to
   compute extreme precipitation indices using ClimPACT2 package and time
   series trend was tested by Mann-Kendall. Further, 51 grid points are
   divided into three regions (region 1, region 2, and region 3) as per the
   agro-climatic zones over the Mahi River basin. The region-wise
   agroclimatic rainfall variability has been analyzed using monthly
   standard deviation and anomaly index. The run theory was applied for the
   characterization of drought assessment. Standardized precipitation index
   (SPI) was performed for 3, 6, 12, and 24-months. The result found a
   Consecutive dry day (CDD) with increasing trend significantly and
   Consecutive wet days (CWD) with decreasing trend may cause a possible
   impact on agriculture. Findings revealed that region 2 recorded
   consequent frequent and maximum droughts events over the basin. Hence,
   the regional topography and moisture availability perform a major role
   in regional precipitation variability. The output of the current study
   would be utilized in a better understanding of the drought condition and
   give a better climate change indication at a regional-basin level. This
   finding may be valuable for researchers to find out the crucial
   agro-climatic regions in the basin for preparedness for effective
   management and planning of water resources.},

Abstract = {In order to understand the actual status and mechanism of acid rain, it
   is important to know the pH of precipitation and its chemical
   constituents on a continuous and regular basis over a wide area. This
   study examines acid rain over a wide area using an observational network
   in the Tokyo metropolitan area of Japan, and analyzes the major chemical
   constituents of every precipitation sample. Precipitation was collected
   continuously for a period of 12 years from June 1990 to May 2002 at
   several sampling sites in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and its pH and
   chemical constituent concentrations were measured. The average pH ranged
   from 4.23 to 4.62, clearly indicating acidification of precipitation
   over the entire Tokyo metropolitan area. A time-trend model was applied
   to describe temporal variations of chemical constituent concentrations,
   including annual change rate, seasonal variation, and precipitation
   effects. Seasonal and annual trends for the past 12 years were examined
   with the model, using the least squares method. Nonsea salt (nss)-Ca2+
   shows a maximum value in early spring, a seasonality probably caused by
   calcium-rich particles in airborne yellow dust from Asia. Slightly
   decreasing annual trends of nss-SO42- may correspond to the recent
   decreasing trend of atmospheric SO2 gas concentrations in the Tokyo
   metropolitan area. The annual trends of NO3-, NH4+, and nss-Ca2+ show a
   large site-to-site difference. The increasing NO3-, NH4+, and nss-Ca2+
   concentrations at inland suburban sites may be caused by increases in
   their local sources such as vehicle traffic and municipal waste
   incineration. The annual change rate of H+ is slightly negative or
   almost zero at every site, so the acidification of precipitation has not
   become worse since 1990 over the Tokyo metropolitan area. (c) 2004

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to analyse the data structure of a
   large data set from rainwater samples collected during a long-term
   interval (1990-1997) by the Austrian Precipitation Monitoring Network.
   Eleven sampling sites from the network were chosen as data sources
   (chemical concentrations of major ions only) covering various location
   characteristics (height above sea level, rural and urban sampling
   positions, Alpine rim and Alpine valley disposition, etc.). The
   analytical results were treated by the application of already classical
   environmetric approaches, such as linear regression analysis,
   time-series analysis and principal components analysis (PCA). For most
   of the sampling sites, a distinct trend of acidity decrease of the wet
   precipitation was observed. An overall decrease in sulfate concentration
   for the whole period and all sites of 3.9\% year(-1) (2.0 mu equiv. L-1
   year(-1)) was found. The free acidity decrease for most of the sites was
   between 3.5 and 10.9\% year(-1). No significant linear trends were found
   for nitrate. Base cations either decreased (mean percentage decrease for
   calcium was 5.4\% year(-1) and for magnesium 4.4\% year(-1)) or did not
   show any significant change (sodium, potassium). The overall decrease in
   ammonium concentration was 2.3\% year(-1). Further, some typical
   ``rural{''} (summer minima and winter maxima) and ``urban{''} (winter
   minima and spring maxima) seasonal behaviour for the majority of the
   sites in consideration could be defined, indicating the influence of
   local emission sources. Several latent factors, named
   ``anthropogenic{''}, ``crustal{''} and ``mixed salt{''}, were revealed
   by the multivariate modelling procedure (PCA) possessing a similar
   structure for most of the sites. The unavoidable exceptions observed
   were indications of the influence of sporadic local events (construction
   and agricultural activities, secondary emission sources, etc.), and an
   effort was made to explain these exceptions.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis for the long-term average temperature and rainfall of
   Ethiopia during 1901 to 2015 has been performed to understand the
   pattern of these important meteorological features under climate change.
   The rainfall characterizations viz., precipitation concentration index
   (PCI), seasonality index (SI), rainfall anomaly index (RAI) and
   departure analysis of rainfall (DAR) have been calculated and
   interpreted. The annual rainfall recorded for the whole period was 816.3
   +/- 90.82 mm/year. During kiremt (long rainy) season, maximum seasonal
   rainfall of 453.2 mm were recorded while, its minimum value (39.6 mm)
   were received in bega (dry) season, respectively. The analysis of
   probability distribution for the time series data showed slightly
   positive skewness and kurtosis in monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall
   from the normal distribution. The results of Modified Mann-Kendall trend
   analysis for average temperature revealed a significant increasing trend
   from 1961 to 2015. Conversely, dry season (bega) rainfall, showed an
   increasing trend while kiremt season rainfall with decreasing trend for
   the period of 1901-2015. However, annual and other seasonal rainfall did
   not show any statistically significant trend. Study concludes that there
   is an increase in the average temperature in Ethiopia but, it
   constitutes a high degree of stability in rainfall rate and
   distribution.},

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, weather and climate extremes have become a
   major focus of researchers, the media and general public due to their
   damaging effects on human society and infrastructure. Trends in indices
   of climate extremes are studied for the South Asian region using
   high-quality records of daily temperature and precipitation
   observations. Data records from 210 (265) temperature (precipitation)
   observation stations are analysed over the period 1971-2000 (1961-2000).
   Spatial maps of station trends, time series of regional averages and
   frequency distribution analysis form the basis of this study. Due to the
   highly diverse geography of the South Asian region, the results are also
   described for some specific regions, such as the island of Sri Lanka;
   the tropical region (excluding Sri Lanka); the Greater Himalayas above
   35 degrees N, the Eastern Himalayas (Nepal) and the Thar Desert.
   Generally, changes in the frequency of temperature extremes over South
   Asia are what one would expect in a warming world; warm extremes have
   become more common and cold extremes less common. The warming influence
   is greater in the Eastern Himalayas compared with that in the Greater
   Himalayas. The Thar Desert also shows enhanced warming, but increases
   are mostly less than in the Eastern Himalayas. Changes in the indices of
   extreme precipitation are more mixed than those of temperature, with
   spatially coherent changes evident only at relatively small scales.
   Nevertheless, most extreme precipitation indices show increases in the
   South Asia average, consistent with globally averaged results. The
   indices trends are further studied in the context of Atmospheric Brown
   Clouds (ABCs) over the region. Countries falling within the ABC hotspot
   namely Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) have shown a different behaviour on the
   trends of extreme indices compared with the parts outside this hotspot.
   IGP has increased temperature and decreased rainfall and tally closely
   with the actual trends.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the trends in rainfall and temperature and the
   possibility of any rational relationship between the trends over the
   homogeneous regions over India. Annual maximum temperature shows an
   increasing trend in all the homogeneous temperature regions and
   corresponding annual rainfall also follow the same pattern in all the
   regions, except North East. As far as monthly analysis is concerned, no
   definite pattern has been observed between trends in maximum and minimum
   temperature and rainfall, except during October. Increasing trends of
   maximum and minimum temperature during October accelerate the water
   vapor demand and most of the lakes, rivers, ponds and other water bodies
   with no limitation of water availability during this time fulfills the
   water vapor demand and shows an increasing trend of rainfall activity.
   This study shows there exists no direct relationship between increasing
   rainfall and increasing maximum temperature when monthly or seasonal
   pattern is concerned over meteorological subdivisions of India, however
   we can make a conclusion that the relation between the trends of
   rainfall and temperature have large scale spatial and temporal
   dependence.},

Title = {Spatial distribution and interannual trends of δ<SUP>18</SUP>O,

Abstract = {NE Italy presents high-quantity, high-quality and easily exploitable
   groundwater resources that are seriously threatened by anthropogenic
   pressures. This study analyzes the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic
   composition of 2250 precipitation samples collected in 36 sites across
   the north-easternmost region of Italy, Friuli Venezia Giulia, between
   1984 and 2015. This is an unprecedented dataset for North Italy with a
   high density of sampling sites and a decadal temporal extension. A
   series of both routine and original chemometric approaches were applied
   to investigate the temporal and spatial variability of the isotopic
   composition through relationships with geographical and weather
   variables. New statistical approaches were presented to model the
   seasonal and spatial patterns of isotopic composition as well as to
   summarize the large amount of isotopic data. Significant gradients of
   delta O-18 and delta H-2 were detected in the area due to the peculiar
   orography and climate of the region; the amplitude of the monthly
   patterns also presented similar gradients. The deuterium excess did not
   present a clear seasonality, but higher values were found in autumn. The
   deuterium excess-to-delta O-18 ratio exhibited typical patterns
   throughout the region when grouping the sites for altitude and
   continentality; in winter, large differences of delta O-18 were detected
   among groups, but deuterium excess remained almost unchanged. The
   inter-site correlations were moderately high across all the territory
   even for deseasonalized data. The local meteoric water line (using all
   the single samples delta H-2 = 7.8.delta O-18 + 8.9) was also estimated
   at annual and seasonal basis, evidencing the presence of spatial
   gradients according to the orographic and weather characteristics of the
   region. Statistically significant increasing interannual trends
   (0.23-0.87 parts per thousand/y) were detected in 11 sites for deuterium
   excess; the presence of these trends was linked to local processes. Two
   multiple linear regression models were applied to reconstruct the
   isotopic composition of precipitation at a regional scale. The stepwise
   approach returned the best results with root mean square errors in the
   0.5-1 parts per thousand, 3.5-8.2 parts per thousand and 0.9-1.5 parts
   per thousand intervals for delta O-18, delta H-2, and deuterium excess,
   respectively. The deuterium excess was not modelled in winter, where no
   relationships were found with geographic variables.},

Title = {Long-term trends in daily precipitation over the Yangtze River Delta
   region during 1960-2012, Eastern China},

Abstract = {Based on daily precipitation data from 24 stations over the Yangtze
   River Delta (YRD) region, the long-term trends of daily precipitation
   are analyzed during the period 1960-2012 using 12 precipitation indices.
   The results indicate that the following. (1) For the regional average
   trends of precipitation, nine indices {[}i.e., RR, SDII, PCI(day),
   R25mm, R50mm, R25mmT, R50mmT, R25mmTOT, and R50mmTOT] show the
   increasing trends, while three indices {[}i.e., RX1day, RR1 and
   PCI(month)] display the decreasing trends. Furthermore, the annual total
   precipitation (RR) is correlated strongly with most of the other
   precipitation indices, especially indices represent the heavy
   precipitation which is responsible for more than 90 \% of the total
   increase of precipitation. (2) The central and southern parts of the
   study area become more humid than the northern parts, although the daily
   precipitation undergo a consistent concentrated trend over almost all of
   the study area. Moreover, the frequency and contribution of the heavy
   precipitation also arise dramatically in almost the entire study area,
   and the precipitation events show the significant trend of extremeness.
   (3) The abrupt changes for RR, RX1day, SDII, R50mm, R50mmT, and R50mmTOT
   are detected in 1984, 1988, 1987, 1984, 1988, and 1988, respectively,
   which indicate the abrupt change of precipitation occurred consistently
   in the mid-1980s. Three major cycles of precipitation detected are
   5-6-year cycle, 13-year cycle, and 20-year cycle, with a nonsignificant
   2-year cycle coexisted. In addition, a significant change of cycles
   occurred in the 1980s, when the short cycle was set to overtake the long
   cycle, resulting in high-frequency and instability of precipitation
   changes over the YRD region in recent decades. (4) There are three
   factors (the global warming, the East Asian summer monsoon change, and
   the urbanization development) might potentially impact on the frequency
   and volume of precipitation. The variation of East Asian summer monsoon
   is the key factor that influences the increase of precipitation, while
   the global warming and the urbanization development perform the
   background factor and the local factor, respectively.},

Title = {Using discrete wavelet transforms to analyze trends in streamflow and
   precipitation in Quebec and Ontario (1954-2008)},

Abstract = {This paper aims to detect trends in mean flow and total precipitation
   data over southern parts of Quebec and Ontario, Canada. The main purpose
   of the trend assessment is to find out what time scales are affecting
   the trends observed in the datasets used. In this study, a new trend
   detection method for hydrological studies is explored, which involves
   the use of wavelet transforms (WTs) in order to separate the rapidly and
   slowly changing events contained in a time series. More specifically,
   this study co-utilizes the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique
   and the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend tests to analyze and detect trends in
   monthly, seasonally-based, and annual data from eight flow stations and
   seven meteorological stations in southern Ontario and Quebec during
   1954-2008. The combination of the DWT and MK test in analyzing trends
   has not been extensively explored to date, especially in detecting
   trends in Canadian flow and precipitation time series. The mother
   wavelet type and the extension border used in the wavelet transform, as
   well as the number of decomposition levels, were determined based on two
   criteria. The first criterion is the mean relative error of the wavelet
   approximation series and the original time series. In addition, a new
   criterion is proposed and explored in this study, which is based on the
   relative error of the MK Z-values of the approximation component and the
   original time series. Sequential Mann-Kendall analysis on the different
   wavelet detail components (with their approximation component added)
   that result from the time series decomposition was also used and found
   to be helpful because it depicts how harmonious each of the detail
   components (plus approximation) is with respect to the original data.
   This study found that most of the trends are positive and started during
   the mid-1960s to early 1970s. The results from the wavelet analysis and
   Mann-Kendall tests on the different data types (using the 5\%
   significance level) reveal that in general, intra- and inter-annual
   events (up to 4 years) are more influential in affecting the observed
   trends. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {What induces the interdecadal shift of the dipole patterns of summer
   precipitation trends over the Tibetan Plateau?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) exert great impacts on the
   energy, water cycle, and regional ecosystem. But due to the wide
   differences in climate regimes and complicated topography, TP
   precipitation is characterized as greater spatial diversity and lower
   confidence of temporal tendency. Based on the precipitation datasets
   from in situ observations, reanalysis, and satellites, this study
   identifies the interdecadal shift of the summer precipitation trends in
   the southern and northern TP, which corresponds well with the remarkable
   changes of TP lakes area in recent years. The statistical results
   indicate that the TP summer precipitation has experienced an
   interdecadal transition in the late 1990s, with precipitation increasing
   and then decreasing in the southern TP, and decreasing and then
   increasing in the northern TP. Further analyses suggest that the changes
   in moisture budget and convection activities play an important role in
   the interdecadal variations of precipitation in the northern and
   southern TP, respectively. More specifically, the variations in the
   southern TP are contributed largely by the persistent weakening sensible
   heat source, which can depress the ascending motion and hinder the
   northward moisture transport in the southern TP. While in the northern
   TP, both observations and model sensitivity experiments indicate that
   the co-effect of the cold interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) and
   warm Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) has profound impacts on the
   decadal shift of the net moisture budget in the northern TP.
   Specifically, the AMO can impact the Lake Baikal anticyclone through the
   anomalous wave propagation and then decrease the moisture output in the
   eastern TP. While the IPO can weaken the climatological westerlies and
   prompt the moisture to get stuck in the northern TP. Consequently, the
   variations in the net moisture budget can give rise to the decadal
   variations in summer precipitation in the northern TP.},

Abstract = {This study compares the precipitation trend from the gridded rain gauge
   data collected by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and

   Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) version 7, Climate Prediction Center

   Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and
   Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) version 1.1 for the
   river basins of India. The IMD and HRPPs are of the same spatial
   resolution (0.25 x 0.25) and extend from 1998 to 2015. The gridded
   precipitation datasets are compared for 25 river basins of India. TRMM,
   CMORPH, PERSIANN, and MSWEP datasets accuracy for the river basins are
   assessed by comparison with IMD using root mean square error (RMSE) and
   correlation coefficient (CC) methods. The Mann Kendall (MK) and modified
   Mann Kendall (MMK) tests are applied for analyzing the data trend, and
   the change is detected by Sen's Slope using all datasets for annual and
   seasonal time periods. Variation in precipitation is high ( > 20\%) in
   the northern part of India in all datasets. All these basins located at
   the elevations above 2000 m. The annual and monsoon trend pattern for
   TMPA, CMORPH, PERSIANN, and MSWEP matched with IMD data in the north,
   northwest, and central part in 1-2, 22-25, and parts of 3, 12, and 21
   river basins (1998-2015). The calculated results implied that the TMPA
   precipitation product (in terms of accuracy) and PERSIANN (in terms of
   annual and monsoon trend) show a better agreement with IMD and they can
   be used in climate studies and hydrological simulation in
   locations/river basins where the number of rain gauges is not adequate
   to quantify the spatial variability of precipitation.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a serious issue resulting in global variation in the
   temperature and precipitation pattern. In this study, changes in
   rainfall trend in India for 141 years (1871-2011) and temperature trend
   for 107 years (1901-2007) were analysed. The annual, seasonal and
   monthly changes in different regions of India were investigated to see
   the climate change in different parts of the country, and the net excess
   or deficit of rainfall and temperature in India was obtained.
   Statistical non-parametric tests were performed to see the trend
   magnitude with the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope.
   Mann-Whitney-Pettitt (MWP) test was used for probable break point
   detection in the series, and change percentage was calculated over 30
   sub-divisions and 7 broad regions. The results indicate decreasing
   annual and monsoon rainfall of India in most of the sub-divisions, and
   temperature fluctuations were observed in all the places. Temperatures
   (minimum, maximum and mean) were showing a significant increase,
   particularly in the winter and post-monsoon time. Wide variation was
   noticed all over India in the case of the minimum temperature. Variation
   was also observed at different spatial scales of sub-divisions and
   regions. This study gives the net impact of climate change in India
   which shows net excess of temperature and net deficit of rainfall.},

Abstract = {Trends in extreme daily temperature and rainfall have been analysed from
   1961 to 2002 for the western Thailand (Mae Ping and Mae Klong river
   basins). Daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature data for
   15 stations were analysed to calculate 21 extreme indices. The magnitude
   of trends was estimated using the linear regression method while its
   statistical significance was evaluated using the p-value at 5\%
   significance level and Kendall-tau test. The result of the analysis
   depicts significant increase in the annual number of warm days and warm
   nights, with corresponding significant decreases in the annual number of
   cool days and cold nights. The warm spell duration indicator presents
   statistical rising trends. The trends for temperature indices are more
   consistent in the region compared to precipitation indices. There is
   insignificant decrease in annual total precipitation for nearly all
   stations. The maximum number of consecutive dry days (rain less than
   1mm) is increasing. The number of days with rainfall more than 10 and
   20mm has declined over both basins except at Kanchanaburi station.
   Analysis also reveals that there is less spatial coherent in other
   extreme indicators, namely, maximum 1-day and 5-days rainfall amount and
   simple daily intensity index.},

Abstract = {The present work aims to characterize trends in air temperature and
   precipitation from the late 1930s to 2007 in the Dominican Republic,
   establishing whether some climate change patterns can be identified in
   the distribution of climate types of this country. The time series to be
   analysed present many quality issues and challenges, essentially due to
   abundance of missing data and inhomogeneous measurements. A number of
   statistical corrections have hence been applied: time series have been
   first filtered, then homogenized with respect to purposely built
   reference series, then completed through multiple imputation. Trend
   estimation has finally been performed on the annual and monthly scale.
   The analysis of homogenized and imputed series shows that significant
   trends occurred since 1930s, both in rain and air temperature. A pattern
   in the distribution of rain trends is evident in the country during the
   period 1939-2007, which reflects the influence of the orographic
   structure of the country on the atmospheric dynamics that dominate in
   the Caribbean region: significant negative annual trends are detectable
   in leeward areas, behind the main mountainous chains, while positive
   trends are generally evident in windward regions, exposed to trade
   winds. All the analysed series demonstrate an increase in air
   temperature: in Santo Domingo, minimum air temperature increased 3.0 +/-
   0.5 degrees C since 1936, while the maximum air temperature increased
   1.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C in the same period. Furthermore, an increase of
   rain erosivity can be detected on the South coast of the country, in
   some areas of the Cordillera Central and in the Northeast. Another
   important result is the increase of potential evapotranspiration, while
   significant uniform trends cannot be identified for extreme events.},

Abstract = {This article presents a spatio-temporal analysis of the rainfall
   distribution for the State of Rond (o) over cap nia. Data from the
   Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission were analyzed, comprising a time
   series from 1998 to 2019. Data obtained from remote sensing were
   validated with data collected from rainfall stations. Trend analyzes
   were developed by applying the Mann-Kendall test. The spatialization of
   the increase and decrease of precipitation for the state was per-formed
   using the slope method of Sen. The rainfall stations showed a percentage
   of underesti-mation of-66\%, an average standard error of 156.8
   mm.year(- 1) an average correlation (r) of 0.66, indicating an average
   degree of agreement (d) equivalent to 0.68. The decrease in annual
   precipitation occurs mainly in the north of the state. For the dry
   season, protected areas again showed a smaller reduction than
   unprotected areas. Protected areas showed a reduction of 6 mm. year(-1)
   while unprotected areas showed a reduction of 8 mm.year(-1,) also in the
   north of the state. According to the TRMM data obtained from remote
   sensing, a reduction of approximately 1.5 mm.year(-1) can be seen,
   mainly in the northern region of the state of Rondo (o) over cap nia,
   which has extensive areas of conversion of native forest to pasture and
   an increase in approximately 1 mm. yea(-1) in the southwest region of
   the state, which has the largest extension of protected natural areas.},

Title = {Investigating Trends in Streamflow and Precipitation in Huangfuchuan
   Basin with Wavelet Analysis and the Mann-Kendall Test},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate trends in streamflow and precipitation in
   the period 1954-2010 in a semiarid region of the Yellow River watershed,
   Huangfuchuan basin, China. The combination of the wavelet transform and
   different Mann-Kendall (MK) tests were employed to figure out the basic
   trends structure in streamflow and precipitation and what time scales
   are affecting the observed trends. The comparative analysis with five MK
   test methods showed that the modified MK tests with full serial
   correlation structure performed better when significant autocorrelations
   exhibited for more than one lag. Three criteria were used to determine
   the optimal smooth mother wavelet, the decomposition level and the
   extension mode used in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) procedure.
   The first criteria referred to the relative error of the wavelet
   approximated component and the original series. The second one was the
   relative error of MK Z-values of approximation component and the
   original series. Additionally, a new criterion (Er), based on the
   relative error of energy between the approximate component and the
   original series, was proposed in this study, with better performance
   than the previous two criteria. Further, a new powerful index, the
   energy of the hydrological time series, was proposed to verify the
   dominant periodic components for the observed trends. The analysis
   indicated that all monthly, seasonal and annual streamflow showed
   significant decreasing trends, while no significant trends were found in
   precipitation. Results from the DWT and MK tests revealed that the main
   factors influencing the trends in the monthly and seasonal series in
   Huangfuchuan watershed are intra-annual cycles, while the leading
   factors affecting the trends in the annual series are decadal events.
   Different driving factors (e.g., seasonal cycles, solar activities,
   etc.) related to the periodicities identified in these data types
   resulted in this discrepancy.},

Title = {Detection probability of trends in rare events:: Theory and application
   to heavy precipitation in the Alpine region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1568-1584},
Abstract = {A statistical framework is presented for the assessment of
   climatological trends in the frequency of rare and extreme weather
   events. The methodology applies to long-term records of event counts and
   is based on the stochastic concept of binomial distributed counts. It
   embraces logistic regression for trend estimation and testing, and
   includes a quantification of the potential/limitation to discriminate a
   trend from the stochastic fluctuations in a record. This potential is
   expressed in terms of a detection probability, which is calculated from
   Monte Carlo-simulated surrogate records, and determined as a function of
   the record length, the magnitude of the trend and the average return
   period (i.e., the rarity) of events.
   Calculations of the detection probability for daily events reveal a
   strong sensitivity upon the rarity of events: in a 100-yr record of
   seasonal counts, a frequency change by a factor of 1.5 can be detected
   with a probability of 0.6 for events with an average return period of 30
   days; however, this value drops to 0.2 for events with a return period
   of 100 days. For moderately rare events the detection probability
   decreases rapidly with shorter record length, but it does not
   significantly increase with longer record length when very rare events
   are considered. The results demonstrate the difficulty to determine
   trends of very rare events, underpin the need for long period data for
   trend analyses, and point toward a careful interpretation of
   statistically nonsignificant trend results.
   The statistical method is applied to examine seasonal trends of heavy
   daily precipitation at 113 rain gauge stations in the Alpine region of
   Switzerland (1901-94). For intense events (return period: 30 days) a
   statistically significant frequency increase was found in winter and
   autumn for a high number of stations. For strong precipitation events
   (return period larger than 100 days), trends are mostly statistically
   nonsignificant, which does not necessarily imply the absence of a trend.},

Abstract = {Trends for the 21-year period 1973-1993 of temperatures at the surface
   and in the troposphere were analyzed from radiosonde observations in
   eight north-latitude regions. The seasonal consistency of the surface
   and tropospheric trends of temperature and evening-morning temperature
   difference was examined for these regions. In most seasons the surface
   temperature trends were positive in Eurasia and western N. America but
   were negative in central N. America and eastern Canada. The regions with
   sizable and statistically significant surface temperature trends usually
   had significant tropospheric trends up to 500 mb and sometimes to 300
   mb. An exception was central Asia, where the strong warming was confined
   below 850 mb. The significant tropospheric trends showed a tendency to
   de crease in magnitude with height. Trends of the evening minus morning
   temperature difference were also analyzed in two sectors, Canada and
   Russia, where the radiosonde launches occurred at 5am and pm +/-2hrs.
   Trends were fairly consistent in sign between the surface and lower
   troposphere in both sectors and up to 300 mb over Canada. Most Canadian
   trends were significant and represented a decreasing range between
   evening and morning temperatures. Significant Russian trends were
   primarily in summer.},

Abstract = {A global climatology of diurnal variations in sea-surface temperature
   based on in situ drifting-buoy data has been created. The diurnal
   warming signal derived from these data correlates well with estimates
   from a version of the Stuart-Menteth (2004) model, which parametrises
   the diurnal cycle based on incoming short-wave radiation, wind speed and
   time of day, that has been modified to accept monthly inputs. An
   estimate is also made of the bias in estimates of tropospheric
   temperature derived from the Microwave Sounding Unit instruments that is
   due to the drift in local equator crossing time of the satellite orbits.
   In the tropics, this contribution is approximately 13\% of the observed
   trend in tropospheric temperatures.},

Title = {Trend detection of annual precipitation of Karnataka, India during
   1951-2020 based on the innovative trend analysis method},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {82},

Abstract = {Water is a scarce resource on the earth, and the study of variability in
   precipitation is necessary for solving the issues related to water.
   Proper understanding of trends in annual precipitation is crucial for
   better management of available water sources. In the current study, the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) and innovative trend analysis (ITA) methods were used
   to detect the trends in annual rainfall for 30 synoptic stations and
   different meteorological subdivisions for the period of 1951-2020 for
   Karnataka, India. The significance of trend is also identified using the
   MK trend test. Furthermore, the entire time series data were classified
   into three sub groups to recognize the monotonic trend components based
   on the ITA method. The results of the MK trend test indicated that, in
   the first half of the time series data more stations showed decreasing
   trend, while in the second half, an increasing trend in annual
   precipitation was observed for most of the stations. In the ITA method,
   except for four stations, all the stations detected a significantly
   positive trend in annual precipitation. The spatially distributed trend
   for precipitation pattern for the total time series data showed the
   highest positive and negative trends in the southern and northern parts
   of the state, respectively. Six stations, namely, Bidar, Dakshina
   Kannada, Dharwad, Kalburgi, Udupi, and Vijayapura, exhibited instability
   in calculated trends. In the analysis of monotonic trends, only six
   stations showed monotonic trend components, while the other 24 stations
   and subdivisions are non-monotonic. In the current study, it was
   concluded that the ITA method is more sensitive than the MK trend test
   for detecting hidden trends.},

Title = {Historical Evolution and Future Trends of Precipitation Based on
   Integrated Datasets and Model Simulations of Arid Central Asia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Earth system models (ESMs) are important tools for assessing the
   historical characteristics and predicting the future characteristics of
   precipitation, yet the quantitative understanding of how these
   land-atmospheric coupling models perform in simulating precipitation
   characteristics remains limited. This study conducts a comprehensive
   evaluation of precipitation changes simulated by 43 ESMs in CMIP5 and 32
   ESMs in CMIP6 in Arid Central Asia (ALL) and its two sub-regions for
   1959-2005 with reference to Climate Research Unit (CRU) data, and
   predicts precipitation changes for 2054-2100. Our analyses suggest the
   following: (a) no single model consistently outperformed the others in
   all aspects of simulated precipitation variability (annual averages,
   long-term trends, and climatological monthly patterns); (b) the CMIP5
   and CMIP6 model simulations tended to overestimate average annual
   precipitation for most of the ALL region, especially in the Xinjiang
   Uygur Autonomous Region of China (XJ); (c) most model simulations
   projected a stronger increasing trend in average annual precipitation;
   (d) although all the model simulations reasonably captured the
   climatological monthly precipitation, there was an underestimation; (e)
   compared to CMIP5, most CMIP6 model simulations exhibited an enhanced
   capacity to simulate precipitation across all aspects, although
   discrepancies persisted in individual sub-regions; (f) it was confirmed
   that the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) provides a more accurate
   representation of the three aspects of precipitation compared to the
   majority of single-model simulations. Lastly, the values of
   precipitation predicted by the more efficient models across the ALL
   region and its sub-regions under the different scenarios showed an
   increasing trend in most seasons. Notably, the strongest increasing
   trend in precipitation was seen under the high-emission scenarios.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Groundwater resources consumption and management play a crucial role in
   food-energy- water nexus. However, the trends in groundwater storage
   variability and its attribution remain unclear because of the combined
   effects of climatic and anthropogenic terms. Here we use satellites and
   monitoring well observations to reveal the trends in groundwater storage
   change (GWSC), which exhibits geographical heterogeneity over the
   southeast side of the Hu Line in China during 1979-2012. The GWSC in
   northern China showed a slight decrease from 1979 to 1997, and the
   declining pattern extended to surrounding regions from 1998 to 2012. A
   considerable fraction of the GWSC trend can be attributed jointly to
   precipitation variations and human water usage. The anthropogenic
   factors that are primarily associated with socioeconomic development
   contribute to similar to 31\% of the variability in GWSC. Water
   management policies carried out in recent years reasonably explain the
   recovery of GWSC across regions with declining groundwater in 2013-2019.
   A positive trend in GWSC is further projected (2020-2029), though with
   uncertainties.},

Title = {Influence of the South American Low-Level Jet on the Austral Summer
   Precipitation Trend in Southeastern South America},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},

Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Austral summer precipitation increased by 27\% from 1902 to 2020 over
   southeastern South America (SESA), one of the largest centennial
   precipitation trends observed globally. We assess the influence of the
   South American low-level jet on the SESA precipitation trend by
   analyzing low-level moisture fluxes into SESA in two reanalysis datasets
   from 1951 to 2020. Increased moisture flux through the jet accounts for
   20\%-45\% of the observed SESA precipitation trend. While results vary
   among reanalyzes, both point to increased humidity as a fundamental
   driver of increased moisture flux and SESA precipitation. Increased
   humidity within the jet is consistent with warming sea surface
   temperatures driven by anthropogenic forcing, although additional
   natural climate variations also may have played a role. The jet's
   velocity also increased, further enhancing precipitation, but without a
   clear connection to anthropogenic forcing. Our findings indicate the
   SESA precipitation trend is partly attributable to jet intensification
   arising from both natural variability and anthropogenic forcing.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on investigating possible changes in
   hydrometeorological behavior on important Brazilian river basins for
   power generation purposes. Thereby, this research analyzes the
   historical averages and observed trends regarding rainfall and
   streamflow and their impact on the hydrological regime. Ten river basins
   were selected for the assessment of alterations in the precipitation and
   streamflow series throughout descriptive measures and statistical
   significance tests (Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope). These data are
   available over different time spans, but most of the records include
   information from 1961 to 2006. As long as these river basins are
   subjected to different climate types, their corresponding rainfall and
   streamflow patterns vary accordingly the basin location in the country,
   in addition to the season. Most of the country has a predominantly
   tropical climate, with a wet period concentrated between October and
   March and a dry period between April and September. Some exceptions are
   the Northeastern region, where the climate is semi-arid, besides the
   Southern region, where there is abundant precipitation throughout the
   year. According to the obtained results, it could be noted that the
   streamflow response to precipitation is faster in the smaller river
   basins, what can be due especially to the water travel time. It was
   found that Belo Monte basin, in Northern Brazil, presents a
   statistically significant reduction in the annual rainfall. Furthermore,
   a significant decrease in the annual streamflow was also identified in
   Xingo and Sobradinho basins, in the Northeastern region. In contrast,
   Itaipu basin, located in Southern Brazil, showed increasing
   statistically significant trends in annual rainfall and streamflow
   during the second half of the twentieth century. Relevant decreasing
   trends were also identified in the minimum streamflows of the Brazilian
   Northern and Northeastern basins and increasing ones in the maximum
   streamflows in the Southern region basins. The results obtained in this
   work will support the assessment of the impact of rainfall and
   streamflow future scenarios in regulating capacity of the hydroelectric
   power plant reservoirs.},

   found in the second part of the 20th century are unprecedented over the
   last 500 years in both regions. During the period 1715-1765, the
   precipitation trends were most pronounced in southwestern Norway as well
   as southern Spain/northern Morocco, with first a distinct negative trend
   followed by a positive countertrend of similar strength. Relating the
   precipitation time series to variations of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation Index (NAOI) and the solar irradiance using running
   correlations revealed a couple of instationarities. Nevertheless, it
   appears that the NAO is responsible in both regions for most of the
   significant winter precipitation trends during the earlier centuries as
   well as during recent decades. Some of the significant winter
   precipitation trends over southwestern Norway and southern
   Spain/northern Morocco might be related to changes in the solar
   irradiance.},

Abstract = {In this study, annual and seasonal precipitation trends and their
   connection with large-scale climate indices in the Qinling Mountains
   (QMs) were investigated using the innovative trend analysis (ITA), based
   on observed monthly precipitation data between 1959 and 2016 from 32
   meteorological stations. The results indicated a declining trend in
   annual precipitation in the QMs. Seasonally, a decreasing trend was also
   observed in spring and autumn, while increasing trends were observed in
   summer and winter. Spring and autumn precipitations significantly
   contributed to this observed decline in annual precipitation. More
   importantly, both low and high values indicated a declining trend, which
   would have a significant influence on ecology and livelihood in the QMs.
   Additionally, the results of wavelet coherence showed that annual
   precipitation is strongly associated with the East Asian Summer Monsoon
   Index (EASMI), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), South Asian Summer
   Monsoon Index (SASMI), South China Sea Summer Monsoon Index (SCSMI), and
   Southwest Australian Circulation Index (SWACI). However, its
   relationship with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and West African
   Summer Monsoon Index (WASMI) was insignificant, and seasonally, EASMI
   had negative effects on the precipitation in each season. It was also
   observed that spring and autumn precipitations were more sensitive to
   SOI than SWACI, while SASMI had a strong positive relationship with
   winter precipitation, and SCSMI was more negatively related to autumn
   and winter precipitation. This study will provide scientific basis for
   precipitation forecast, prevention, and mitigation of flood in the
   future.},

Title = {Trends in streamflow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater storage across
   the Amazon Basin linked to changing precipitation and land cover},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Study region: The study region is the Amazon River Basin, which controls
   globally important water and energy fluxes.
   Study focus: In the face of a changing climate and landscape, it is
   critical that we understand how, where, and why surface water resources
   are changing. Specifically, we must consider holistic changes to the
   water cycle to understand how water resources are affected by climate
   change and landscape alterations. In this study, we investigate changes
   to all major components of the water balance across the entire Amazon
   Basin. We seek to understand: 1) how changes to land cover and
   precipitation affect streamflow, 2) how these factors affect
   evapotranspiration and groundwater storage water balance components, and
   3) how changes to the water balance partitioning may in turn alter
   streamflows.
   New hydrological insights: We find significant changes to streamflow of
   +/- 9.5 mm/yr on average across the Amazon Basin. Streamflow alterations
   show a spatially variable pattern, with increasing discharge in the
   northern and western portions of the basin, and decreasing discharge in
   the southern and eastern basin. We also observe significant changes in
   evapotranspiration of +/- 29 mm/yr and groundwater storage increases of
   7.1 mm/yr. Together, these results indicate that studies of streamflow
   change in the Amazon should consider changes to the whole water budget,
   including understudied aspects of groundwater storage across the Basin.},

   duration the precipitation influence NDVI strongly during growing season
   of forest in different ecological aspects. The results showed that 1)
   the break points of NDVI and precipitation appeared in different years
   in most ecological zones, but in temperate continental forest and
   temperate mountain system, they have a high degree of consistency; 2)
   the NDVI in boreal coniferous forest, temperate mountain system and
   tropical moist deciduous forest showed a increasing trend during
   1982-2006 and the lowest value were appeared in different time and the
   precipitation in boreal coniferous forest and temperate mountain system
   showed a decreasing trend; 3) the forest in different ecological zones
   has different patterns with different periods and lags and the peak
   value of pearson correlation coefficients were showed in different
   duration and lag, and NDVI and precipitation generally have the negative

Title = {Spatial analysis of trends in extreme precipitation events in
   high-resolution climate model results and observations for Germany},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {114},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {A statistical extreme value analysis is applied to very high-resolution
   climate model results and observations encompassing the area of Germany.
   Two control runs representing the current climate, as well as three
   scenario simulations of the regional climate model REMO, are
   investigated. The control runs were compared against high-resolution
   observations. The analysis is divided into two main parts: first trends
   in extreme quantiles of daily precipitation totals are estimated in a
   station-by-station analysis. In the second part, the spatial
   characteristics of the estimated trends in heavy rainfall are
   investigated over the area of Germany by fitting a parametric
   geostatistical model to these trends. The rule of thumb of estimating
   trends in extreme quantiles of heavy precipitation based on the
   Clausius-Clapeyron relation, about 6.5\% per 1 degrees C temperature
   increase, has been roughly confirmed for Germany by our study with
   respect to the observations, but the climate model computes weaker
   trends. In the control simulations, the climate model tends to
   underestimate trends in heavy rainfall compared to observations. In the
   scenario simulations, positive trends prevail ( as in the observations).
   They are, however, relatively small when set in relation to the
   uncertainties. The trends become significantly positive to a larger
   spatial extent only in the A2 scenario simulation. The estimated shape
   of the extreme value distributions does not change significantly in the
   scenario simulations compared to the climate model control runs. The
   parameter estimates for the geostatistical model for the trends in
   extreme quantiles of daily precipitation sums are rather uncertain. The
   most striking feature of the analysis is a reduction of the spatial
   variance of the trends over the considered area of Germany in the
   scenario simulations compared to observations and, in particular, the
   climate model control runs.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal analysis and trends of extreme precipitation over
   the Mississippi River Basin, USA during 1988-2017},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {56},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Study region: Mississippi River Basin. Study focus: Using daily
   precipitation records of 769 meteorological stations over the
   Mississippi River Basin (MRB), the spatial-temporal variability and
   trend of nine extreme precipitation indices were estimated and
   statistically assessed using the Mann-Kendall test. Factors likely to
   influence the spatial pattern and trends of precipitation extremes
   indices were also checked. New hydrological insights for the region: The
   spatial pattern of the extreme precipitation indices exhibits a
   southeast to Northwest dipole, with the maximum values recorded over the
   southeastern part of the domain (exception being for Consecutive Dry
   Days, CDD which shows otherwise) driven by the southerly moisture
   transport toward the southeast. The spatial pattern of the extreme
   precipitation is controlled by the topography. The results also show
   that, on average, almost all the indices (except CDD) exhibit an
   increasing trend. The total wet day precipitation exhibits a significant
   increasing trend. Spatially, most of the significant increasing
   (decreasing) trends of the extreme's precipitation-except CDD- are
   located over the Upper (South) MRB where there is a significant sign
   toward cooling (warming) conditions. This supports the view that
   changing climate towards warming (cooling) conditions is significantly
   affecting precipitations extremes over the MRB. The relationships
   between large-scale teleconnections and extreme precipitation show that
   Pacific North America significantly increases (decreases) frequency and
   intensity indices over the Northwest (southeast) MRB, whereas the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation does increase the frequency and intensity
   indices over the southeast. El Ni \& ntilde;o Southern Oscillation
   significantly increases the frequency and intensity indices over the
   entire MRB, with consequences to infrastructure failures, increasing
   vulnerable populations, risk zones and relocations populations.},

   decreasing trend while Parachinar observed an increasing trend in almost
   all months except December. The trend results for seasonal rainfall
   showed a decreasing trend in winter, spring, and summer in the north and
   northeastern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa whereas an increasing trend was
   observed in all seasons at Parachinar. The RCP4.5 projections depicted
   an increase in precipitation especially in the monsoon-dominating
   regions in comparison to the western disturbances, while decreasing
   rainfall projection was observed in RCP8.5. The projections for the
   summer and winter seasons depicted an increasing trend until the
   mid-century but in the latter half, a decline is registered. Such
   seasonal changes may initially cause flooding followed by drought, which
   calls for effective water management strategies.},

Abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) and its forms has recently been a focus of attention due to
   its toxic effects on human health and the environment. We evaluated the
   atmospheric deposition of Cd during three consecutive winter seasons
   (2009-2011) at 10 mountain-top locations in the Czech Republic along the
   borders with Poland, Germany, Austria and Slovakia. Cadmium
   concentrations of soluble and insoluble forms in both horizontal (rime)
   and vertical (snow) deposition were determined using sector-field
   ICP-MS. Across the sites, 94\% of the total winter Cd deposition
   occurred in the soluble (environmentally available) Cd form. Mean
   concentrations of soluble Cd in rime were six times higher than in snow
   (398 vs. 66 ng L-1). Vertical deposition contributed as much as 41\% to
   the total winter Cd input. Between-site variability in Cd deposition was
   large, ranging between 13 and 108 mu g m(-2) winter(-1). Overall, Cd
   concentrations in winter deposition did not reach the drinking water
   limits and did not pose a direct threat for human health. Long-term
   trends (1996-2017) in winter Cd deposition were evaluated at six GEOMON
   sites (a monitoring network of small forested catchments). Since 1996,
   Cd input in winter atmospheric deposition decreased by 73-93\%.
   Simultaneously, we found declines in between-site variability in winter
   Cd inputs. The highest recent winter Cd inputs were found at sites
   located in the northeast of the country. A north-south pollution
   gradient, which has frequently been mentioned in the literature, was not
   observed, with both northwestern sites and southern sites being among
   those with the lowest Cd pollution. Backward trajectories of the HYSPLIT
   model for fresh snow samples identified Poland and Germany as major
   transboundary Cd pollution sources for the Czech Republic. (C) 2020

Title = {Effects of persistence and large-scale climate anomalies on trends and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {550},
Pages = {453-465},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Slowly varying (trend) and abrupt (change points) changes in annual
   maximum daily precipitation (AMP) and seasonal maximum daily
   precipitation (SMP) across Canada for 223 stations in six regions during
   four periods (1900-2010, 1930-2010, 1950-2010 and 1970-2010) were
   analyzed. Variants of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test considering influences
   of short-term persistence (STP), long-term persistence (LTP) and
   large-scale climate anomalies on trend detection were applied to detect
   trends, and the Pettitt test was used to evaluate change points. The
   results indicate that there was a mix of increasing and decreasing
   trends for Canadian AMPs and SMPs. Most regions in Pacific Maritime,
   central Boreal regions and the Atlantic Maritime showed an increase in
   AMP, while a decrease in Canadian Prairies and most Boreal regions. More
   stations showing statistically significant increases than decreases in
   spring, summer and autumn SMPs were found while there was a
   statistically significant decrease (increase) in winter SMP over
   southern (northern) Canada. LTP significantly increased the likelihood
   of trends detected in AMPs and SMPs. The effects of STP on the trend
   detection were also evident as shown by the differences in results
   obtained from the MK tests with and without considering the effect of
   STP. The effects of large-scale climate anomalies on trends were
   significant for winter SMPs. More than 1/4 of stations were detected
   with statistically significant change points in AMPs and SMPs which
   occurred around 1960-1990. More stations showed significant change
   points than trends, and winter showed more evident trends and change
   points in SMPs than other three seasons. Trends and change points
   detected were field-significant. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Observed and model simulated changes in precipitation are examined using
   vertical motion at 500 hPa to define ascending and descending branches
   of the tropical circulation. Vertical motion fields from reanalyses were
   employed to subsample the observed precipitation data. An emerging
   signal of rising precipitation trends in the ascending regions and
   decreasing trends in the descending regimes are detected in the
   observational datasets. These trends are substantially larger in
   magnitude than present-day model simulations and projections into the
   21st century. The discrepancy cannot be explained by changes in the
   reanalysis fields used to subsample the observations but instead must
   relate to errors in the satellite data or in the model parametrizations.
   This has important implications for future predictions of climate
   change, the reliability of the observing system and the monitoring of
   the global water cycle.},

Abstract = {Climate change and urbanization collectively influence precipitation
   changes. However, their separate potential contributions to
   precipitation changes are not well understood due to their complex
   interactions. Hence, a trajectory-based method was used to separate
   their potential contributions across national, regional and local scales
   in China. Precipitation changes in non-urban regions can be regarded as
   representing the influence of climate change and can serve as a
   reference for isolating precipitation changes due to urbanization in
   urban areas. Our results revealed that climate change was the dominant
   factor for precipitation trends, while urbanization exhibited a
   relatively weak influence, especially for extreme precipitation at the
   national scale. At the regional scale, the impacts of urbanization on
   precipitation became more significant. About 20.2 and -30.6\% of
   positive and negative trends in total precipitation originated from
   urbanization. At the local scale, the potential contribution of
   urbanization was strongly correlated with local environmental
   characteristics. Although there were differences in the potential
   contributions of climate change and urbanization at national, regional
   and local scales, climate change was the dominant factor for
   precipitation trends and urbanization acted as a regulator to drying or
   wetting due to precipitation under climate change. In general,
   urbanization causes a greater impact on total precipitation than on
   precipitation extremes. Due to this, attribution approach is static and
   broad-based and does not render the level of confidence that is needed
   for scale-aware attribution, future studies are needed to understand the
   physical mechanisms of impacts of local environment changes on
   precipitation trends at different geographical locations over China.},

Abstract = {Monthly precipitation data from Huangtai Bridge Station were used to
   study seasonal and annual precipitation characteristics and trend. The
   covered time-period is from 1956 to 2007. Different methods including
   linear regression, 5-year moving average, anomalies in decadal scale and
   the Mann-Kendall test were applied in the study. Nearly two-thirds of
   the total rainfall amount is concentrated in summer, with autumn and
   spring months to follow, and only about 3\% in winter. An increasing
   trend in spring months is found. It starts in 1978, becomes significant
   after 2002, and probably continues into the future. A decreasing trend
   is recorded in winter and begins in 1980. No significant trend is found
   in summer, autumn and yearly precipitation. The same fluctuations are
   observed between summer and annual precipitation indicating the dominant
   influence of the summer season.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the effects of external forcing agents such as
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, as well as solar variability and
   ozone, on global land monsoon precipitation by using a coupled climate
   model HadGEM1, which was developed by the Met Office Hadley Centre for
   Climate Research. The results indicate that HadGEM1 performs well in
   simulating the observed decreasing trend of global land monsoon
   precipitation over the past 50 years. This trend mainly occurred in the
   Northern Hemisphere and is significantly different from the trend of
   natural variability due to ocean-atmosphere-land interactions. The
   coherence between the simulation and the observations indicates that the
   specified external forcing agents, including GHGs and aerosols as well
   as solar variability and ozone, are important factors that have affected
   the decreasing trend of global land monsoon precipitation in the past 50
   years.},

Title = {Impact of Trend Estimates on Predictive Performance in Model Evaluation
   for Spatial Downscaling of Satellite-based Precipitation Data},
Journal = {KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-35},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Spatial downscaling with fine resolution auxiliary variables has been
   widely applied to predict precipitation at fine resolution from coarse
   resolution satellite-based precipitation products. The spatial
   downscaling framework is usually based on the decomposition of
   precipitation values into trend and residual components. The fine
   resolution auxiliary variables contribute to the estimation of the trend
   components. The main focus of this study is on quantitative analysis of
   impacts of trend component estimates on predictive performance in
   spatial downscaling. Two regression models were considered to estimate
   the trend components: multiple linear regression (MLR) and
   geographically weighted regression (GWR). After estimating the trend
   components using the two models, residual components were predicted at
   fine resolution grids using area-to-point kriging. Finally, the sum of
   the trend and residual components were considered as downscaling
   results. From the downscaling experiments with time-series Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 precipitation data, MLR-based
   downscaling showed the similar or even better predictive performance,
   compared with GWR-based downscaling with very high explanatory power.
   Despite very high explanatory power of GWR, the relationships quantified
   from TRMM precipitation data with errors and the auxiliary variables at
   coarse resolution may exaggerate the errors in the trend components at
   fine resolution. As a result, the errors attached to the trend estimates
   greatly affected the predictive performance. These results indicate that
   any regression model with high explanatory power does not always improve
   predictive performance due to intrinsic errors of the input coarse
   resolution data. Thus, it is suggested that the explanatory power of
   trend estimation models alone cannot be always used for the selection of
   an optimal model in spatial downscaling with fine resolution auxiliary
   variables.},

Title = {Precipitation reconstruction for the southern Altay Mountains (China)
   from tree rings of Siberian spruce, reveals recent wetting trend},
Journal = {DENDROCHRONOLOGIA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {266-272},
Abstract = {We developed six tree-ring width chronologies of Siberian spruce (Picea
   obovata) from the low elevation forest of the southern Altay Mountains
   in northern Xinjiang, China. Although the six chronologies come from
   different sampling sites, significant correlations existed among the
   chronologies (r >= 0.477), and the first principal component (PC1)
   accounted for 72.2\% of total variance over their common period
   1825-2010. Correlation response analysis revealed that radial growth of
   Siberian spruce is mainly limited by a 12-month precipitation starting
   from July of the previous year to June of the current year. We therefore
   developed a July-June precipitation reconstruction spanning 1825-2009,
   which explained 65.5\% of the instrumental variance for the period
   1962-2009. The information of our precipitation reconstruction suggested
   that dry conditions existed for the periods 1829-1838, 1852-1855,
   1876-1888, 1898-1911, 1919-1923, 1932-1936, 1943-1955, 1963-1968,
   1973-1984 and 2007-2009, and wet conditions for the periods AD
   1825-1828, 1839-1851, 1856-1875, 1889-1897, 1912-1918, 1924-1931,
   1937-1942, 1956-1962, 1969-1972 and 1985-2006. Spatial climate
   correlation analyses with gridded land surface data revealed that our
   precipitation reconstruction contains a strong precipitation signal for
   the Altay Mountain ranges. Our reconstruction agreed with the
   moisture-sensitive tree ring width series of Siberian larch from the
   Altay Mountains of Mongolia on a decadal timescale. In addition, in
   contrast to a drying trend in north central China, a clear wetting trend
   has occurred in the southern Altay Mountains since 1980s. (C) 2014

Title = {Temporal trends in the stable isotope composition of precipitation: a

Abstract = {Stable isotopes in precipitation are recognized as a major tool for
   tracking the water cycle. The development of gridded datasets is a
   solution to the need for high-resolution isotopic data. The lack of
   measurement though, dictates the use of ``long-term average{''} isotopic
   values, usually, calculated from short time series, of unequal durations
   and, sometimes, not even referring to the same time period. Thus, the
   influence of possible trends, that might be present in the isotopic
   data, should be accounted for. In the present work, we investigated the
   existence of temporal trends in the isotopic composition of
   precipitation of central Europe and eastern Mediterranean. Nine stations
   were selected, having time series extending over at least a 20-year-long
   period and fulfilling certain data completeness criteria. Possible
   trends were detected for three overlapping 20-year periods (1961-1980,
   1971-1990, and 1981-2000) using linear regression, the Mann-Kendall
   test, and a partial Mann-Kendall test, to compensate for the influence
   of meteorological parameters. We found that very few cases present
   statistically significant trends. There is significant variability of
   the observed trends, both on a seasonal and on a station basis, in the
   central Europe and the eastern Mediterranean area alike. Overall, the
   insignificance of the observed isotopic trends, and the lack of any
   coherent spatial and temporal patterns, seems to be supporting the
   current practice for estimating the long-term average isotopic
   composition of precipitation.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of this study is to perform trend analysis in the historic
   data sets of annual and crop season {[}May-September] precipitation and
   daily maximum and minimum temperatures across the southwest United
   States. Eighteen ground-based weather stations were considered across
   the southwest United States for a total period from 1902 to 2017. The
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test method was used for the significance of
   the trend analysis and the Sen's slope estimator was used to derive the
   long-term average rates of change in the parameters. The results showed
   a decreasing trend in annual precipitation at 44.4\% of the stations
   with the Sen's slopes varying from -1.35 to -0.02 mm/year while the
   other stations showed an increasing trend. Crop season total
   precipitation showed non-significant variation at most of the stations
   except two stations in Arizona. Seventy-five percent of the stations
   showed increasing trend in annual maximum temperature at the rates that
   varied from 0.6 to 3.1 degrees C per century. Air cooling varied from
   0.2 to 1.0 degrees C per century with dominant warming phenomenon at the
   regional scale of the southwest United States. Average annual minimum
   temperature had increased at 69\% of the stations at the rates that
   varied from 0.1 to 8 degrees C over the last century, while the annual
   temperature amplitude showed a decreasing trend at 63\% of stations.
   Crop season maximum temperature had significant increasing trend at
   68.8\% of the stations at the rates varying from 0.7 to 3.5 degrees C
   per century, while the season minimum temperature had increased at 75\%
   of the stations.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of trends in annual and seasonal
   precipitation over Germany during 1951-2013 were analysed using the
   ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. Three widely used
   and recognized high-resolution observation-based gridded precipitation
   products, the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) time-series data, Global
   Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) Full Data Reanalysis data and
   the EU-FP6 project ENSEMBLES derived data set (EOBS), were used and
   compared. Comparison among different products showed that the CRU used a
   considerably lower number of gauge stations (maximum 36) in the
   construction of gridded product over Germany and should be used with
   great caution for other applications, and overall CRU presented less
   precipitation and smaller inter-annual variability; GPCC and EOBS agreed
   well in the spatial and temporal distribution of seasonal and annual
   precipitation, as well as the identified trends. The spatiotemporal
   analysis of trends showed that trends in precipitation during 1951-2013
   were, in most cases, highly nonlinear and varying over time. In
   particular, the spring, summer and autumn precipitation showed large
   variations in trends. Therefore, the assumption of linear trends on
   which previous studies were based is invalid. Annual precipitation
   showed increasing trends in over 66\% of Germany (particularly northern
   and eastern Germany), and the magnitude of increasing trends were
   generally enhanced over time, e.g. GPCC showed that the average
   magnitude of increasing trends rose from 6.3\% for the 1951-1980 period
   to 12\% for the 1951-2013 period. There were considerable spatial and
   temporal variabilities in trends in seasonal precipitation totals over
   Germany. This study is among one of the first studies applying the EEMD
   method to a comprehensive analysis of time-varying trends in
   precipitation over Germany, which is expected to improve our
   understanding of the complex and nonlinear regional climate system.},

Title = {Refining the cheatgrass-fire cycle in the Great Basin: Precipitation
   timing and fine fuel composition predict wildfire trends},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Number = {19},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Larger, more frequent wildfires in arid and semi-arid ecosystems have
   been associated with invasion by non-native annual grasses, yet a
   complete understanding of fine fuel development and subsequent wildfire
   trends is lacking. We investigated the complex relationships among
   weather, fine fuels, and fire in the Great Basin, USA. We first modeled
   the annual and time-lagged effects of precipitation and temperature on
   herbaceous vegetation cover and litter accumulation over a 26-year
   period in the northern Great Basin. We then modeled how these fine fuels
   and weather patterns influence subsequent wildfires. We found that
   cheatgrass cover increased in years with higher precipitation and
   especially when one of the previous 3 years also was particularly wet.
   Cover of non-native forbs and native herbs also increased in wet years,
   but only after several dry years. The area burned by wildfire in a given
   year was mostly associated with native herb and non-native forb cover,
   whereas cheatgrass mainly influenced area burned in the form of litter
   derived from previous years' growth. Consequently, multiyear weather
   patterns, including precipitation in the previous 1-3 years, was a
   strong predictor of wildfire in a given year because of the time needed
   to develop these fine fuel loads. The strong relationship between
   precipitation and wildfire allowed us to expand our inference to 10,162
   wildfires across the entire Great Basin over a 35-year period from 1980
   to 2014. Our results suggest that the region's precipitation pattern of
   consecutive wet years followed by consecutive dry years results in a
   cycle of fuel accumulation followed by weather conditions that increase
   the probability of wildfire events in the year when the cycle
   transitions from wet to dry. These patterns varied regionally but were
   strong enough to allow us to model annual wildfire risk across the Great
   Basin based on precipitation alone.},

Title = {The emergence of anthropogenic signal in mean and extreme precipitation
   trend over China by using two large ensembles},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic warming may impact mean and extreme precipitation trends
   by enhancing the water cycle, potentially bringing threats to human
   societies. The design of national-level policy for disaster prevention
   and mitigation depends on the reliable detection of anthropogenic
   forcing in mean and extreme precipitation changes there. The
   anthropogenic signal might be obscured by strong internal variability at
   a regional scale. The goal of this study is to investigate the emergence
   of anthropogenic signal in mean and extreme precipitation trends across
   China by using two large ensembles (CanESM2-LE and Community Earth
   System Model (CESM)-LE) of simulations during 1961-2010. Results show
   that the signal could not be detected in either mean or extreme
   precipitation trend during the current climate period (1961-2010).
   Following the RCP8.5 scenario, the signal is projected to emerge in mean
   precipitation around the 2020s and 2030s in the CanESM2-LE and CESM-LE,
   respectively, much earlier than in extreme precipitation. For extreme
   precipitation, the signal could be steadily detected no earlier than the
   2030s for CanESM2-LE and the 2040s for CESM-LE. These projected times of
   emergence in precipitation changes highlight the urgency of preparing
   for an uncharted hydrological future dominated by anthropogenic warming.},

Title = {Recent trends and ENSO influence on droughts in Northern Chile: An
   application of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Pages = {51-58},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Northern and central Chile is one of the driest regions of the
   Arid-Americas with increasing demands on finite water supplies. The
   region faces recurrent droughts that cause important economic damages.
   The need to better monitor drought and study changes in their main
   properties is important for disaster risk management.
   The aim of this work is to apply the Standardized Precipitation
   Evapotranspiration Index (SPE) to detect trends of thy periods of
   different magnitude as well as to describe their association with El
   Nino phenomenon in the Coquimbo region.
   Data shows that dry events are frequent in the region, and that spring
   and summer show negative trends (i.e. increasing dryness) in most of the
   stations analyzed. Significant trends for SPE values are in the order of
   -0.05 yr(-1). The occurrence of dry conditions of different magnitude
   has increased over the last decades, and the duration of extreme
   climatic events has slightly increased as well. These results are
   consistent with future climatic projections and represent a major
   challenge for water resources management and the operation of existing
   reservoirs. (C) 2013 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {An in-depth understanding of event-based extreme precipitation (EEP),
   emphasizing precipitation process, can help to prevent the risk posed by
   regional high-intensity and persistent precipitation. The concept of
   time distribution pattern (TDP) is used to distinguish EEPs, which
   classifies EEPs according to the occurrence time of extreme
   precipitation. Furthermore, TDP1,2,3 is that the distribution of daily
   precipitation above the threshold is in the first half, in the second
   half, and both the first half and second half of EEP, respectively. We
   analyze temporal characteristics, spatial distribution, future trends of
   EEP, and the contribution rate of urbanization to EEP in this study. EEP
   thresholds exhibit a latitudinal gradient from central to northern and
   southern regions except for Nanyue Station (NY). TDP1 and TDP2 account
   for more than 60\% among the total of EEPs. However, TDP3 is the
   dominant precipitation type observed at each station from the
   perspective of precipitation, intensity, duration, especially, in
   summer. EEP is less and TDP is unstable in autumn and winter. In
   general, there is an increasing trend in EEP and it is predicted that
   the trend of EEP will continue to rise. Moreover, the contribution rate
   of urbanization to EEP varies significantly, with a more pronounced
   inhibitory effect observed. The inhibitory effect of urbanization on the
   frequency and duration of TDP3 reached 60.83\% and 72.77\%,
   respectively. However, it is more significant on the extreme nature of
   TDP1 under urbanization, with a positive contribution rate of 9.63\% and
   21.83\% to precipitation and intensity of TDP1, respectively. The
   results conclude that the higher the level of urbanization, the more
   pronounced the extreme trend of TDP1 becomes.},

Title = {The trends in land surface heat fluxes over global monsoon domains and
   their responses to monsoon and precipitation},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The climatology, trends and leading modes of land surface latent heat
   flux (LHF) and sensible heat flux (SHF) as well as their responses to
   monsoon and precipitation in global land monsoon domains are presented.
   During the past three decades, LHF and SHF have generally undergone a
   rising and decreasing trend (that is, (LHF+, SHF-)), respectively, in
   Asian, North African, Austrian, and South American monsoon domains.
   Moreover, the increasing rate of LHF was higher than the decreasing rate
   of SHF, which causes a decreased trend in Bowen ratio. Two other
   dominant trend patterns, (LHF-, SHF-) and (LHF+, SHF+), are observed in
   South African and South American monsoon domains, respectively. The
   trends in LHF and SHF are closely linked to increasing global monsoon
   intensity and precipitation, especially for the monsoon domain that has
   annual precipitation lower than 1300 mm yr(-1). Singular value
   decomposition (SVD) analyses show that monsoon strength explains 25.2\%
   and 22.2\% total covariance of LHF and SHF respectively in the first
   modes, and that precipitation slightly raises the percentages up to
   27.8\% and 24\% respectively. The increasing monsoon and precipitation
   on one hand favor more land surface available energy being converted
   into LHF; on the other hand they enhance the LHF by increasing the land
   surface net radiation. Moreover, remarkable phase shifts in LHF and SHF
   are observed for monsoon domains during late-1990s, which are in phase
   with those of precipitation and monsoon strength. The intensifying LHF
   and precipitation indicate the acceleration of hydrological cycle in
   global terrestrial monsoon domains.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {245},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Understanding temporal and spatial changes in precipitation has
   far-reaching implications for watershed development and risk assessment
   under global climate change. In our study, temporal and spatial
   variability in precipitation concentration (PC) in Central Asia (CA)
   from 1980 to 2017, measured with the precipitation concentration index
   (PCI) and Gini Coefficient (GC), was analyzed using interpolated
   precipitation from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The results showed that:
   (1) interpolated precipitation increased significantly, with significant
   mutations (P < .5) mainly concentrated between 2000 and 2010; (2) the
   spatial distribution of the CPC PCI was opposite to that of the NCEP
   PCI, and fluctuations in CPC GC were larger than that of the NCEP, which
   indicated that the precipitation data from NCEP was more uniform over
   the year; (3) for two of three interpolation methods, CPC PC displayed
   significant mutations in southern CA between 1985 and 2005, while
   significant (P < .05) mutations in NCEP PC were relatively concentrated
   in southern CA between 1987 and 2005; (4) although the El Nino Modoki
   Index (EMI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Nino 3.4, and Southern
   Oscillation Index (SOI) displayed resonance relationships with CPC PCI,
   there were no significant abrupt changes in the resonance correlation.
   In the NCEP data, EMI, PDO, Nino 3.4, and North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) led to mutations in the resonance relationship with PCI. Our
   research proved that the change in PC in CA had closely relationship
   with some teleconnection indices.},

Title = {Regional precipitation trends since 1500 CE reconstructed from calcite
   sublayers of a varved Mediterranean lake record (Central Pyrenees)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {826},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean region is expected to be highly impacted by global
   warming, although the uncertainty of future scenarios, particularly
   about precipitation patterns remains quite large. To better predict
   shifts in its current climate system and to test models, more regional
   climate records are needed spanning longer than the instrumental period.
   Here we provide a high-resolution reconstruction of autumn precipitation
   for the Central Pyrenees since 1500 CE based on annual calcite sublayer
   widths from Montcortes Lake (Central southern Pyrenees) varved
   sediments. The 500-yr calcite data series was detrended and calibrated
   with instrumental climate records by applying correlations and
   cross-correlations to regional precipitation anomalies. Highest
   relationships were obtained between a composite calcite series and
   autumn precipitation anomalies for the complete calibration period
   (1900-2002) and for the two halves of the full period. Applied
   statistical tests were significant, evidencing that the climatic signal
   could be reconstructed.
   The reconstructed precipitation anomalies show interdecadal shifts, and
   rainfall decrease within the coldest period of the LIA and during the
   second half of the 20th century, probably associated to current Global
   Warming. Neither increasing nor decreasing linear trends or periods of
   extreme precipitation events were identified. Our results are coherent
   with other palaeohydrological reconstructions for northern Iberian
   Peninsula. Correlations between the predicted autumn precipitation and
   the main teleconnections -NAO, ENSO and WEMO- were weak, although a
   potential relationship with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)
   pattern is suggested.
   The obtained reconstruction provides the first estimations of regional
   autumn precipitation shifts in the Central Pyrenees and is one of the
   few reconstructions that cover annual-to-century scale climate
   variability of precipitation in the Mediterranean region from the end of
   the Litte Ice Age (LIA) to the current period of Global Warming.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall are governed by complex
   interactions between climate and landscape perturbations including
   deforestation, fire, and drought. Previous research demonstrated that
   rainfall in portions of the Amazon Basin has intensified, resulting in
   more extreme droughts and floods. The basin has global impacts on
   climate and hydrologic cycles; thus, it is critical to understand how
   precipitation patterns and intensity are changing. Due to insufficient
   precipitation gauges, we analyzed the variability and seasonality of
   rainfall over the Amazon Basin from 1982 to 2018 using high-resolution
   gridded precipitation products. We developed several precipitation
   indices and analyzed their trends using the Mann-Kendall test (Mann
   1945; Kendall, 1975) to identify significant changes in rainfall
   patterns over time and space. Our results show landscape scale changes
   in the timing and intensity of rainfall events. Specifically, wet areas
   of the western Basin have become significantly wetter since 1982, with
   an increase of 182 mm of rainfall per year. In the eastern and southern
   regions, where deforestation is widespread, a significant drying trend
   is evident. Additionally, local alterations to precipitation patterns
   were also observed. For example, the Tocantins region has had a
   significant increase in the number of dry days during both wet and dry
   seasons, increasing by about 1 day per year. Surprisingly, changes in
   rainfall amount and number of dry days do not consistently align.
   Broadly, over this 37-year period, wet areas are trending wetter and dry
   areas are trending drier, while spatial anomalies show structure at the
   scale of hundreds of kilometers.},

Title = {Examining why trends in very heavy precipitation should not be mistaken
   for trends in very high river discharge},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {133},
Number = {4},
Pages = {681-693},

Abstract = {It is firmly established in the hydrologic literature that flooding
   depends on both antecedent watershed wetness and precipitation. One
   could phrase this relationship as ``heavy precipitation does not
   necessarily lead to high stream discharge{''}, but rarely do studies
   directly affirm this statement. We have observed several
   non-hydrologists mistake trends in heavy precipitation as a proxy for
   trends in riverine flooding. If the relationship between heavy
   precipitation and high discharge was more often explicitly presented,
   heavy precipitation may less often be misinterpreted as a proxy for
   discharge. In this paper, we undertake such an analysis for 390
   watersheds across the contiguous U.S. We found that 99th percentile
   precipitation only results in 99th percentage discharge 36 \% of the
   time. However, when conditioned on soil moisture from the Variable
   Infiltration Capacity model, 62 \% of 99th percentile precipitation
   results in 99th percentile discharge during wet periods and only 13 \%
   during dry periods. When relating trends in heavy precipitation to
   hydrologic response, precipitation data should, therefore, be segregated
   based on concurrent soil moisture. Taking this approach for climate
   predictions, we found that CMIP-5 atmosphere-ocean global circulation
   model (AOGCM) simulations for a RCP 6.0 forcing project increases in
   concurrence of greater than median soil wetness and extreme
   precipitation in the northern United States and a decrease in the south,
   suggesting northern regions could see an increase in very high
   discharges while southern regions could see decreases despite both
   regions having an increase in extreme precipitation. While the actual
   outcome is speculative given the uncertainties of the AOGCM's, such an
   analysis provides a more sophisticated framework from which to evaluate
   the output as well as historic climate data.},

Abstract = {The Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayas (HKH) mountainous range supplies water
   to 10 river basins serving eight countries. The present study focuses on
   the river basins located within the HKH region in Pakistan. The modified
   Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+) was used to split the research
   region into 13 sub-basins. The Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope, innovative
   polygon trend analysis (IPTA), and innovative trend analysis (ITA)
   methods were used for the monthly precipitation time series. The Shyok
   sub-basin (central Karakoram) experienced rising trends for all seasons,
   while the southwestern Karakoram (Hunza) showed a rising trend only for
   the winter. The Hindukush Mountain Range feeds five sub-basins (Gilgit,
   Chitral, Swat, Kabul, and Kurram). The Gilgit and Kurram sub-basins
   observed an upward trend for all seasons. A falling trend in spring and
   transition from spring (falling) to summer (rising) was observed for the
   Swat and Kabul sub-basins. The Chitral sub-basin received rising
   precipitation in spring, summer, and autumn, whereas no trend was
   observed during winter. In the southern Himalayas (Kanshi and Jhelum),
   no trend was observed in winter and autumn and a falling trend in spring
   and summer. The Kunhar sub-basin (southern Himalaya) showed rising
   trends in winter, spring, and autumn. In contrast, the Soan sub-basin
   (eastern Himalaya) has no trend in spring, and other seasons show rising
   trends. The sub-basin Upper Indus experienced a rising trend for autumn,
   winter, and summer, while a downward trend was observed in spring. The
   IPTA and ITA approaches are much more sensitive than the Mann-Kendall
   method in detecting trends. Although the innovative methods are mostly
   compatible with each other (90\%), the IPTA presents additional
   information about trend transitions between successive parts of the time
   series. The results presented in this study are an advancement in the
   investigations made so far in this region and will help to understand
   the climate and hydrology of this region.},

Abstract = {The Amazon Basin is the region with the highest continental water
   density in the world and plays an important role in the global
   hydroclimatic system and the carbon cycle. In recent decades, the Amazon
   Basin has seen intense land use and land cover change (LULCC),
   specifically in terms of the conversion of rainforest into crop and
   livestock areas. The feedback mechanisms between the surface and
   atmosphere have been modified and biodiversity has also been endangered.
   In order to establish the long-term hydrological trends across the
   Amazon Basin and possible relationships with LULCC, monthly data on
   streamflow and precipitation obtained from surface stations and remote
   sensing of deforestation information from 1976 to 2010 were analyzed.
   Homogeneous streamflow sub-regions were determined, and assessments of
   these sub-regions show distinct patterns: while the trend for both
   rainfall and streamflow is positive in the northern basin, in the North
   and Amazon-Mouth sub-regions, the trend is negative for both variables
   in the southern basin, the West, South, and Central sub-regions. In the
   regions with a negative trend, the yearly deforestation rate presented
   high values, indicating the possible influence of LULCC on the Amazon's
   hydrological cycle. Seasonal analysis shows that the reductions in
   streamflow and rainfall rates in the southern Amazon Basin were more
   frequently registered at the end of the dry season, indicating a
   prolonging of this season. Analysis with Global Precipitation
   Climatology Centre (GPCC) linear trend data relating the positive peak
   of Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) to the negative period shows that
   the negative trend for rainfall and streamflow in the South sub-region
   is more intense than the influence of PDO. This reinforces the
   hypothesis that deforestation may be influencing the hydrological cycle
   in the Amazon Basin.},

Abstract = {In the context of an arid area such as Souss Massa Region, the
   availability of time series analysis of observed local data is vital to
   better characterize the regional rainfall configuration. In this paper,
   dataset of monthly precipitation collected from different local
   meteorological stations during 1932-2010, are quality controlled and
   analyzed to detect trend and change points. The temporal distribution of
   outliers shows an annual cycle and a decrease of their number since the
   1980s. The results of the standard normal homogeneity test, penalized
   maximal t test, and Mann-Whitney-Pettit test show that 42\% of the
   series are homogeneous. The analysis of annual precipitation in the
   region of Souss Massa during 1932-2010 shows wet conditions with a
   maximum between 1963 and 1965 followed by a decrease since 1973. The
   latter is identified as a statistically significant regional change
   point in Western High Atlas and Anti Atlas Mountains highlighting a
   decline in long-term average precipitation.},

Journal = {RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events have emerged as one of the main manifestations of
   climate change, being that the mitigation of the elapsed impacts demand
   studies of the magnitude and frequency of their occurrence. This study
   aims to identify the trends of extreme precipitation events in the
   Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, especially concerning their
   frequency. The trends of precipitation were studied with especial regard
   to the indices set by ETCCDMI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection
   Monitoring and Indices), including time series of annual number of rainy
   days above a certain threshold recorded at fourteen rainfall gauging
   stations. One stage of this study consisted in surveying the flood
   occurrence in the area, besides analyzing the precipitation data
   corresponding to date of flood occurrences, in order to establish a
   threshold value beyond which an event would entail potential impacts. No
   regional index pattern could be set based on such results, although the
   rainfall station located in the city of Belo Horizonte reported a
   statistically significant increase in daily precipitation events above
   10, 20, 30 and 40 mm, in maximum precipitation recorded over five
   consecutive days, in daily intensity, and in total annual precipitation.
   Abrupt changes in rainfall series were also recorded. The results have
   indicated that the city may be potentially impacted by extreme rainfall
   increase, probably associated to changes in temperatures on regional and
   local scales.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal distribution and
   performance of seasonal precipitation in all districts of Haryana,
   India. We analysed the gridded precipitation dataset of the India
   Meteorological Department (IMD) for a period of 120 years (1901-2020)
   using different statistical methods. We found that Haryana received a
   mean precipitation of 37.0, 37.7, 468.3, and 24.8 mm during the winter,
   pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. During
   each season, the eastern districts of Haryana received more
   precipitation than its western counterparts. Sen's slope results
   obtained after trend-free pre-whitening (TFPW) showed a statistically
   significant increasing trend of 0.12 mm (p-value; 0.04) during the
   pre-monsoon period, whereas decreasing but non-significant trends were
   observed during the winter, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons at the rate
   of -0.04 mm (p-value; 0.49), -0.26 mm (p-value; 0.52), -0.05 mm
   (p-value; 0.33) per year, respectively, for the entire Haryana state.
   The winter precipitation is expected to increase under the
   Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario, whereas
   pre-monsoon precipitation is expected to decrease under the RCP8.5
   scenario by the end of the 21st century. The monsoon precipitation is
   expected to decrease under all RCP scenarios, whereas post-monsoon
   precipitation is expected to gradually increase under the RCP8.5
   scenario by the end of the 21st century.},

Abstract = {The paper reports chemical data on the atmospheric precipitation within
   the studied area of the Valdai National Park during monitoring in
   2015-2018. The main parameters of atmospheric precipitation as well as
   major and trace-element compositions of waters are analyzed. Seasonal
   dynamics and possible pathways of element uptake in atmospheric
   precipitation are considered. Multidimensional statistical analysis
   (PCCA, RDA analyses) was applied to determine geochemical and
   anthropogenic factors responsible for the formation of the chemical
   composition of atmospheric precipitation. Precipitations penetration
   through tree crown are enriched in organic matter and some elements. The
   high contents of N, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu found in subcrown waters indicate
   a predominant biogenic migration of the elements with atmospheric
   fallouts. The elevated contents of Cu and Zn, as well as Cd and Pb in
   the atmospheric fallouts of the Valdai National Park suggest that the
   studied area experiences a regional-scale anthropogenic load.},

Abstract = {Climate warming is projected to result in increases in total annual
   precipitation in northeastern North America. The response of runoff to
   increases in precipitation is likely to be more complex because
   increasing evapotranspiration (ET) could counteract increasing
   precipitation. This study was conducted to examine these competing
   trends in the historical record for 22 rivers having >70 yr of runoff
   data. Annual (water year) average precipitation increased in all basins,
   with increases ranging from 0.9 to 3.12 mm yr(-1). Runoff increased in
   all basins with increases ranging from 0.67 to 2.58 mm yr(-1). The ET
   was calculated by using a water balance approach in which changes in
   terrestrial water storage were considered negligible. ET increased in 16
   basins and decreased in 6 basins. Temporal trends in temperature,
   precipitation, runoff, and ET were also calculated for each basin over
   their respective periods of record for runoff and for the consistent
   period (1927-2011) for the area-weighted average of the nine largest
   non-nested basins. From 1927 through 2011, precipitation and runoff
   increased at average rates of 1.6 and 1.7 mm yr(-1), respectively, and
   ET increased slightly at a rate of 0.18 mm yr(-1). For the more recent
   period (1970-2011), there was a positive trend in ET of 1.9 mm yr(-1).
   The lack of a more consistent increase in ET, compared with the
   increases in precipitation and runoff, for the full periods of record,
   was unexpected, but may be explained by various factors including
   decreasing wind speed, increasing cloudiness, decreasing vapor pressure
   deficit, and patterns of forest growth.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the long-term trends of precipitable water and
   precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau using satellite and surface
   measurements. The results show that precipitable water in the 680-310
   hPa layer of the atmosphere has increased significantly since the 1990s,
   with an upward trend of 6.45 cm per decade and particularly high
   increases in summer. However, precipitation has not shown a
   significantly increasing trend, and the land surface has become drier in
   parts of the Himalayas. The increased moisture in the atmosphere may be
   the result of two processes: (1) the rapid melting of glaciers and snow
   over the Tibetan Plateau due to enhanced regional warming and (2) a
   small increase in water vapor transported from low-latitude ocean
   sources and the Arabian Sea. Analyses of precipitation, evaporation, and
   the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) indicated that the water
   resources on the Tibetan Plateau are decreasing and that the water
   storage capacity in the Himalayas may be permanently lost. (C) 2012

Title = {The Role of Precipitation and Salinity Effect in Multidecadal Changes

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Multidecadal variability of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is crucial
   for the Indo-Pacific and global climate due to significant interbasin
   exchanges of heat and freshwater. Previous studies suggest that both
   wind and buoyancy forcing may drive ITF variability, but the role of
   precipitation and salinity effect in the variability of ITF on
   multidecadal time scales remains largely unexplored. Here, we
   investigate the multidecadal changes and long-term trend of the ITF
   transport during the past six decades, with a focus on the role of
   precipitation and salinity effect. The diverse datasets consistently
   indicate a substantial upward trend in the halosteric component of
   geostrophic transport of ITF in the outflow region at 1148E during the
   six decades. We find that the meridional differences of the salinity
   trend in the outflow region explain the increasing trend of the
   halosteric component of ITF transport. On a larger scale, the tropical
   western Pacific Ocean and Indonesian seas have experienced significant
   freshening, which has strengthened the Indo-Pacific pressure gradient
   and thus enhanced the ITF. In contrast, the equatorial trade wind in the
   western Pacific Ocean has weakened over recent decades, implying that
   changes in wind forcing have contributed to weakening the ITF. The
   combined effect of strengthened halosteric and weakened thermosteric
   components has resulted in a weak strengthening for the total ITF with
   large uncertainties. Although both the thermosteric and halosteric
   components are associated with natural climate modes, our results
   suggest that the importance of salinity effect is likely increasing
   given the enhanced water cycle under global warming.},

Abstract = {The waters of the Paraiba do Sul River supply around 15 million people,
   most of whom live in metropolitan regions of the state of Rio de
   Janeiro. Climate change alters its precipitation regime and can cause an
   increase in the occurrence of extreme hydrological events. Furthermore,
   the variability of precipitation can result from the combined effects of
   the surface conditions of the oceans and the variations in the dynamics
   of atmospheric systems. This work aims to detect possible changes in the
   climatic extremes of precipitation in the Paraiba do Sul hydrographic
   basin and to investigate evidences of correlation of these indices with
   the oceanic oscillations associated with the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Results indicate that the northeast
   sector of the basin present trends of increase in the total annual
   precipitation, in the number of very humid days and in the occurrence of
   extreme events, in a space of time up to five days. The southwest
   sector, on the other hand, show decreasing trends in total annual
   precipitation, in the number of very humid days, but with an increase
   trend in the maximum amount of rainfall on five consecutive days. The
   central sector has characteristics of a transition zone. The correlation
   analyzes show that oceanic oscillation indices have a non-significant
   correlation with most annual extreme precipitation indices, except for
   La Nina (El Nino), that can increase (decrease) the number of
   consecutive dry days in the region. Besides, for austral autumn, La Nina
   (El Nino) can decrease (increase) the precipitation in the basin, and in
   austral winter, hot (cold) phase of AMO can decrease (increase) the
   precipitation. For austral spring, two teleconnections were found: hot
   (cold) phase of PDO can increase (decrease) the precipitation in the
   southwest region of the basin, and during El Nino (La Nina) years,
   negative (positive) precipitation anomalies tend to occur in the
   northeast sector of the basin, while positive (negative) anomalies
   appear in its southwest region. The wavelet spectrum of precipitation
   anomaly indicates significant values with low power that could be
   correlated with ENSO, corroborating the results of seasonal
   correlations.},

Abstract = {In his comments, Wang cites a number of works to dispute the conclusion
   in our previous work, which attributes the observed decreases/increases
   in light/heavy precipitation in eastern China primarily to global
   warming rather than the regional aerosol effect. However, most of the
   cited works (admittedly, including our previous work), employ
   correlation analysis, which has little bearing on the cause-effect
   relationship. Theoretical analyses and/or modeling studies are needed to
   ascertain the cause-effect relationship. We argue that theoretical
   analyses and modeling results show that global warming is the primary
   cause of the widely observed phenomena of suppression of light
   precipitation and enhancement of heavy precipitation across the globe,
   including in eastern China.},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {The analysis of annual or seasonal data can lead to misinterpretation of
   spatio-temporal rainfall distribution. A high percentage of total annual
   precipitation can fall in just a few days, causing floods or landslides.
   Large economic losses from these events are particularly common in Peru,
   where the daily precipitation has been poorly investigated. This study
   presents a spatio-temporal analysis of concentration index over the
   Mantaro River basin in the central Peruvian Andes. Daily rainfall data
   recorded at 46 rainfall stations between 1974 and 2004 were selected in
   this study. In terms of average values, the analysis of daily rainfall
   indicates that low-intensity events account for 38 \% of rainy days but
   only approximately 9 \% of the total rain amount. In contrast, high- and
   very high-intensity events account for 35 \% of rainy days and
   approximately 71 \% of the total rain amount. The results also indicate
   higher concentration and lower intensity over the Northern and Central
   regions, compared to Southern region of the basin. Rainfall
   concentration gives evidence of why some of these places are more likely
   to be affected by extreme weather events; spatial distribution of event
   intensity can be partly explained by daily rainfall heterogeneity and
   orography. Moreover, Mann-Kendall test mostly shows a significant change
   toward a weaker seasonality of daily precipitation distribution over
   high-mountain regions.},

Abstract = {Understanding extreme precipitation is very important for Ethiopia,
   which is heavily dependent on low-productivity rainfed agriculture but
   lacks structural and nonstructural water regulating and storage
   mechanisms. There has been an increasing concern about whether there is
   an increasing trend in extreme precipitation as the climate changes.
   Existing analysis of this region has been descriptive, without taking
   advantage of the advances in extreme value modeling. After reviewing the
   statistical methodology on extremes, this paper presents an analysis
   based on the generalized extreme value modeling with daily time series
   of precipitation records at Debre Markos in the Northwestern Highlands
   of Ethiopia. We found no strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis
   that there is no increasing trend in extreme precipitation at this

Abstract = {On a local and regional level, climate change has had a significant
   impact on precipitation in the global climatic state. The purpose of
   this research is to examine the trend and character of urban
   precipitation in the world's most densely inhabited metropolis. From
   1981 to 2020, 40 years of monthly and annual precipitation data from 50
   major metropolitan cities throughout the world, based on population
   statistics, were analysed. The monthly and annual precipitation analysis
   was done using a homogeneity test, shifting point test, non-parametric
   Modified Mann Kendall test, and also through computing the magnitude of
   the trend using Sen's slope estimate. According to the findings of the
   study, the most homogeneous data was obtained in May (90 \%) and the
   least in September (74\%). In 2002, the highest number of breakpoints
   were found in July (9 cities) and August (8 cities). The month of
   January has the largest significant positive trend (10 cities) whereas
   annually it has 20 cities. The monthly maximum of the significant
   negative trend was discovered in February (4 cities) and annually in 2
   main cities. In November, the maximum positive and minimum positive
   Sen's slope values were found to be 82\% and 56\%, respectively. The
   findings of this study are important for future water resource
   projections, flood or drought predictions, and engineering, scientific,
   industrial, agricultural, and social studies. The goal of this research
   is to come up with a good plan for dealing with urban flash floods and
   droughts as precipitation acts as the key parameter of the hydrological
   cycle.},

   RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 future climate scenarios. After evaluating the
   modeling capability of the WRF model, the six future climate projections
   were dynamically downscaled by means of the WRF model over Northern
   California at 9 km grid resolution and hourly temporal resolution during
   a 94-year period (2006-2100). The biases in the model simulations were
   corrected, and basin-average precipitation over the eight study
   watersheds was calculated from the dynamically down-scaled precipitation
   data. Based on the dynamically downscaled basin-average precipitation,
   trends in annual depth and annual peaks of basin-average precipitation
   during the 21st century were analyzed over the eight study watersheds.
   The analyses in this study indicate that there may be differences
   between trends of annual depths and annual peaks of watershed-scale
   precipitation during the 21st century. Furthermore, trends in
   watershed-scale precipitation under future climate conditions may be
   different for different watersheds depending on their location and
   topography even if they are in the same region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {In the Montseny mountains (NE Spain), bulk deposition data from 1983 to
   1994 revealed a significant decrease of SO42- concentrations and
   deposition (of 19\% for 5 yr means), but non-significant trends for
   NO3-, NH4+, the base cations or alkalinity concentrations or deposition,
   The pH distribution of weekly samples shifted to higher values: the
   median pH increased From 4.74 (H+ concentration, 18.2 mu eq l(-1)) in
   year 1983-84 to 5.50 (H+ concentration, 3.2 mu eq l(-1)) in year
   1993-94. Base cations and alkalinity concentrations and deposition were
   strongly depedent on the occurrence of sporadic events of red rains from
   the Saharan region, which are rich in alkalinity and base cations.
   Excluding such red rains, SO42- concentration still showed a significant
   decrease(p = 0.014) over the study period while alkalinity increased (p
   = 0.08). This is an indication that the reduction of S emissions due to
   the abatement regulations at an European scale of approximately 37\% has
   had an effect on the bulk deposition over NE Spain, and that, leaving
   apart the high, but unpredictable, inputs of alkalinity and base cations
   from the Saharan region, there is an increase;in the alkalinity of
   precipitation.},

Abstract = {Trends of six (moderately) extreme precipitation indices in Southern
   Poland and Central-Eastern Germany were analysed for 1951-2006, using 43
   daily precipitation datasets. The analysis of the variability of the
   spatial extent of significant trends, their stability and average
   magnitude showed a strong seasonal differentiation and long-term
   variability. The most distinct changes in extreme precipitation occured
   in summer; particularly obvious in the 30-year moving periods from the
   mid 1960s to the mid -90s. Spatial variability of trend directions is
   large within the region. In the central and eastern parts, decreasing
   trends in extreme precipitation occured more frequently while increasing
   trends prevailed in the western part of the region This pattern also
   emerged in the spatial distribution of trend stability.},

Abstract = {Assessing the spatial and temporal variability of climate data is one of
   the basic requirements to solve the hydrological and water management
   problems. In this manuscript, a comprehensive assessment of data
   quality, precipitation concentration index (PCI), Mann-Kendall (MK)
   trend test, and extreme climate change indices analyses were performed.
   The standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT), the Pettitt test, the
   Buishand range test, and the Von Neumann ratio test were used for
   homogeneity analysis, and most of the climate stations exhibited
   homogenous precipitation series. The annual mean and dry season PCI
   values demonstrated higher spatial and temporal variability or irregular
   distribution of precipitation, whereas PCI in the wetter seasons
   indicated low precipitation concentration in the Upper Awash basin. The
   MK trend test exhibited a significantly increasing trend of maximum
   temperature; however, the trend of mean annual and extreme precipitation
   events was insignificant for the majority of stations. Moreover, the
   magnitude and trend of ten main extreme precipitation indices were
   constructed. Unlike the mean annual precipitation, larger values of the
   extreme 1-day (Rx1day) and 5-day (Rx5day) annual precipitation were
   obtained in the downstream areas of the basin which could signify the
   prevalence higher flood risk in this portion of the basin. The highest
   predicted 100-year annual maximum daily (AMD) precipitation was obtained
   at Zikuala station as 128.5 mm. Statistical analysis of the magnitude
   and trend of extreme precipitation indices and spatial variability of
   climate data is imperative for the integrated water resource planning
   and management decisions.},

Abstract = {Precipitation is the most critical climatic element that directly
   affects the availability of water resources. The objective of this study
   was to describe and discuss spatio-temporal patterns of annual
   precipitation, its aggressiveness, and its concentration along the
   southwest coast of South America (36 degrees-49 degrees S) from 1930 to
   2006. An annual and multi-decadal analysis was applied to 107 sampling
   stations distributed throughout this region, using the Mann-Kendall test
   (MK), and the Sampling Uncertainty Analysis (SUA) coupled with Gumbel
   probability density function (SUA-Gumbel). The analysis revealed
   positive but not significant trends in annual precipitation and
   aggressiveness for the region between 36 degrees and 44 degrees S, at
   least during the last 50years of the analysed period. However, a
   significant decrease in annual precipitation and aggressiveness was
   observed between 44 degrees and 49 degrees S during the same period. The
   annual concentration of precipitation became slightly more seasonal in
   the last 50years within the entire study area.},

Abstract = {Recent drought over the Great Plains has had significant impacts on
   agriculture and the economy, highlighting the need for better
   understanding of any ongoing changes in the regional hydroclimate.
   Trends in the Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ) during the months
   April-June and associated precipitation are analyzed using the North
   American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) for the period 1979-2012. Linear
   trends computed for meridional winds and precipitation intensity,
   frequency, and total across the Great Plains show that (1) the GPLLJ has
   strengthened and expanded northward and (2) precipitation has decreased
   substantially in the Southern Plains while increasing in the Northern
   Plains. Particularly in May, the rainy season in the Oklahoma-Texas
   region, precipitation has migrated northward in correspondence to the
   shifted northern edge of the GPLLJ, leading to near 50\% declines in
   precipitation since 1979. These observed changes are discussed in the
   context of recent droughts and projected climate for the region.},

   statistically significant declines at the majority of sites for NHx (sum

   nitric acid) in air. Model calculations and measurements give similar
   results. We demonstrate that the lack of trends for xNO(3) in air at
   least partly can be attributed to a shift in the equilibrium between
   nitric acid and ammonium nitrate towards particulate phase, caused by
   reductions in the sulfur dioxide emissions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Detecting trends in regional large-scale circulation (LSC) is an
   important challenge as LSC is a key driver of local weather conditions.
   In this work, we investigate the past evolution of western Europe LSC
   based on the 500 hPa geopotential height fields from 20CRv2c
   (1851-2010), ERA20C (1900-2010) and ERA5 (1950-2010) reanalyses. We
   focus on the evolution of large-scale circulation characteristics using
   three atmospheric descriptors that are based on analogy by comparing
   daily geopotential height fields to each other. They characterize the
   stationarity of geopotential shape and how well a geopotential shape is
   reproduced in the climatology. A non-analogy descriptor is also employed
   to account for the intensity of the centers of action. We then combine
   the four atmospheric descriptors with an existing weather pattern
   classification over the period 1950-2019 to study the recent changes in
   the two main atmospheric influences driving precipitation in the
   northern French Alps. They correspond to the Atlantic circulation
   pattern dominated by a zonal flow and the Mediterranean circulation
   pattern dominated by low-pressure anomalies over the near Atlantic,
   close to Portugal. Even though LSC characteristics and trends are
   consistent among the three reanalyses after 1950, we find major
   differences between 20CRv2c and ERA20C from 1900 to 1950 in accordance
   with previous studies. Notably, ERA20C produces flatter geopotential
   shapes in the beginning of the 20th century and shows a reinforcement of
   the meridional pressure gradient that is not observed in 20CRv2c. Over
   the period 1950-2019, we show that winter Atlantic circulations (zonal
   flows) tend to be shifted northward, and they become more similar to
   known Atlantic circulations. Mediterranean circulations tend to become
   more stationary, more similar to known Mediterranean circulations and
   associated with stronger centers of action in autumn, while an opposite
   behavior is observed in winter. Finally, we discuss the role of these
   LSC changes for seasonal and extreme precipitation in the northern
   French Alps. We show that these changes in LSC characteristics are
   linked to (a) the decreasing contribution of Mediterranean circulations
   to winter precipitation and (b) more circulations that are likely to
   generate extreme precipitation in autumn.},

Title = {Trend reversal of soil <i>n</i>-alkane Carbon Preference Index (CPI)
   along the precipitation gradient and its paleoclimatic implication},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},

Abstract = {Homologue distribution proxies of leaf wax n-alkanes (normal chain
   alkanes) have been widely used for chemotaxonomy and paleoclimate
   reconstruction, while modern calibrations of them reported contrasting
   conclusions in different climate settings, especially between the cold
   arid and other climate regions. To further explore n-alkane-abiotic
   factor correlation in cold arid regions, this study surveyed n-alkane
   patterns of soil and leaf wax of three plant species along confined
   temperature and precipitation gradients in the Junggar Basin of
   northwest China. Our results show that salinity has a possible strong
   constraint on the Average Chain Length (ACL) of soil n-alkanes in high
   salinity settings, while precipitation or water stress is the leading
   constraint on the Carbon Preference Index (CPI) of those in low salinity
   settings. Precipitation also shows strong control over CPI or ACL of
   leaf wax n-alkanes of different plant species. Our results confirmed
   that n-alkane patterns are sensitive to, and constrained by abiotic
   factors independently on levels of plant species and averaged biome. A
   compilation of soil CPI from transect studies across the hot-humid to
   cold-arid regions of China further revealed precipitation being the
   first-order constraint of soil CPI, and a CPI trend reversal pattern
   along the precipitation gradient, where CPI increases from arid to
   semiarid climate and then decreases toward humid climate. Further
   analysis of existing CPI records showed that this CPI trend reversal may
   help differentiate three climate states qualitatively, i.e. arid,
   semiarid-semihumid and humid climates, which could be a valuable
   complement to existing proxies for paleoclimate reconstruction.},

   period 2021-2050 and 2051-2080 with respect to the current climate

   concentration pathways (RCPs) of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 were used to
   assess the future trend of the study area. Results indicate that the
   increasing RCP increases temperature (maximum and minimum) in all
   regions due to higher radiative forces (4-8.5 W/m2) with respect to the
   baseline temperature during the period 2051-2080. Further, the
   bias-corrected rainfall has a declined trend with respect to baseline,
   and RCP's values for both the time slices (2021-2050 and 2051-2080)
   showed less scattering in the amount of rainfall for the wet season in

Title = {Impacts of global warming on summer precipitation trend over
   northeastern Eurasia during 1990-2010 using large-ensemble experiments},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Summer precipitation (June-August) increased markedly during the 2000s
   in Siberia, particularly in eastern Siberia. However, the nature of the
   mechanism that controlled this increase in precipitation remains under
   discussion. This study investigated the impacts of global warming on the
   trend of summer precipitation over northeastern Eurasia using
   large-ensemble data from historical warming and nonwarming simulations
   for 1990-2010. Positive summer precipitation trends across Siberia
   reproduced in the ensemble mean of the historical simulation were
   similar to the observed data; however, negative trends observed over
   northeast China and Mongolia were not found in the ensemble mean. To
   extract members with a pattern of precipitation trend similar to that of
   the observations, empirical orthogonal function analysis was applied to
   the summer precipitation trend over Siberia for each simulation. The
   first leading mode in each simulation showed increase (decrease) in
   precipitation over eastern Siberia (northeast China), consistent with
   the spatial features of the observations. In the extracted members, the
   spatial pattern of the cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulation trend over
   northern parts of eastern Siberia (northeast China), associated with
   decadal and multidecadal variation, was amplified by global warming and
   resulted in an increasing trend of westerly moisture flux into eastern
   Siberia from western Siberia. Additionally, surface heating in northeast
   China, enhanced by global warming, might concurrently have intensified
   the cyclonic circulation over eastern Siberia. Furthermore, the results
   suggested that the reduced extent of Arctic sea ice coverage played a
   role in strengthening the cyclonic circulation over eastern Siberia and
   enhancing water vapour transport from the Arctic Ocean, which
   contributed to the strength of the westerly moisture flux over eastern
   Siberia. Although notable impacts of global warming on the precipitation
   trend in northeastern Eurasia were found, internal variation in the
   model experiments was also likely to have affected the precipitation
   trend, particularly in mid-latitude regions.},

Abstract = {Extreme precipitation events will cause serious disasters, and their
   changing trends require thorough evaluation. Spatial distribution and
   temporal trends of extreme precipitation events were analyzed based on
   the daily precipitation data of 27 meteorological stations in the
   Hengduan Mountains region from 1961 to 2012. Twelve indices of
   precipitation extreme were studied. The results were as follows: except
   for consecutive dry days, consecutive wet days and maximum 5-day
   precipitation, other indices of precipitation extreme demonstrated
   non-significant increasing trends, and most indices fluctuated from 1961
   to 2012. Increasing trends in precipitation indices were greater than
   those in precipitation days. The spatial distribution for precipitation
   extremes exhibited a declining trend from southwest to northeast, which
   reflected regional differences and the influence of topography in the
   Hengduan Mountains region. Furthermore, the relationship between
   precipitation extremes and elevation indicated that precipitation
   extreme events decreased with altitude. The extreme precipitation
   indexes had positive correlations with the annual total precipitation,
   and their correlation coefficients were statistically significant at the
   1\% significance level, except for consecutive dry days. Continuous
   wavelet transform analysis presented significant periodic variations
   with periods of 2-4 year, 5-year, and 10-year in the extreme
   precipitation, and there was a 2-4 year resonance cycle with the
   South/East Asian summer monsoon index. The South/East Asian Summer
   Monsoon was an important influence on precipitation extremes in the
   Hengduan Mountains region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Abstract = {Time series of South African temperatures were investigated for temporal
   and spatial trends for the period 1960 to 2003. For this purpose a total
   of 26 climate stations were utilized, with each having sufficient data
   available and not having undergone major moves or changes in exposure
   that would influence the homogeneity of their data series. The vast
   majority, a total of 23 stations, showed positive trends in their annual
   mean maximum temperature series. 13 of them significant, with trends
   higher for central stations than those closer to the coast. Annual mean
   minimum temperatures showed 21 stations having positive trends, with 18
   significant. Stations not showing significantly positive trends in
   annual mean minimum temperatures were mostly situated in the central
   interior. The annual average temperature data series of 24 of the
   stations showed positive trends, with 18 of them significant. Trends of
   mean seasonal temperature showed that temperature trends are not
   consistent throughout the year, with the average trend for autumn
   showing a maximum and spring a minimum. Monthly trends of average annual
   temperatures showed large differences in trend between stations. and for
   each station between months, but similar tendencies in trend between
   months were found to exist for stations close by and also for groups of
   stations on a regional basis. Trends in diurnal temperature range are
   almost equally divided between positive and negative, with the positive
   trends in the central interior mainly being caused by positive trends in
   maximum temperature. It is also shown that, in general, days and nights
   with relatively high temperatures have increased, while days and nights
   with relatively low temperatures have decreased. The effects of
   urbanization on temperature trends are investigated, and the conclusion
   is that most stations regarded as urban stations are still useful for
   trend analysis; being situated on the outskirts of cities they are,
   therefore, not substantially influenced by the urban heat island. El
   Nino and La Nina events do not seem to play a significant role in the
   increasing temperatures observed. Copyright (C) 2004 Royal

Title = {Global and regional sea surface temperature trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Pages = {3801-3818},
Abstract = {Individual sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are calculated using
   a satellite-based climatology and observations from the World Ocean
   Atlas 1994 (WOA94) and the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set
   (COADS) to characterize global and regional changes in ocean surface
   temperature since 1942. For each of these datasets, anomaly trends are
   computed using a new method that groups individual anomalies into
   climatological temperature classes. These temperature class anomaly
   trends are compared with trends estimated using a technique
   representative of previous studies based on 5 degrees latitude-longitude
   bins.
   Global linear trends in the data-rich period between 1960 and 1990
   calculated from the WOA94 data are found to be 0.14 degrees +/- 0.04
   degreesC decade(-1) for the temperature class approach and 0.13 degrees
   +/- 0.04 degreesC decade(-1) for the 5 degrees bin approach. The
   corresponding results for the COADS data are 0.10 degrees +/- 0.03
   degreesC and 0.09 degrees +/- 0.03 degreesC decade(-1). These trends are
   not statistically different at the 95\% confidence level. Additionally,
   they agree closely with both SST and land-air temperature trends
   estimated from results reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change. The similarity between the COADS trends and the trends
   calculated from the WOA94 dataset provides confirmation of previous SST
   trend studies, which are based almost exclusively on volunteer observing
   ship datasets like COADS.
   Regional linear trends reveal a nonuniformity in the SST rates between
   1945-70 and 1970-95. Intensified warming during the later period is
   observed in the eastern equatorial Pacific, the North Atlantic
   subtropical convergence, and in the vicinity of the Kuroshio extension.
   Also, despite close agreement globally, localized differences between
   COADS and WOA94 trends are observed.},

Abstract = {For this study, characteristics and trends of the chemical constituents
   in bulk precipitation and streamwater were observed in a small
   mountainous watershed on the Shikoku Island of Japan, which covered an
   area of 27.4 hectares. Bulk precipitation and streamwater chemistry data
   spans from May 1997 to October 2004, and January 1996 to October 2004,
   respectively. The data were tested for two types of trends: (1) a
   monotonic trend to determine if concentrations of the chemical
   constituents were generally decreasing, increasing, or stable during the
   study period, and (2) a step trend to determine if a change occurred
   following the December 1999-January 2000 forest thinning. Both
   parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were carried out in
   this study. Although the study area is only 35 km away from the Pacific
   Ocean, bulk precipitation chemistry was also influenced by terrestrial
   sources to a large extent. Streamwater chemistry was influenced by
   bedrock weathering, which was dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3-, and was not
   strongly related top recipitation chemistry.Non-parametric Seasonal

Abstract = {This paper assessed the potential impacts of trends detected in
   rainfall, temperature and wind speed on hydro and wind power resources
   in Burundi. Two climatic stations located at two contrasting regions,
   namely Rwegura catchment and northern Imbo plain, were considered.
   Rainfall, temperature and wind speed observed data were considered for
   the period 1950-2014 and future projection data from seven Regional
   Climate Models (RCMs) for the period 2021-2050 were used. The
   interannual variability analysis was made using standardized variables.
   Trends and rupture were respectively detected through Mann-Kendall and
   Pettitt non-parametric tests. Mann-Whitney and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
   were considered as subseries comparison tests. The results showed a
   downward trend of rainfall while temperature and wind speed revealed
   upward trends for the period 1950-2014. All models projected increases
   in temperature and wind speed compared to the baseline period 1981-2010.
   Five models forecasted an increase in rainfall at northern Imbo plain
   station while four models projected a decrease in rainfall at Rwegura
   station. November was forecasted by the ensemble mean model to slightly
   increase in rainfall for both stations. Therefore, the country of
   Burundi may benefit more if it plans to invest in wind power.},

Abstract = {In characterizing the patterns of climate change across Saudi Arabia,
   several extreme indices are calculated from station values daily maximum
   and minimum temperature data. The trend analyses are performed on 13
   annual extreme indices for Saudi Arabia, using observations from 27
   surface stations with high-quality data for the period 1981-2010.
   RClimDex is used to calculate the indices, and simple regression methods
   are employed for the trend analysis. The analyses of extreme temperature
   indices detected a significant increase in the majority of the stations,
   which further indicates that the country has experienced a warming
   trend. The findings show that 92/89\% of the stations displayed a
   significant increase in the annual occurrence of warm days/nights and
   96/93\% revealed a significant decrease for the occurrence of cool
   days/nights. Time-series analysis has also shown an important feature of
   the climate change signal. When the dataset is divided into two
   sub-periods, the analysis reveals a distinctive long-term trend that
   clearly distinguishes the two periods. It was found that the temperature
   extremes (hot and cold) in Saudi Arabia have increased significantly
   with greater magnitude in the recent-past (1996-2010) compared to the
   previous period (1981-1995). The most telling evidence for this is the
   heat- and cold-waves, where indices of both have occurred more
   frequently in the second part of the two sub-periods.},

   for their high metallicities. However, the differences between the solar
   photospheric and meteoritic abundances do display a weak but significant
   trend with condensation temperature. This suggests that the metallicity

   minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall were collected
   from the Agrometeorology laboratory of Sri Karan Narendra Agriculture
   University, Jobner (Jaipur). Trend lines were fitted for minimum
   temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall and their significance is
   tested making use of the Mann-Kendall test. The increasing but
   non-significant trend was observed in minimum temperature whereas
   maximum temperature showed a significant increase over time which was
   confirmed by Mann-Kendall trend test. Rainfall showed non-significant
   decreasing trend for the given period.},

Abstract = {Changes in the temperature and precipitation have significantly affected
   water resources and agricultural productions in many countries across
   the world. The objective of the present study is to analyze the changing
   patterns of annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature in Iraq
   for the period 1961-2010. Monthly gridded precipitation and temperature
   data of Global precipitation climate center (GPCC) and climate research
   unit (CRU) respectively having a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees were
   used in this study to show the spatial pattern in trends. The rate of
   change in rainfall and temperature was estimated using Sen's slope
   method while the significance of change was confirmed using Mann-Kendal
   test (MK) and the modified Mann-Kendall test (mMK). The results revealed
   large differences in the number of grid points showing significant
   changes in rainfall and temperature using MK and mMK methods. The mMK
   method revealed that the annual rainfall is decreasing at a rate of -1.0
   to -5.0mm/year in the northwest part of Iraq. The seasonal
   precipitations were found to decrease in spring (-0.4 to -2.56mm/year)
   and winter (-0.4 to -2.0mm/year), increase in summer (0.06 to
   0.21mm/year) at a few grid points and no change in autumn. On the other
   hand, a sharp rise in annual average of daily mean (0.42 to 0.64 degrees
   C/decade), maximum (0.39 to 0.65 degrees C/decade) and minimum (0.36 to
   0.69 degrees C/decade) temperature was observed.},

Abstract = {Understanding the trend of temperature and rainfall is of prime
   importance for climate change related research. This research aims to
   identify the trends of temperature and rainfall for the last 50 years
   (1966-2015) for Bangladesh. To detect the trends, the non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test in combination with a trend-free prewhitening approach
   for correcting the time series to eliminate the influence of serial
   correlation has been used whereas the Sen's slope method is used for
   identification of the trend value. Maximum, minimum, and mean monthly
   temperatures have been analyzed to identify the monthly, seasonal and
   annual trend. Four seasons are distinct in Bangladesh, namely,
   pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter. In case of rainfall, mean
   monthly rainfall, 1-day maximum rainfall and consecutive 3-day maximum
   rainfall are analyzed in a similar fashion. For maximum, minimum and
   mean monthly temperature, the majority of the stations show an
   increasing trend for all three indices. Monsoon season observes highest
   increasing trend of 0.015 degrees C/yr for mean monthly temperature
   whereas the winter season shows the negative trend of - 0.002 degrees
   C/yr. On an annual basis, the trend is increasing with a value of 0.008
   degrees C/yr or 0.4 degrees C in 50 years having significance level, p <
   .05. On the other hand, mean rainfall shows an increasing trend for the
   three seasons except for winter, however, significance level in this
   case is p > .10. The trend of mean rainfall for annual basis shows an
   increasing trend of 5.675 mm/yr. The trend in one day and consecutive
   three-day maximum rainfall depicts that the trend is increasing in few
   places whereas in other places the trend is decreasing with no
   significant change. The research concludes that the climate of
   Bangladesh is getting cooler and drier for winter, on the other hand,
   warmer and wetter for the rest of the year.},

   throughout the Brazilian Legal Amazon for the period 1973-2013. Annual,
   wet season and dry season trends were quantified by Sen's slope for each
   station and the entire region. The Mann-Kendall test was used to
   determine the statistical significance of the trends. For the whole
   region, minimum, maximum and average annual temperatures showed
   increasing trend of approximately 0.04 degrees C per year. The rainfall
   showed an insignificant trend for most stations for annual and seasonal
   series. Nevertheless, some stations showed significant increasing trends
   in the annual and wet season rainfalls while a few stations showed
   decreasing trends for the dry season rainfall. A positive trend of the
   annual range between wet and dry season rainfall was found in some
   stations, caused mainly by an increasing trend in wet season rainfall.},

Abstract = {In this study, long-term annual and monthly trends in mean maximum, mean
   minimum and mean temperature are investigated at 35 synoptic stations in
   Iran. The statistical significance of trends is assessed by the
   Mann-Kendall test. Most stations, especially those in western and
   eastern parts of country, had significant positive trends in monthly
   temperature time series in summer season. However, the maximum number of
   stations with the positive trend were observed in April (30 stations),
   and then in August (29 stations) while the negative trends were seen in
   February (16 stations) and March (15 stations). On annual scale, most
   stations in western and southern parts of Iran had significant positive
   trend. Overall, about 71\%, 66\% and about 40\% of stations had
   statistically significant trends in mean annual temperature, mean annual
   minimum temperature and in mean annual maximum temperature,
   respectively. These results, however, indicate that the climate in Iran
   is growing warmer, especially in summer.},

Abstract = {In this study, the variability and trends of the mean annual and
   seasonal surface air temperature in Greek peninsula are examined. The
   climatic data used, concern mean monthly values of air temperature of 20
   meteorological stations of the Hellenic Meteorological Service, for the
   period 1951-2000.
   The air temperature time series for each station are analyzed, so that
   the variability and trends be described. Regarding the annual time
   series, a cooling trend is observed since the early 1960's till the
   middle of the decade of 1970, when the trend reverses to heating till
   nowadays. It is remarkable that the today air temperature levels do not
   exceed the levels of the middle of the century. During the winter, it is
   crystal clear that a cooling trend exists from the middle of the decade
   of 1950 to the end of the decade of 1980, especially in the south region
   of the country. Afterwards an increasing trend is obvious till nowadays.
   The pattern in spring appears a slight heating trend in the northern
   region of Greece and a cooling trend in the south. The summer time
   series are similar to the annual ones, so the contribution of summer to
   annual variability is unquestionable. Generally speaking, the air
   temperature in autumn follows the same distribution in time.
   In the process, the Factor Analysis is applied on the mean annual and
   seasonal air temperature and thereafter the regions, within the air
   temperature covariates, are defined. Finally, the application of
   spectral analysis to annual and seasonal air temperature is regarded
   necessary so that the periodicities are derived.},

Abstract = {Failure in components that may contain defects and that operate at
   elevated temperatures can occur by creep, fatigue, or fast fracture, or
   some combination of these processes. Frequently, these components
   include welds and repairs to welds. Codes and standards are available
   for assessing the structural integrity of these types of components.
   This paper addresses the main issues of concern in making safety
   assessments and reliable lifetime predictions for situations where creep
   processes dominate. Emphasis is placed on the creep component of
   cracking. Initially, models of crack initiation and growth are reviewed.
   The creep fracture mechanics parameter C{*} is used to make predictions.
   The influence of constraint on the mechanisms responsible for void
   nucleation and growth is considered and creep crack growth rate laws
   derived. Methods of calculating C{*} in components from the plastic
   fracture mechanics parameter J or, approximately, from stress intensity
   factor K and limit analysis using reference stress concepts are
   described. A procedure for making remaining life assessments for
   cracking into progressively deteriorating material is considered.
   Techniques for dealing with an initial transient phase, or incubation
   period, during which damage builds up at a crack tip are presented. An
   indication of the scatter to be expected in creep crack growth data, for
   use in sensitivity studies, is provided. The role of residual stress on
   the early stages of cracking and subsequent crack propagation is
   discussed.},

   temporal trends and coefficients of variations (CV) were analyzed based
   on the yearly mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. The findings in
   this study were: (1) Good statistical consistency (R-2 = 0.794) and the
   same trends were found only in mean temperature between LST-UHI and
   SAT-UHI. There are 54\% of cities that showed opposite temporal trends
   between LST-UHI and SAT-UHI for minimum temperature while the percentage
   was 38\% for maximum temperature. (2) The high discrepancies in temporal
   trends were observed for all cities, which indicated the inadequacy of
   LST for obtaining reliable UHI trends especially when using the maximum
   and minimum temperatures. (3) The larger uncertainties of LST-UHI were
   probably due to high inter-annual fluctuations of LST. The topography
   was the predominant factor that affected the UHI variations for both LST
   and SAT. Therefore, we suggested that SAT should be combined with LST to
   ensure the dependable temporal series of UHI. This paper provided
   references for understanding the UHI effects on various surfaces.},

Abstract = {The observed changes in the climate system during the last decades have
   generated a growing popular concern, especially in the scientific world,
   which has led to a series of research on the causes and possible
   consequences of climate change. This is a topic of great interest
   worldwide, including in Mexico. The Altiplano Potosino Region, Mexico,
   is located in the northwestern part of the state of San Luis Potosi,
   Mexico, with an approximate area of 29 119 km(2), with an annual
   rainfall lower than 400 mm and an annual average temperature of 17.5
   degrees C. Groundwater is the main source of supply because surface
   runoff is limited. The objective of this study was to perform a time
   series analysis of the historical records of rainfall and temperature,
   at the meteorological stations located in the study region from the
   period 1975 to 2015, to identify spatial and temporal trends and
   patterns. For this, the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used. The
   results indicate both increased and decrease trends in the annual and
   monthly periods for the variables analyzed. Trends suggest local
   behaviors. Monthly precipitation trends show increases in spring and
   summer, while they tend to decrease in autumn. Annual and monthly
   temperature trends show a greater variability spatial and temporal,
   where there are important annual variations because of the monthly
   changes; or there are monthly variations that are not yet reflected in
   an annual trend.},

   Statistical results showed that, in all Brazilian biomes, most of the
   evaluated sites did not show a significant trend in rainfall. However,
   the highest amounts of positive trends in average temperatures and
   insolation were observed during summer in the Amazonia, Cerrado and Mata
   Atlantica, while for rainfall, the highest amounts of trends were
   observed during winter in the Atlantic Forest. Negative trends were
   observed in insolation and average temperatures during winter,
   especially in the Mata Atlantica and Caatinga. It is assumed that these
   trends may be related to El Nino and La Nina events, as well as human

Abstract = {Background-The occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias seems to
   follow circadian, daily, and seasonal distributions. Our aim is to
   identify potential temporal patterns of electrical storm (ES), in which
   a cluster of ventricular tachycardias or ventricular fibrillation,
   negatively affects short-and long-term survival.
   Methods and Results-The TEMPEST study (Circannual Pattern and
   Temperature-Related Incidence of Electrical Storm) is a patient-level,
   pooled analysis of previously published data sets. Study selection
   criteria included diagnosis of ES, absence of acute coronary syndrome as
   the arrhythmic trigger, and =10 patients included. At the end of the
   selection and collection processes, 5 centers had the data set from
   their article pooled into the present registry. Temperature data and
   sunrise and sunset hours were retrieved from Weather Underground, the
   largest weather database available online. Total sample included 246
   patients presenting with ES (221 men; age: 65 +/- 9 years). Each ES
   episode included a median of 7 ventricular tachycardia/ventricular
   fibrillation episodes. Fifty-nine percent of patients experienced ES
   during daytime hours (P<0.001). The prevalence of ES was significantly
   higher during workdays, with Saturdays and Sundays registering the
   lowest rates of ES (10.4\% and 7.2\%, respectively, versus 16.5\% daily
   mean from Monday to Friday; P< 0.001). ES occurrence was significantly
   associated with increased monthly temperature range when compared with
   the month before (P=0.003).
   Conclusions-ES incidence is not homogenous over time but seems to have a
   clustered pattern, with a higher incidence during daytime hours and
   working days. ES is associated with an increase in monthly temperature
   variation.},

   products (ERA-40 and ERA-Interim) provide a generally consistent picture
   for tropospheric temperature trends over Armenia. The trends obtained
   from the three sources of data show significantly faster warming at the
   near-surface troposphere (at 850hPa) for the period 1979-2012 compared
   to 1961-1994. However, temperature trends at 850hPa are underestimated
   by the reanalysis products relative to the observed data. The warming
   rates decrease with height, and negative and nearly zero trends are
   observed in the middle and upper troposphere in most cases.},

Abstract = {The middle reaches of Yellow River is one of districts liable to severe
   drought in China, while the drought trend has become increasing recently
   as global climate change intensifying. In this study, standard
   precipitation index (SPI) was employed as drought index, and an improved
   SPI approach was proposed for better drought representation. The SPI
   degrees of ten - day series were calculated for Shanxi province located
   in the middle Yellow River for 40 years from 1970 to 2009. The results
   show the improved SPI could represent the historical drought situation
   of this district in a better manner. Allowing for the future drought
   trends impacted by climate change, the current widely used climate
   scenarios all over the world-four GCM (CSIRO, NCAR, MPI, PRECIS)
   projections during the 21st century under four IPCC SRES emission
   scenarios (Al B, A2, B1, B2)-were imported. The Delta change approach
   was employed to correct the systematic biases in GCM projections. The
   drought situations of Shanxi province during 2021 to 2050 were analyzed
   under future climate scenarios. Thus they were compared with the
   historical period from 1971 to 1999 in terms of inter - annual variation
   of drought level. The historical drought formation, development
   regularity and possible future situation were deduced. The results show
   under future climate change the drought would show the possibility of
   more critical against water supply and agriculture production. In view
   of the uncertainty of future climate change, though not very high
   possibility for more serious drought, it still should be paid more
   attention by water resources management.},

   temporal variability of precipitation at 45 districts of the Madhya
   Pradesh (MP), India over the period of 102 years (1901-2002) on annual
   and seasonal basis. Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator test
   were used to detect monotonic trend direction and magnitude of change
   over time on annual and seasonal basis. The cumulative deviations and
   Pettit-Mann-Whitney test were applied to detect possible change points.
   Change in percentage was discussed in terms of percentage change over
   mean. To explore the spatial distribution of trends, linear regression
   value of each station was interpolated using ArcGIS 9.3 on seasonal and
   annual basis. Mean annual precipitation varied from 694 mm (at
   Westnimar) to 1416 mm (at Mandla). Maximum decrease in annual
   precipitation was found at Balaghat (-11.99\%) and minimum at Shandol
   (-8.52\%) district The most probable year of change was 1978 in annual
   precipitation. Change in percentage in mean of 1901-1978 over the mean
   of 1979-2002 showed the decrease in precipitation in almost all the
   stations. Again, the decrease in annual precipitation was -2.59\% over
   the entire Madhya Pradesh in 102 years. West MP showed more increase in
   annual precipitation than East MP during the period of 1901-1978.
   However, the East MP showed more decrease than west MP during the period
   of 1979-2002. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We have performed trend studies in the mesosphere in the period
   1961-2009 with Leibniz-Institute Middle Atmosphere (LIMA) model driven
   by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis below
   approximately 40km and adapts temporal variations of CO2 and O-3
   according to observations. Temperatures in the mesosphere/lower
   thermosphere vary nonuniformly with time, mainly due to the influence of
   O-3. Here we analyze the contribution of varying concentrations of CO2
   and O-3 to the temperature trend in the mesosphere. It is important to
   distinguish between trends on pressure altitudes, z(p), and geometrical
   altitudes, z(geo), where the latter includes the effect of shrinking due
   to cooling at lower heights. For the period 1961-2009, temperature
   trends on geometrical and pressure altitudes can differ by as much as
   -0.9K/dec in the mesosphere. Temperature trends reach approximately
   -1.30.11K/dec at z(p)approximate to 60km and -1.80.18K/dec at
   z(geo)approximate to 70km, respectively. CO2 is the main driver of these
   trends in the mesosphere, whereas O-3 contributes approximately one
   third, both on geometrical and pressure heights. Depending on the time
   period chosen, linear temperature trends can vary substantially.
   Altitudes of pressure levels in the mesosphere decrease by up to several
   hundred meters. We have performed long-term runs with LIMA applying
   twentieth century reanalysis dating back to 1871. Again, trends are
   nonuniform with time. Since the late nineteenth century, temperatures in
   the mesosphere have dropped by approximately 5-7K on pressure altitudes
   and up to 10-12K on geometrical altitudes.},

Abstract = {Isolating long-term trend in sea surface temperature (SST) from El Nino
   southern oscillation (ENSO) variability is fundamental for climate
   studies. In the present study, trend-empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
   analysis, a robust space-time method for extracting trend patterns, is
   applied to isolate low-frequency variability from time series of SST
   anomalies for the 1982-2006 period. The first derived trend pattern
   reflects a systematic decrease in SST during the 25-year period in the
   equatorial Pacific and an increase in most of the global ocean. The
   second trend pattern reflects mainly ENSO variability in the Pacific
   Ocean. The examination of the contribution of these low-frequency modes
   to the globally averaged SST fluctuations indicates that they are able
   to account for most (>90\%) of the variability observed in global mean
   SST. Trend-EOFs perform better than conventional EOFs when the interest
   is on low-frequency rather than on maximum variance patterns,
   particularly for short time series such as the ones resulting from
   satellite retrievals. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Temperature trends are examined for a variety of locations in South
   Africa. The long-term mean annual temperature record (1885-1993) shows
   warming over the past century, with much of the warming occurring in the
   most recent three decades. However, our analyses show that half or more
   of this recent warming may be related to urban growth, and not to any
   widespread regional temperature increase. Maximum and minimum
   temperatures for the period 1960-1990 reveal a statistically significant
   decrease in the diurnal temperature range in large urban areas, but no
   change in the non-urban network. This assessment of the urban effects on
   temperature trends in South Africa may contribute to our understanding
   of apparent climate changes occurring in the Southern Hemisphere during

Abstract = {A review of several studies on the analysis of some long-term series is
   presented including rocket, lidar and satellite data. Despite the
   discontinuities due to the use of different type of sensors and
   corrections, rocketsondes, launched on a routine basis by the United
   States and Japan at several locations since 1969, have been re-analysed
   using a least square fitting method with a multi-parameter function.
   This model includes some linear functions to represent trends, natural
   cyclic variability (seasons, solar activity, equatorial QBO wind) and
   instrumental changes. Rayleigh lidar is also a well adapted instrument
   for monitoring absolute temperature in the middle atmosphere in a long
   term commitment. Lidar data obtained since 1979 in France (OHP) in the
   frame of the NDSC (Network of Detection of Stratospheric Changes) have
   also been analysed. Comparisons between lidar data and NCEP (National
   Center for Environmental Prediction) data interpolated from the global
   analyses to the lidar location reveal temperature differences. It
   appears that some bias caused by tidal influences is present in
   temperature series. (C) 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {Rainfall and temperature trends detection is vital for water resources
   management and decision support systems in agro-hydrology. This study
   assessed the historical (1983-2005) and future (2026-2100) rainfall,
   maximum temperature (T-max), and minimum temperature (T-min) trends of
   the Ziway Lake Basin (Ethiopia). The daily observed rainfall and
   temperature data at eleven stations were obtained from the National
   Meteorological Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia, while simulated historical and
   future climate data were obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project 5 (CMIP5) datasets under Representative Concentration Pathways
   (RCP) of 4.5 and 8.5. The CMIP5 datasets were statistically downscaled
   by using the climate model data for hydrologic modeling (CMhyd) tool and
   bias corrected using the distribution mapping method available in the
   CMhyd tool. The performance of simulated rainfall, T-max, and T-min of
   the CMIP5 models were statistically evaluated using observation datasets
   at eleven stations. The results showed that the selected CMIP5 models
   can reasonably simulate the monthly rainfall, T-max, and T-min at the
   majority of the stations. Modified Mann-Kendall trend test were applied
   to estimate the trends of annual rainfall, T-max, and T-min in the
   historical and future periods. We found that rainfall experienced no
   clear trends, while T-max, and T-min showed consistently significant
   increasing trends under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. However, the
   warming is expected to be greater under RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5 by the end
   of the 21st century, resulting in an increasing trend of T-max and T-min
   at all stations. The greatest warming occurred in the central part of
   the basin, with statistically significant increases largely seen by the
   end of the 21st century, which is expected to exacerbate the
   evapotranspiration demand of the area that could negatively affect the
   freshwater availability within the basin. This study increases our
   understanding of historic trends and projected future change effects on
   rainfall- and evapotranspiration-related climate variables, which can be
   used to inform adaptive water resource management strategies.},

Abstract = {Temperature records indicate that three of the four climatic stations
   evaluated in Mexico show warming over the years 1950 to 2013, as
   compared to the period 1961 to 1990 which was used as a baseline. After
   a complete analysis of climate records in Mexico, only 112 were
   determined to have met the quality and standards required for the
   present study. From those, a subset of 20 stations with a positive trend
   were randomly selected, which were representative of urban and rural
   areas distributed across Mexico. The mid 1970s was identified as the
   most recent period of intense warming, which is consistent with the mean
   global temperature indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change. A 10-year difference in the start of the warming period was
   found between rural and urban regions in Mexico. Warming and the
   difference between warm and cold periods are typically greater in urban
   areas than in rural areas.},

Abstract = {24 year of Meteosat hourly thermal infrared data have been used to study
   planetary surface temperature change. Thermal infrared radiation in the
   10.5-12.5mm spectral window is not affected by CO2 and only slightly by
   atmospheric water vapor. Satellite thermal infrared data have been
   converted to brightness temperatures as prescribed by Eumetsat. Hourly
   brightness temperature images were then composed to corresponding noon
   and midnight temperature data fields. The resulting data fields were
   cloud filtered using 10, 20 and 30 day maximum temperature substitution.
   Filtered data were subsequently averaged for two 10 yearly periods:
   1986-1995 and 1996-2005. Finally the change in brightness temperature
   was determined by subtraction. In addition nine locations were selected
   and data series were extracted and studied for the period 1982-2006. Our
   observations point to a decrease in planetary temperature over almost
   the entire hemisphere, most likely due to an increase of cloudiness. Two
   small areas are found where a considerable temperature increase has
   occurred. They are explained in terms of major human interventions in
   the hydrological balance at the earth surface.},

Abstract = {We examine the sensitivity of modeled and observed tropical tropospheric
   temperature trend amplification ( the ratio of T2LT ``lower
   troposphere'' to surface changes) to several sources of uncertainty.
   Model behaviour is robust across a large perturbed physics ensemble of
   HadCM3, yielding a smaller amplification range ( 1.44 +/- 0.06) than a
   previous multi- model ensemble ( 1.41 +/- 0.24). The uncertainty of
   inter- satellite calibration implied by available MSU T-2 ( mid-
   troposphere) estimates ( sigma = 0.035K) is much greater than that
   required to adequately resolve the trend ( sigma < 0.01K), or the
   amplification behaviour ( implied amplification range +/- 0.95). Trend
   amplification uncertainty in both models and observations decreases as
   the timescale increases. Depending upon choice of dataset and time
   period, uncertainty in trend amplification estimates over 21 years lies
   between +/- 1.5 and +/- 0.2.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the temporal variability of rainfall,
   temperature and extreme events over Jharkhand. The seasonal rainfall
   variability is examined for the period 1901 to 2018 and extreme rainfall
   events and temperature variability is examined for three stations
   (Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Daltonganj) for the period 1986 to 2018. To
   examine the temporal trend, a widely used non parametric Mann-Kendall
   test applied at 95\% confidence level. The trend analysis indicated that
   the seasonal rainfall significantly decreased for the study period at
   the rate of 13mm per decade over Jharkhand. The average annual maximum
   temperature shows significantly increasing trend at the rate of 0.58
   degrees C, 0.47 degrees C and 0.29 degrees C per decade at Ranchi,
   Jamshedpur and Daltonganj respectively. Similarly, the average annual
   minimum temperature also shows significantly increasing trend at the
   rate of 0.46 degrees C per decade at Ranchi and Jamshedpur and the
   increasing trend is 0.13 degrees C per decade for Daltonganj.The
   analysis reveals that the change in rainfall over the period of time is
   directly associated with number of rainy days, heavy rainy days and
   extreme rainfall events. The decreasing (increasing) trend of annual
   rainfall over Ranchi (Jamshedpur) is associated with decreasing
   (increasing) annual number of rainy days and heavy rainy days. No
   significant trend is observed in annual rainfall, extreme rainfall and
   heavy rainy days over Daltonganj. Result also shows that the increase in
   the temperature over the period is associated with the increase in
   number of heat wave days and decrease in cold wave days. All three
   stations have increasing trend of heat wave and severe heat wave and
   decreasing trend of cold wave and severe cold wave days.},

Abstract = {During the second half of the twentieth century, the Antarctic Surface
   Air Temperature (SAT) trends are characterized by fast warming over West
   Antarctica but mild cooling over East Antarctica. However, after 2000,
   the warming over several stations in the Antarctic Peninsula slowed
   down, whereas the South Pole experienced fast warming. These reversed
   SAT trends show strong regionality and seasonality, together with large
   uncertainty and disagreement among different observational and
   reanalysis datasets, which makes it difficult to achieve a comprehensive
   understanding of the multi-decadal Antarctic SAT trend and its reversal.
   In this study, we use the Combined Maximum Covariance Analysis (CMCA)
   method to extract the most coherent modes of the Antarctic SAT trends
   among six reanalysis datasets and 26 station-based observations. Further
   analysis shows that the reversals of the SAT trends before and after
   2000, especially for austral spring and summer, are mainly attributed to
   the reversed trends of the leading CMCA modes and their related
   atmospheric circulation and thermal advection patterns over Antarctica.
   For austral spring, the reversal of the west-warming-east-cooling
   pattern over Antarctica is closely related to the changes of thermal
   advection induced by the anomalous circulation center over the Antarctic
   Peninsula-Weddell Sea region. For summer, the post-2000 reversal of the
   Antarctic Peninsula-warming-East Antarctic-cooling is attributed to the
   stratospheric ozone recovery over the Antarctic, and the associated
   adjustment of the southern annular mode. The CMCA decomposition better
   combines the information from different measurements, clarifying the
   long-term SAT trend and its reversal for different seasons.},

Abstract = {Climate change has been the subject of intensive research in recent
   decades, with temperature being one of the key variables that helps to
   characterise the Earth's climate. This study analyses the main features
   and temperature trend recorded on the Mediterranean coast. Daily maximum
   and minimum temperatures recorded over 40 years (1965-2004) at 52
   stations spanning the coast of the Mediterranean Sea were examined for
   long-term trends. Four statistical indicators, namely, the median, the
   interquartile range, the Yule-Kendall index, and the robust kurtosis
   were calculated in order to group measuring stations that displayed
   similar features. The lowest recorded temperatures, around 15.8 and 7.5
   degrees C for the maximum and minimum, respectively, were reached on the
   Black Sea, whereas the highest recorded temperatures, 21.1 and 13.0
   degrees C, were obtained at low latitudes. Skewness was slightly
   positive at most stations. Moreover, temperature distributions were
   flatter than the Gaussian distribution. The final part of this study
   considers temperature trends using a harmonic model that yielded an
   increase of around 0.004, 0.023, and 0.039 degrees C year(-1) for the
   first, second, and third terciles, respectively, when considering
   maximum temperature, and slightly higher for the minimum temperature,
   0.010, 0.025, and 0.044 degrees C year(-1), respectively. The amplitude
   of the maximum and minimum temperature yearly cycle presented the
   highest value on the Black Sea, whereas the lowest was found at low
   latitude stations. Finally, annual amplitude trends ranged from 0.006 to
   0.027 degrees C year(-1) for maximum temperature and were slightly
   higher for minimum temperature, between 0.011 and 0.029 degrees C
   year(-1).},

Abstract = {Determining the rare of atmospheric warming in Antarctica is hampered by
   the brevity of the temperature records (<50 years), which still contain
   signals of decadal circulation variability in the Southern Hemisphere.
   In this note it is demonstrated that Antarctic warming trends have been
   regionally modified by slow circulation changes and associated changes
   in sea-ice cover: decadal weakening of the semiannual oscillation since
   the mid-1970s has limited the meridional heat exchange between
   Antarctica and its surroundings, so that warming trends have leveled out
   since then. In contrast, northerly circulation anomalies in combination
   with decreased sea-ice cover have regionally enhanced low-level warming,
   for instance in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula. Based on this
   knowledge, the authors propose a background Antarctic warming trend of
   1.30 +/- 0.38<degrees>C (century)(-1), representative of the period
   1957-95.},

Abstract = {The global climate has been experiencing significant warming at an
   unprecedented pace in the past century(1,2). This warming is spatially
   and temporally non-uniform, and one needs to understand its evolution to
   better evaluate its potential societal and economic impact. Here, the
   evolution of global land surface air temperature trend in the past
   century is diagnosed using the spatial-temporally multidimensional
   ensemble empirical mode decomposition method(3). We find that the
   noticeable warming (>0.5 K) started sporadically over the global land
   and accelerated until around 1980. Both the warming rate and spatial
   structure have changed little since. The fastest warming in recent
   decades (>0.4 K per decade) occurred in northern mid-latitudes. From a
   zonal average perspective, noticeable warming (>0.2 K since 1900) first
   took place in the subtropical and subpolar regions of the Northern
   Hemisphere, followed by subtropical warming in the Southern Hemisphere.
   The two bands of warming in the Northern Hemisphere expanded from 1950
   to 1985 and merged to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {An updated analysis of observed stratospheric temperature variability
   and trends is presented on the basis of satellite, radiosonde, and lidar
   observations. Satellite data include measurements from the series of
   NOAA operational instruments, including the Microwave Sounding Unit
   covering 1979-2007 and the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) covering
   1979-2005. Radiosonde results are compared for six different data sets,
   incorporating a variety of homogeneity adjustments to account for
   changes in instrumentation and observational practices. Temperature
   changes in the lower stratosphere show cooling of similar to 0.5
   K/decade over much of the globe for 1979-2007, with some differences in
   detail among the different radiosonde and satellite data sets.
   Substantially larger cooling trends are observed in the Antarctic lower
   stratosphere during spring and summer, in association with development
   of the Antarctic ozone hole. Trends in the lower stratosphere derived
   from radiosonde data are also analyzed for a longer record (back to
   1958); trends for the presatellite era (1958-1978) have a large range
   among the different homogenized data sets, implying large trend
   uncertainties. Trends in the middle and upper stratosphere have been
   derived from updated SSU data, taking into account changes in the SSU
   weighting functions due to observed atmospheric CO2 increases. The
   results show mean cooling of 0.5-1.5 K/decade during 1979-2005, with the
   greatest cooling in the upper stratosphere near 40-50 km. Temperature
   anomalies throughout the stratosphere were relatively constant during
   the decade 1995-2005. Long records of lidar temperature measurements at
   a few locations show reasonable agreement with SSU trends, although
   sampling uncertainties are large in the localized lidar measurements.
   Updated estimates of the solar cycle influence on stratospheric
   temperatures show a statistically significant signal in the tropics
   (similar to 30 degrees N-S), with an amplitude (solar maximum minus
   solar minimum) of similar to 0.5 K (lower stratosphere) to similar to
   1.0 K (upper stratosphere).},

Abstract = {Fever after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common phenomenon.
   However, the pattern of temperature change and its correlation with
   perioperative factors remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to
   define the trend of postoperative body temperature in patients
   undergoing TKA. This study also sought any factors influencing body
   temperature. We reviewed the charts of 186 clinically uncomplicated
   patients to record the changes of body temperature in the first 5
   postoperative days and to determine the factors affecting it. The
   temperature trends of patients with acute prosthetic infection were also
   reviewed for comparison. In uncomplicated patients, the average peak
   temperature was 37.9 degrees C, a 3.3\% increase from the preoperative
   baseline, 36.7 degrees C. The temperature elevation was most remarkable
   on postoperative days 1 and 2, but only 4 patients experienced fever up
   to 39 degrees C. Patients with lower hemoglobin loss showed higher peak
   temperature. Patients with postoperative infection tended to have
   prolonged fever and delayed presentation of peak temperature. Our study
   illustrated the elevated pattern of body temperature after uncomplicated
   TKA and determined the loss of hemoglobin might be the affecting factor.
   Fever up to 39 degrees C, prolonged fever, and delayed presentation of
   peak temperature were uncommon and should raise the clinical suspicion
   of infection or other complication.},

Abstract = {The trends of the sea surface temperature (SST) and SST fronts in the
   South China Sea (SCS) are analyzed during 2003-2017 using
   high-resolution satellite data. The linear trend of the basin averaged
   SST is 0.31 degrees C per decade, with the strongest warming identified
   in southeastern Vietnam. Although the rate of warming is comparable in
   summer and winter for the entire basin, the corresponding spatial
   patterns of the linear trend are substantially different between them.
   The SST trend to the west of the Luzon Strait is characterized by rapid
   warming in summer, exceeding approximately 0.6 degrees C per decade, but
   the trend is insignificant in winter. The strongest warming trend occurs
   in the southeast of Vietnam in winter, with much less pronounced warming
   in summer. A positive trend of SST fronts is identified for the coast of
   China and is associated with increasing wind stress. The increasing
   trend of SST fronts is also found in the east of Vietnam. Large-scale
   circulation, such as El Nino, can influence the trends of the SST and
   SST fronts. A significant correlation is found between the SST anomaly
   and Nino3.4 index, and the ENSO signal leads by eight months. The basin
   averaged SST linear trends increase after the El Nino event (2009-2010),
   which is, at least, due to the rapid warming rate causing by the
   enhanced northeasterly wind. Peaks of positive anomalous SST and
   negatively anomalous SST fronts are found to co-occur with the strong El
   Nino events.},

   increase in Maximum temperatures more than the Minimum temperatures and
   statistically significant at 95\% confidence level. A seasonal
   distinction is evident with the warming more in the Winter and Post
   Monsoon seasons as compared to the Pre Monsoon and Monsoon seasons at
   both the inter-annual and intra-seasonal scales of investigation. The
   seasonal distinction was also evident in the extreme temperature
   analysis. The frequency of occurrences in the hot days and hot nights
   were more pronounced in the Pre Monsoon and Monsoon seasons as compared
   to the Winter and Post Monsoon seasons. Symmetric warming trend was
   observed for both the daytime and nighttime temperatures at both the
   stations in all the seasons though the variations at Santacruz are
   statistically insignificant in the Post-Monsoon season.},

Abstract = {Trends and variations in global stratospheric temperatures are an
   integral part of the changes occurring in the Earth's climate system.
   Data sets for analyzing long-term (a decade and more) changes in the
   stratospheric temperatures consist of radiosonde, satellite, lidar, and
   rocketsonde measurements; meteorological analyses based on radiosonde
   and/or satellite data; and products based on assimilating observations
   using a general circulation model. Each of these contain varying degrees
   of uncertainties that influence the interpretation and significance of
   trends, We review the long-term trends from approximately the mid-1960s
   to the mid-1990s period. The stratosphere: has, in general, undergone
   considerable cooling over the past 3 decades. At northern midlatitudes
   the lower stratosphere (similar to 16-21 km) cooling over the 1979-1994
   period is strikingly coherent among the various data sets with regard to
   magnitude and statistical significance. A substantial cooling occurs in
   the polar lower stratosphere during winter-spring; however, there is a
   large dynamical variability in the northern polar region. The vertical
   profile of the annual-mean stratospheric temperature change in the
   northern midlatitudes over the 1979-1994 period is robust among the
   different data sets, with similar to0.75 K/decade cooling in the similar
   to 20- to 35-km region and increasing cooling above (e.g., similar to2.5
   K/decade at 50 km). Model investigations into the cause or causes of the
   observed temperature trends are also reviewed, Simulations based on the
   known changes in species' concentrations indicate that the depiction of
   lower stratospheric ozone is the major radiative factor in accounting
   for the 1979-1990 cooling trend in the global, annual-mean lower
   stratosphere (similar to0.5 to 0.6 K/decade), with a substantially
   lesser contribution by the well-mixed greenhouse gases. Ozone loss is
   also an important causal factor in the latitude-month pattern of the
   lower stratospheric cooling trend. Uncertainties arise due to incomplete
   knowledge of the vertical profile of ozone loss near the tropopause. In
   the middle and upper stratosphere, both well-mixed greenhouse gases and
   ozone changes contribute in an important manner to the cooling, but
   model simulations underestimate the observed decadal-scale trend. While
   there is a lack of reliable information on water vapor changes over the
   1980s decade, satellite measurements in the early to middle 1990s
   indicate increases in water vapor that could be a significant
   contributor to the cooling of the global lower stratosphere.},

Abstract = {Climate change resulting from the enhanced greenhouse effect is expected
   to have great impacts on hydrological cycle and consequently on
   ecosystems. The effects of climate variability have direct implications
   on water management, as water availability is related to changes in
   temperature and precipitation regimes. At the same time, this kind of
   alterations drives ecological impacts on flora and fauna. For these
   reasons, many studies have been carried out to investigate the existence
   of some tendency in temperature and/or precipitation series in different
   geographic domains. In order to verify the hypothesis of temperature
   increase in Sicily (Italy), temperature data from about 80 spatially
   distributed weather stations have been deeply analysed. In this study,
   trend of annual, seasonal and monthly temperature time series have been
   examined for the period 1924-2006 to investigate possible evidences of
   climate changes in this region. In addition, also a long series (more
   than 200years) has been analysed in order to individuate possible
   anomalies in the 20th century and to verify the presence, in the last
   decades, of a temperature increase larger than in the past. The
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric statistical test has been used to identify
   trends in temperature time series data. The test has been applied at
   local and regional scale for three different confidence level,
   considering the influence of serial correlation as well. The field
   significance of the regional results has been evaluated using a
   bootstrap technique of resampling that allows to eliminate the influence
   of data spatial correlation on Mann-Kendall test. The application of
   Mann-Kendall test on temperature data provides the evidence of a general
   warming in Sicily during the analysed period. The analysis of the long
   series demonstrates that the temperature trend is mainly due to the
   strong rising observed in the last years of the past century. In order
   to determine the spatial patterns of temperature trends and identify
   areas with a similar temperature evolution, the detected trends have
   been first subjected to the spatial auto correlation analysis and then
   interpolated using spatial analysis techniques in a GIS framework.
   Temperature trend maps have allowed to argue on the risk of aridity
   increase, in particular in the central and western part of the island.

Abstract = {Interpretation of the effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide
   on temperature is made more difficult by the fact that it is unclear
   whether sufficient global warming has taken place to allow a
   statistically significant finding of any upward trend in the temperature
   series. We add to the few existing statistical results by reporting
   tests for both deterministic and stochastic non-stationarity (trends) in
   time series of global average temperature. We conclude that the
   statistical evidence is sufficient to reject the hypothesis of a
   stochastic trend; however, there is evidence of a trend which could be
   approximated by a deterministic linear model.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Pages = {304-308},
Abstract = {A number of recent studies have examined trends in extreme temperature
   indices using a linear regression model based on ordinary least-squares.
   In this study, quantile regression was, for the first time, applied to
   examine the trends not only in the mean but also in all parts of the
   distribution of several extreme temperature indices in China for the
   period 1960-2008. For China as a whole, the slopes in almost all the
   quantiles of the distribution showed a notable increase in the numbers
   of warm days and warm nights, and a significant decrease in the number
   of cool nights. These changes became much faster as the quantile
   increased. However, although the number of cool days exhibited a
   significant decrease in the mean trend estimated by classical linear
   regression, there was no obvious trend in the upper and lower quantiles.
   This finding suggests that examining the trends in different parts of
   the distribution of the time-series is of great importance. The spatial
   distribution of the trend in the 90th quantile indicated that there was
   a pronounced increase in the numbers of warm days and warm nights, and a
   decrease in the number of cool nights for most of China, but especially
   in the northern and western parts of China, while there was no
   significant change for the number of cool days at almost all the
   stations.},

Abstract = {Autoignition temperature (AIT) data in the literature are frequently
   disparate and have high uncertainties. Examining the trend of AIT for
   chemical families that have well-defined homologous series can allow
   evaluation for internal consistency and provide phenomenological insight
   into the mechanisms that produce the observed trends, allowing engineers
   to better predict AIT for increasingly exotic compounds. The trend for
   the normal alkanes is well-studied and serves as a limiting case for
   other chemical families. A comprehensive examination of AIT trends for
   several chemical families reveals differences from the normal alkane
   family trend. AIT values from experimental measurements are presented
   and used, with literature values, to establish trends for several
   single-functional group chemical families, as well as propose and
   discuss phenomenological explanations for observed differences. Broader
   implications for these trends are also discussed along with best
   practices for evaluating and measuring AIT.},

Abstract = {On the basis of land station data from the Northern Hemisphere, it was
   determined that roughly half of the temporal variance of monthly mean
   hemispheric mean anomalies in surface air temperature during the period
   from 1900 through 1990 were linearly related to the amplitude of a
   distinctive spatial pattern in which the oceans are anomalously cold and
   the continents are anomalously warm poleward of 40 degrees north when
   the hemisphere is warm. Apart from an upward trend since 1975, to which
   El Nino has contributed, the amplitude time series associated with this
   pattern resembles seasonally dependent white noise. It is argued that
   the variability associated with this pattern is dynamically induced and
   is not necessarily an integral part of the fingerprint of global
   warming.},

Title = {Estimating Trends and Return Periods of Daily Extreme Precipitation
   Associated with Tropical Cyclones in the Core North American Monsoon},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2283-2292},
Abstract = {The largest number of tropical cyclones (TCs) is generated in the
   northeastern Pacific Basin. These storms can produce extreme
   precipitation (EP) in northwestern Mexico, causing loss of life and
   environmental damage. It is important to understand the dynamics that
   cause the EP associated with TCs, since most human activity requires
   planning to adjust to the dynamics of local climate changes. Therefore,
   in this work the goal was to estimate the trends and return periods of
   the average annual daily extreme precipitation (AADEP; 95th percentile,
   P95) in the June-September season in the core North American monsoon. To
   do this, daily precipitation data from 1961 to 2000 from 48 climate
   computing (CLICOM) weather stations located in the core of the North
   American monsoon were used to determine AADEP:
   1. Non-parametric trends with Mann-Kendall tests and Sen's slope
   estimator.
   2. Linear trends of annual averages of 95 (P95) and 99 (P99) percentiles
   with the least squares method.
   3. Return periods with the Gumbel frequency distribution function. The
   results disclose a significant upward trend in the intensity of P95
   increases in mountain stations, which may be related to a greater
   contribution of precipitation associated with TCs.
   The seasonal contribution of P95 in coastal stations and the total
   monsoon precipitation did not show statistical significance at alpha =
   0.05. The return periods of P95 associated and not associated with TC's
   from 2005 to 2500 were calculated. Return periods of P99 have been
   rising since 2010 and will continue to 2500. For P95 events associated
   with TCs, the anomalies are expressed with synoptic conditions of
   simultaneous positive anomalies in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
   (+PDO), negative anomalies in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
   (-AMO), weak La Nina in the eastern equatorial Pacific, positives in
   Caribbean Sea temperatures (SST>28.5 degrees C) and a strong land-sea
   thermal contrast in northwestern Mexico. The synoptic conditions were
   created two weeks before the start of TCs. This work sheds new light on
   the dynamics of return periods of EP and P95 trends associated with TCs,
   and on current and future simultaneity between anomalies of the +PDO and
   -AMO, which are essential characteristics for knowledge of TC for one of
   the regions most affected by these phenomena worldwide.},

Title = {Land cover and precipitation controls over long-term trends in carbon
   gains in the grassland biome of South America},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Carbon gains are a key aspect of ecosystem functioning since they
   represent the energy available for upper trophic levels. Carbon gains
   (or primary production) are strongly correlated with other ecosystem
   attributes such as secondary production and they are also the support
   for the provision of many ecosystem services. Given the documented
   dependency of primary production on precipitation, we expect that
   altered precipitation regimes, such as those projected by climate
   models, will have a significant impact on carbon gains. Land use and
   land cover changes are also expected to have a significant impact on the
   dynamics of carbon gains. We generated a spectral database of the
   fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by
   vegetation (fPAR), in order to study long-term trends (i.e., decades) in
   carbon gains and its spatial and temporal relationships with
   precipitation and land cover patterns in Uruguay, which is part of the
   Rio de la Plata Grasslands, one of the largest temperate grasslands
   biome of the world. We found that carbon gains of native forests and
   grassland afforestation exhibited the strongest positive spatial
   response to precipitation, whereas crops and rangelands the weakest. In
   addition, we found that the temporal response of carbon gains to
   precipitation was strong and positive for all land uses. Although there
   were not clear trends in precipitation, we found strong negative trends
   in carbon gains through time, particularly in rangelands of the
   ``Northern Campos'' of Uruguay, where these trends represent a decrease
   between 10\% and 25\% of the annual aboveground net primary production.
   On the other hand, positive trends in carbon gains through time were
   associated to grassland afforestation and native forests. Therefore,
   during the period analyzed, land cover had a stronger influence on the
   observed trends in carbon gains than precipitation. These patterns
   emerged as a consequence of the interaction among precipitation,
   temperature, edaphic factors and management. Present trends in the
   controlling factors of C gains would exacerbate the observed patterns
   with serious consequences for the provision of ecosystems services.},

Abstract = {Although present-day precipitation variability in the southern Altiplano
   and adjacent Andean margins (15-25 degrees S) is well understood, past
   drivers and mechanisms remain little-explored. We analyzed the pollen
   assemblages of 31 fossil rodent middens to reconstruct precipitation
   change during the most recent millennium in the highlands of the Atacama
   Desert (22 degrees S), on the western foothills of the Altiplano.
   Variations in low and high elevation pollen types reveal reduced
   (increased) precipitation between 930 and 550 BP (510 and 440 BP) (BP =
   before present; taken as Common Era 1950). Variable pollen assemblages
   prevailed from 390 to 90 BP, followed by a drying trend that persists
   until present times. Similarities with proxy records from the Altiplano,
   the tropical Andes and the equatorial Pacific suggest that
   centennial-scale wet/dry phases in the Atacama highlands were associated
   with changes in the strength of the South American monsoon system, most
   likely influenced by changes akin to modern El Nino Southern Oscillation
   variability.},

Abstract = {Precipitation, soils and soil water in a forested catchment in western
   Poland have been studied during the period 1992 - 96 (see also Vogt et
   al., this conf.). The S-deposition in the area during the study period
   was 2 - 3g S m(-2) yr(-1). In spite of decreasing anthropogenic
   emissions the S-deposition in the area did not change much during the
   study period mainly because the first years were exceptionally dry.
   However, the S-deposition was considerably higher during the previous
   decade. Based on soil water sulphate concentration, pH, acid
   neutralising capacity and the ratio of Al3+/(Ca2+ + Mg2+), there is
   apparently an amelioration in the conditions. A study using inter alia
   principal component analysis, indicates that this improvement is mainly
   due to more precipitation in the later part of the study period.
   Variations in precipitation amount have a pronounced effect on the
   soil-water chemistry, which makes it difficult to establish trends
   caused by changes in anthropogenic deposition. Long time series are
   therefore necessary to establish recovery due to reduced S-emissions.},

Abstract = {The daily precipitation data, from 1962 to 2012, of 20 relative
   meteorological stations in the Northern part of Haihe River Basin
   (NHHRB) were collected and analyzed to test the spatial variation and
   evolution trend of the extreme precipitation in NHHRB. Eight extreme
   precipitation indexes were selected and calculated to check the
   sustainability, frequency and intensity of the extreme precipitation in
   NHHRB and it is hoped to predict the characteristics or the likely types
   of precipitation causing disasters in the future. The results proved
   that: (1) the extreme precipitation happening in the plain area have the
   higher frequency and are more intensive than in mountainous area, and
   the extreme precipitation in coast area and the mountainous hinterland
   is of longer duration, while that in flat area and piedmont area are
   shorter, relatively; (2) through trend test, the sustainability in the
   flat area is examined to rise and the frequency and the intensity both
   have decreasing trend. In converse, in the mountain area and piedmont
   area, the sustainability of the extreme precipitation will re-duce, the
   moderate rain and rainstorm will happen less frequently while the heavy
   rain frequency is to rise, and the intensity strengthens. Therefore, it
   can be concluded that, due to the climate change, human activities and
   other factors, the characteristics of the extreme precipitation in NHHRB
   has changed. In the future, the flat area is more likely to suffer the
   disaster-causing precipitation with long sustainability, weak intensity
   and low frequency, and the mountain area will encounter with short-time,
   strong and frequent rainstorm.},

Abstract = {The temporal characteristics of annual volume-weighted average ammonium
   (NH4+) ion concentration in precipitation and local ammonia (NH3)
   emissions are investigated over the period 1982-1997 at National
   Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network site NC35,
   located in Sampson County, NC. Multiple regression analysis of annual
   volume-weighted average values of NH4+ concentration in precipitation
   identifies a statistically significant (p < 0.01) 4-year cycle and
   increasing trend during the period. The cycle is likely a function of
   mean annual ambient surface temperature, which is shown to be a
   significant (p < 0.01) predictor variable for annual NH4+ concentrations
   in precipitation. Loess fitting suggests that NH4+ concentration in
   precipitation began to increase more rapidly between 1989 and 1990. An
   analysis of estimated population-based annual NH3 emissions from
   individual sources in an intensively managed agricultural region
   surrounding NC35 shows that emissions from swine (p < 0.01), fertilizer
   (p < 0.10), turkeys (p < 0.05), and broilers (p < 0.05) are
   significantly greater during the period 1990-1997 than the period
   1982-1989. Emissions from non-broiler chickens are significantly (p <
   0.01) lower during the period 1990-1997. Cattle emissions are not
   significantly different (10\% level) during the two periods. The
   increase in average annual swine emissions between periods accounts for
   approximate to 84\% of the increase in average annual emissions from all
   sources between periods. Variability in local ammonia emissions from
   swine and mean ambient surface temperature explain approximately 90\% of
   the variation in annual volume-weighted average NH4+ concentrations in
   precipitation at NC35 during the period 1982-1997.},

Abstract = {Based on data from 1966 to 2018, the present study analyses
   precipitation trends in the Zohreh-Jirahi basin in Iran. The homogeneity
   of data was estimated based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method. Missing
   data were reconstructed using inverse distance weighted (IDW) and
   ordinary-linear-kriging methods. The results were evaluated by the root
   mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of
   determination (R-2). A multidimensional raster was generated containing
   precipitation values related to the statistical period years, and
   time-series data were produced in array format per unit area. Based on
   the period range, 34,267 points underwent the time-series analysis, and
   the trend change was assessed based on the Mann-Kendall method. The
   Sen's slope was evaluated using yearly and monthly scales in these
   points, followed by producing raster maps. The IDW was selected with an
   R-2 value of 0.95 as the optimal method of missing data reconstruction
   in this time period based on the model evaluation. The results showed no
   significant trends on a yearly scale, but on the monthly scale,
   December-April-November-August-September showed the highest ascending
   trends, respectively, February-December-March-May exhibited the highest
   descending trend, respectively, and June-July-September showed no
   trends. The maximum and minimum mean Sen's Slope were estimated for
   December (0.213) and February (-0.68), respectively. Water resources
   management is inevitable, particularly in the agricultural sector as the
   main consumer with macro socioeconomic dimensions. Given the notable
   impact of water supply time to optimise and increase productivity, the
   current study can contribute to revising the cultivation patterns and
   time in the region. The recharge of aquifers, the storage process, and
   the consumption process should be compatible with forthcoming changes.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed long-term extreme precipitation indices using 4 x 4
   km gridded data obtained from the National Meteorological Agency of
   Ethiopia between 1981 and 2018. The study examined trends in extreme
   precipitation over three districts (Lay Gayint, Tach Gayint, and Simada)
   in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. Innovative Trend Analysis
   (ITA) and Mann-Kendall (MK) trend tests were used to study extreme
   precipitation trends. Based on the ITA result, the calculated values of
   nine indices (90\% of the analyzed indices) showed significant
   increasing trends (p < 0.01) in Lay Gayint. In Tach Gayint, 70\% (seven
   indices) showed significantly increasing trends at p < 0.01. On the
   other hand, 60\% of the extreme indices showed significant downward
   trends (p < 0.01) in Simada. The MK test revealed that 30\% of the
   extreme indices had significantly increasing trends (p < 0.01) in Lay
   Gayint. In Tach Gayint, 30\% of the extreme indices showed significant
   increasing trends at p < 0.05, while 10\% of the extreme indices
   exhibited significant increasing trends at p < 0.01. In Simada, 20\% of
   the extreme indices showed significant increasing trends at p < 0.05.
   Overall, the results showed that the ITA method can identify a variety
   of significant trends that the MK test misses.},

Title = {Analysis of long-term precipitation changes in West Bengal, India: An
   approach to detect monotonic trends influenced by autocorrelations},
Journal = {DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {88},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The precipitation of the entire Indian sub-continent is primarily driven
   by the monsoon wind system, which throws a tough challenge to model
   changes due to its natural variabilities. Additionally, the unique
   geographical location and diverse climatic condition of the Indian state
   of West Bengal (WB) accelerates this challenge even more. Such a
   situation can be more complicated if the assumption of randomness in the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test is not taken care of. The present study inspects
   the dynamics of precipitation using the original MK test along with its
   three modified versions in WB. The modified versions are considered to
   incorporate all the significant autocorrelation coefficient (ACC) along
   with the short and long term persistence (STP and LTP) in the time
   series. Results showed that the presence of significant ACC was more
   common than the LTP behavior. The STP approach produced similar results
   to the original MK test, while the LTP approach reduced the number of
   significant trends. When the series was free from the scaling effect,
   consideration of all significant ACC gave better result in comparison to
   the STP approach. The annual precipitation is decreasing in large areas
   of WB, while the coastal areas are receiving increasing trends, which
   can intricate the estuarine and coastal processes. The Sub-Himalayan
   region and the western parts of WB are experiencing significant falling
   trend in monsoon season. Such a decreasing trend can enhance drought
   vulnerabilities, especially in the western parts of WB. However, the
   other three seasons (pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter) witness the
   maximum number of non-significant trends.},

Abstract = {A novel multi-timescale analysis method, Empirical Mode Decomposition
   (EMD), is used to diagnose the variation of the annual mean temperature
   data of the global, Northern Hemisphere (NH) and China from 1881 to
   2002. The results show that: (1) Temperature can be completely
   decomposed into four timescales quasi-periodic oscillations including an
   ENSO-like mode, a 6-8-year signal, a 20-year signal and a 60-year
   signal, as well as a trend. With each contributing ration of the
   quasi-periodicity discussed, the trend and the 60-year timescale
   oscillation of temperature variation are the most prominent. (2) It has
   been noticed that whether on century-scale or 60-year scales, the global
   temperature tends to descend in the coming 20 years. (3) On quasi
   60-year timescale, temperature abrupt changes in China precede those in
   the global and NH, which provides a denotation for global climate
   changes. Signs also show a drop in temperature in China on century scale
   in the next 20 years. (4) The dominant contribution of CO2 concentration
   to global temperature variation is the trend. However, its influence
   weight on global temperature variation accounts for no more than
   40.19\%, smaller than those of the natural climate changes on the rest
   four timescales. Despite the increasing trend in atmospheric CO2
   concentration, the patterns of 20-year and 60-year oscillation of global
   temperature are all in falling. Therefore, if CO2 concentration remains
   constant at present, the CO2 greenhouse effect will be deficient in
   counterchecking the natural cooling of global climate in the following
   20 years. Even though the CO2 greenhouse effect on global climate change
   is unsuspicious, it could have been excessively exaggerated. It is high
   time to re-consider the trend of global climate changes.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of
   greenhouse gas emissions, which have observably increased global
   temperature. Recognizing it as one of the most critical issues caused by
   human activities, this study investigates the effects of environmental,
   demographic, and economic indicators on global and regional temperature.
   For this purpose, advanced and powerful machine learning techniques,
   such as ANN, CNN, SVM, and LSTM, are employed using the data from 1980
   to 2018 of the aforementioned regions to predict and forecast global and
   regional temperatures in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South
   America. First, the predicted results were found very close to the
   actual surface temperature, confirming that environmental, economic, and
   demographic indicators are critical drivers of climate change. Second,
   this study forecasted global temperature from 2023 to 2050 and regional
   temperature from 2022 to 2050. The results also predicted a considerable
   increase in global temperature and regional temperature in the
   forthcoming years. Particularly, Asia and Africa may experience extreme
   weather in the future with an increase of more than 1.6 degrees C. Based
   on the findings of this study, the major implications have been that
   maintaining greenhouse gas emissions, balancing economic development,
   urbanization, and environmental quality while reducing fossil fuel
   energy consumption will ensure climate mitigation. The findings demand
   an alteration in human behavior regarding fossil fuel energy consumption
   to control greenhouse gas emissions, which is the most significant
   contributor to climate change.},

Title = {A statistical method for separating urban effect trends from observed
   temperature data and its application to Japanese temperature records},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {74},
Number = {5},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Separating the impact of urbanization (urban effect temperature trends)
   from observational data at urban monitoring sites is an important
   problem in the detection of global warming impacts. A statistical method
   using principal component analysis of the temperature data in an area
   was developed to separate the urban effect temperature trend from the
   observed temperature record at urban stations; including those without
   nearby rural reference stations. After the mathematical description of
   the method, an example of the analysis for model data on which some
   trends are superimposed (given) at any stations was shown for an
   explanation of the method. This example not only clarified the
   performance (impact, weight) of the superimposed trend in the trend for
   each principal component score (Z-score) but also showed how all the
   superimposed trends were separated from the model data by this method.
   This method was applied to monthly mean temperature data for the past 73
   years (1920-1992) from 51 meteorological stations in Japan, and the
   urban effect temperature trend at each station was separated from the
   observed temperature trend. As a result of the analysis, it was
   clarified that in Japan the maximum urban effect temperature trends at
   stations with a population of over 100 thousand in 1993 were 1.0-2.5
   degrees C/100 years, which were almost the same as those in the United
   States and China. The urban effect temperature trends in big cities are
   larger in the cold season than in the warm season, being maximum in
   winter or autumn and minimum in summer.
   After removing the urban effect temperature trend, the annual mean
   temperature trends at stations in Japan over the period analyzed ranged
   from 0.5 degrees C/100 years in northern Japan to 1.1 degrees C/100
   years in western Japan with the areal mean for Japan of 0.8 degrees
   C/100 years. The positive trends are most notable in winter and spring
   (December to May), and show areal mean values of 1.0-1.6 degrees C/100
   years with the maximum in March. On the other hand, they are not marked
   in summer and autumn. In particular, in the northern part of Japan,
   negative trends appear from July to November. The area with negative
   trends below -1.0 degrees C/100 years extends over most of the
   northeastern half of Japan in July, but does not reach the southern part
   of Japan, which has a slight positive trend. As a result of these
   regional differences in temperature trends, the north-south temperature
   gradient increases in summer and autumn with the maximum trend
   difference of 2.0 degrees C/100 years in July and October.},

Abstract = {Most probable temperature (MPT) is defined according to the skewed
   function by using daily average temperature records of the National
   Meteorological Information Center from 1961 to 2008 in China; it can
   represent every station's background temperature explicitly. MPT
   interannual variations show that M PT in summer was relativelly
   low-temperature-major before the mid-1990s and from then on was warming
   with fluctuation, but since 2005 the trend slowed down; and that MPT in
   winter was relatively low-temperature-major in 1961-1986, and from 1987
   to the beginning of the 21st century was warming up obviously, but since
   2000 the warming trend slowed down. The warming amplitude in winter was
   stronger than that in summer and the time of beginning of warming in
   winter was earlier than that in summer by about 5-10 years. Studying
   three climate states of MPT changes of 1961-1990, 1971-2000 and
   1981-2008, we found that in summer MPT got warmer obviously in the third
   climate state, while in winter in the second state. MPT warming trend
   was slowing down in the third state. It's worthy of note that in
   Sichuan, Guangdong and Guangxi MPT even began to decline in the last few
   years. Whether it means climatic transformation or not needs further
   research.},

Title = {Wave-Breaking Features of Blocking over Central Siberia and Its Impacts

Journal = {ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precipitation over southeastern Lake Baikal features a significant
   decreasing trend in July and August over 1979-2018 and is closely
   related to blocking occurrence over central Siberia (45 degrees-70
   degrees N, 75 degrees-115 degrees E). This study investigates the
   formation and maintenance of anticyclonic and cyclonic wave-breaking
   (AWB and CWB) blocking events and their climate impacts on precipitation
   in the southeastern Lake Baikal area. Both AWB and CWB blocking events
   are characterized by a cold trough deepening from the sub-Arctic region
   and a ridge amplifying toward its north over central Siberia, as well as
   an evident Rossby wave train over midlatitude Eurasia. For AWB blocking
   events, the ridge and trough pair tilts clockwise and the wave train
   exhibits a zonal distribution. In contrast, ridge and trough pair
   associated with CWB blocking events leans anticlockwise with
   larger-scale, meridional, and more anisotropic signatures. Moreover, the
   incoming Rossby wave energy associated with CWB blocking events is more
   evident than for AWB blocking events. Therefore, CWB blocking events are
   more persistent. AWB blocking events produce more extensive and
   persistent precipitation over the southeastern Lake Baikal area than CWB
   blocking events, in which moderate above-normal rainfall is seen in the
   decaying periods of blockings. A significant decreasing trend is found
   in terms of AWB blocking occurrence over central Siberia, which may
   contribute to the downward trend of precipitation over southeastern Lake
   Baikal.},

Abstract = {In this study, the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI)
   was applied to characterize the drought conditions in Southwest China
   from 1982-2012. The SPEI was calculated by precipitation and temperature
   data for various accumulation periods. Based on the SPEI, the
   multi-scale patterns, the trend, and the spatio-temporal extent of
   drought were evaluated, respectively. The results explicitly showed a
   drying trend of Southwest China. The mean SPEI values at five time
   scales all decreased significantly. Some moderate and severe droughts
   were captured after 2005 and the droughts were even getting aggravated.
   By examining the spatio-temporal extent, the aggravating condition of
   drought was further revealed. To investigate the performance of SPEI,
   correlation analysis was conducted between SPEI and two remotely sensed
   drought indices: Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) and Vegetation
   Condition Index (VCI). The comparison was also conducted with the
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The results showed that for both
   SMCI and VCI, the SPI and SPEI had approximate correlations with them.
   The SPEI could better monitor the soil moisture than the SPI in months
   with significant increase of temperature. The correlations between the
   VCI and SPI/SPEI were lower; nevertheless, the SPEI was slightly
   superior to the SPI.},

Title = {Recent surface temperature trends in the interior of East Antarctica
   from borehole firn temperature measurements and geophysical inverse
   methods},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {We use measured firn temperatures down to depths of 80 to 90 m at four
   locations in the interior of Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica to
   derive surface temperature histories spanning the past few decades using
   two different inverse methods. We find that the mean surface
   temperatures near the ice divide (the highest-elevation ridge of East
   Antarctic Ice Sheet) have increased approximately 1 to 1.5 K within the
   past similar to 50 years, although the onset and rate of this warming
   vary by site. Histories at two locations, NUS07-5 (78.65 degrees S,
   35.64 degrees E) and NUS07-7 (82.07 degrees S, 54.89 degrees E), suggest
   that the majority of this warming took place in the past one or two
   decades. Slight cooling to no change was indicated at one location,
   NUS08-5 (82.63 degrees S, 17.87 degrees E), off the divide near the
   Recovery Lakes region. In the most recent decade, inversion results
   indicate both cooler and warmer periods at different sites due to high
   interannual variability and relatively high resolution of the inverted
   surface temperature histories. The overall results of our analysis fit a
   pattern of recent climate trends emerging from several sources of the
   Antarctic temperature reconstructions: there is a contrast in surface
   temperature trends possibly related to altitude in this part of East
   Antarctica. Citation: Muto, A., T. A. Scambos, K. Steffen, A. G. Slater,

Title = {Temporospatial Distribution and Trends of Thunderstorm, Hail, Gale, and
   Heavy Precipitation Events over the Tibetan Plateau and Associated
   Mechanisms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {Temporospatial distribution and trends of thunderstorm, hail, gale, and
   heavy precipitation events over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) as well as the
   associated mechanisms with observational data from 1979 to 2016 are
   investigated, which have not been fully studied under a changing
   climate. The results indicate that thunderstorm, hail, and gale events
   over the whole TP show significant decreasing trends, while heavy
   precipitation events have an insignificant increasing trend. The
   southeast and central south subregions have obvious significant
   decreasing trends in thunderstorm, hail, and gale events, while the
   northeast subregion has a significant increasing trend in heavy
   precipitation events. It is found that the atmospheric circulation
   anomaly caused by the northwestern Atlantic sea surface temperature
   (SST) anomaly associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
   should be responsible for these changes. A strong wave train triggered
   by the northwestern Atlantic SST anomaly propagates from the northern
   Atlantic to East Asia through Europe, and induces a more upper-level
   warming over the TP and an anomalous anticyclonic circulation near the
   Lake Baikal, resulting in a more stable atmosphere and blocking effect,
   which forces the midlatitude westerlies and associated cold air to shift
   poleward. The weakened cold-air advection over the TP decreases the
   baroclinic instability and convection initiation, and finally causes the
   significant decreasing trends in severe weather events. On the other
   hand, the enhanced easterly winds in the southern flank of the
   anticyclonic circulation can significantly increase the water vapor flux
   from the eastern boundary of the TP and heavy precipitation events in
   the northeast subregion.},

Abstract = {Impact of future climate change on watershed-scale precipitation was
   investigated over Northern California based on future climate
   projections by means of the dynamical downscaling approach. Thirteen
   different future climate projection realizations from two general
   circulation models (GCMs: ECHAM5 and CCSM3) based on four emission
   scenarios (SRES A1B, A1FI, A2, and B1) were dynamically downscaled to
   9-km resolution grids over eight watersheds in Northern California for a
   period of 90 water years (2010-2100). Analysis of daily precipitation
   over the eight watersheds showed that precipitation values obtained from
   dynamical downscaling of the 1981 to 1999 control runs of ECHAM5 and
   CCSM3 GCMs compared well with the PRISM data. Long-term future trends of
   annual and seasonal basin-average precipitation were investigated.
   Although a large variability exists for the projected annual
   basin-average precipitation within each of the 13 individual
   realizations, there was no significant long-term trend over the eight
   study watersheds except for the downward trend in the A1FI scenario. On
   the other hand, significant upward and downward trends were detected in
   the seasonal basin-average precipitation except in the winter months
   (January, February, and March). The trend analysis results in this study
   indicated the importance of considering seasonal variability, scenario,
   and model uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Under condition of climate changes as global warming, monitoring and
   detecting trend of precipitation volume is essential and will be useful
   for agricultural sections. Considering the fact that there were not
   enough research related to precipitation volume, this study aimed to
   determine trends in precipitation volume, monthly and annually in
   different regions of Fars province for the last three decades (33 years
   period; 1978-2010). Fars province is located in arid and semi-arid
   regions of Iran, and it plays an important role in agricultural
   production. Inverse distance weighting interpolation method was used to
   provide precipitation data for all regions. To analyze the trends of
   precipitation volume, Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, and
   10-year moving average low-pass filter (within time series) were used.
   The negative trends were identified by the Sen's slope estimator as well
   as Mann-Kendall test. However, all the trends were insignificant at the
   surveyed confidence level (95\%). With regards to the application of
   10-year moving average low-pass filter, a considerable decreasing trend
   was observed after around year 1994. Since one of the most important
   restrictions in agricultural development of the Fars province is lack of
   sufficient water resources, any changes onward to lack of sufficient
   precipitation impose impressive pressure and stress on valuable
   resources and subsequently agricultural production.},

Number = {21},

Abstract = {An extreme-value analysis of projected changes in heavy precipitation is
   carried out for an ensemble of eight high-resolution regional climate
   model simulations over the European domain. The consideration of several
   regional climate models that are forced by different global models
   allows for an assessment of the robustness of the results in terms of
   intersimulation agreement. The extreme-value statistical method is based
   on a model that includes time-dependent parameters. Summer and winter
   are examined separately. This allows for identifying and sharpening the
   understanding of physical processes inducing the changes in
   precipitation characteristics. Thermodynamic aspects of changes in heavy
   precipitation are discussed. Variables that are related to the process
   of precipitation formation, such as precipitable water and cloud liquid
   water, are examined. In this context, the scaling of changes in heavy
   precipitation and other thermodynamic quantities with changes in
   temperature is explored. The validity of a Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of
   heavy precipitation is assessed on regional scales. Significant regional
   and seasonal differences in trends of heavy precipitation and only a
   limited validity of the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling are found. In winter,
   enhanced moisture transport and storm-track intensity lead to an
   increase in heavy precipitation, especially over the northern parts of
   the European continent. In summer, the increase of precipitable water is
   less than that required to maintain the same probability for saturation
   over southern Europe, which results in negative trends of heavy
   precipitation in these regions.},

Abstract = {Precipitation patterns during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the
   Rocky Mountains varied due to the influence of the continental ice
   sheets and pluvial lakes. However, no constraints have been placed on
   potential changes of southeasterly Gulf of Mexico-derived moisture that
   today contributes considerable precipitation to the easternmost ranges
   of the southern and middle Rocky Mountains. The Sangre de Cristo
   Mountains of southern Colorado are ideally situated to assess the
   relative importance of westerly and southeasterly-derived moisture
   during the LGM. Based on reconstructions of 30 palaeoglaciers in the
   Sangre de Cristo Mountains, we find that LGM equilibrium-line altitudes
   (ELAs) on the east side of the range were systematically 100-200 m lower
   than ELAs on the west side. The observed ELA pattern is strikingly
   similar to modern precipitation patterns in the study area, suggesting
   that southeasterly-derived precipitation had a significant influence on
   the mass balances of LGM glaciers.},

Abstract = {The observed trends in extreme precipitation events, and those in annual
   and seasonal mean precipitation in China during 1961 - 2001 are
   analyzed. The results show that the annual mean precipitation increases
   significantly in southwest, northwest, and east China, and decreases
   significantly in central, north and northeast China. The increasing
   trends in east China occurred mainly in summer, while the decreasing
   trends in central, north, and northeast China occurred in both spring
   and autumn. The increasing trends in most of northwest China occurred in
   all seasons. Patterns of the trends in extreme daily precipitation
   events are similar to those in the annual and seasonal mean
   precipitation except in the northwest China where most areas show
   increasing trends in extreme events only in summer. The extreme
   precipitation events in the Yangtze River basin increased dramatically
   by 10\% - 20\% every 10 years in summer, consistent with the increasing
   trends in summer mean precipitation in the region. The circulation over
   East Asia shows a weakening trend in the summer monsoon over central-
   east China.},

Title = {A weather-type approach to analyzing winter precipitation in France::
   Twentieth-century trends and the role of anthropogenic forcing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {21},
Number = {13},

Abstract = {The relationship between large-scale atmospheric circulation and
   November-March precipitation over France during the twentieth century is
   investigated. A long daily MSLP dataset is used to derive daily weather
   types that are discriminant for precipitation. A linear regression model
   is then used to relate the November-March-accumulated precipitation
   amount and the occurrence frequency of the weather types. This simple
   model shows that an important part of the interannual variability of
   precipitation is directly linked to large-scale circulation changes.
   Trends in observed precipitation and precipitation series reconstructed
   by regression are computed and compared. Spatially coherent trends in
   November-March precipitation during the second half of the twentieth
   century are observed, with an increase in the north and a decrease in
   the south. The spatial pattern of the trends in reconstructed
   precipitation is very similar to that observed, even if an
   underestimation of the positive trends in the north is seen, indicating
   that other mechanisms play a role. A detection study then leads to a
   better understanding of the respective roles of anthropogenic forcing (
   greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosol) and sea surface temperature in the
   evolution of the weather-type occurrence. Finally, it is shown that
   intratype dynamical variability has also played a role in precipitation
   changes in northern France, whereas no impact of temperature changes is
   seen.},

Title = {Frequency-intensity-distribution bias correction and trend analysis of
   high-resolution CMIP6 precipitation data over a tropical river basin},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {149},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {683-694},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Advancements in computational power have enabled general circulation
   models (GCMs) to simulate climate variables at a higher resolution.
   However, GCM outputs often deviate from the observed climatological data
   and therefore need bias correction (BC) before they are used for impact
   studies. While there are several BC methods, BCs considering frequency,
   intensity and distribution of rainfall are few. This study proposes a BC
   method which focuses on separately correcting the frequency, intensity
   and distribution of precipitation. This BC was performed on
   high-resolution daily precipitation simulations of Meteorological
   Research Institute-Atmospheric General Circulation Model Version 3.2
   with a 20-km grid size (MRI-AGCM3-2-S) model which is part of Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) on Netravati basin, a
   tropical river basin in India. The historical rain gauge station data
   was considered for testing the effectiveness of the BC method applied.
   The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, Taylor diagram, Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square
   error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), percentage bias (PBIAS) and
   correlation coefficient (R) are employed for the evaluation of the BC
   method. Higher R and R-2 and lower RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values were
   observed for the bias-corrected GCM data than raw simulation. The PBIAS
   reduced from 15.6 to 6\% when BC was applied. The analysis suggested
   that the proposed method effectively corrects the bias in rainfall over
   the basin. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to analyse the trend of
   historical and future rainfall in the basin. The analysis revealed a
   declining trend of precipitation in monsoon months with the magnitude of
   12.44 mm and 56.7 mm in the historical and future periods respectively.
   This study demonstrates that BC should be applied before the use of GCM
   simulated precipitation for any analysis or impact studies to improve
   the predictions.},

Title = {Evaluating long-term trends in annual precipitation: A temporal
   consistency analysis of ERA5 data in the Alps and Italy},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 22},
Abstract = {Reanalyses are utilized for calculating climatological trends due to
   their focus on temporal consistency. ERA5 reanalysis family has proven
   to be a valuable and widely used product for trend extraction. This
   study specifically examines long-term trends in total annual
   precipitation across two climatic hotspots: the Alps and Italy. It is
   acknowledged by reanalysis producers that variations in the
   observational systems used for data assimilation impact water cycle
   components like precipitation. This understanding highlights the need of
   assessing to what extent temporal variations in ERA5 precipitation
   amounts are solely a result of climate variations and the influence of
   changes in the observational system impacting simulation accuracy. Our
   research examines the differences between ERA5 and similar reanalyses
   against homogenized, trend-focused observational datasets. We find that
   discerning the climatological signal within ERA5 adjustments for
   observational system variations is challenging. The trend in ERA5 from
   1940 to 1970 shows distinct patterns over the Alps and, to a lesser
   extent, Italy, diverging from later ERA5 trends and those in other
   reanalyses. Notably, ERA5 shows an increasing, although nonlinear, trend
   in the deviation between ERA5 and the observational datasets. Improving
   future reanalysis interpretability could involve adopting a model-only
   integration for the same period, akin to the ERA-20C and ERA-20CM
   approach.},

Title = {Study of the precipitation trend of asphaltenes and waxes in crude oil
   using computational chemistry and statistical thermodynamics methods},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Asphaltenes aggregation and waxes in petroleum were simulated
   considering five molecular structures containing functional groups:
   asphaltenes, resins, and non-polar hydrocarbons in a heavy oil crude.
   The properties of molecules were calculated using the density functional
   theory. The van der Waals constants associated with the pairwise
   interactions and the Hamaker constants for the dispersed phase (formed
   by asphaltenes and waxes) and the dispersion medium (created by
   non-polar hydrocarbons) were estimated. Sparse pass size as a function
   of its composition is calculated using Qyle groups and the Young-Laplace
   equation. We also assessed the potential colloidal pair corresponding to
   the interactions between the asphaltene and resin aggregates for
   different dispersion media, the attractive energies between the
   asphaltene molecules (-60 10-20 J approximate to) are more than twice as
   high as the attractive energies concerning the rest of the molecules
   present ( x-30-10] 10-20 approximate to x J). It is predicted that
   attraction energy between the aggregates decreases with the increase of
   the presence of resin in the dispersed phase, This is explained by the
   fact that the increase in the concentration n of resin can lead to a
   decrease in the relative size d of the aggregates by up to 90 \% (for n
   = 0.1, d = 0.1 and for n = 0.9, d = 0.1). This decrease in aggregate
   size is manifested in a theoretically calculated effective viscosity
   reduction of up to 50 \%.},

Title = {The Roles of Precipitation Increases and Rural Land-Use Changes in
   Streamflow Trends in the Upper Mississippi River Basin},
Journal = {EARTH INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent trends in precipitation and streamflow in the United States have
   become a particular focus of hydroclimatic research. The U. S.
   Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN) has proven to be especially useful
   for the analysis of long-term streamflow trends. The U. S. Geological
   Survey (USGS) scientists selected sites for inclusion in the HCDN from
   the USGS stream-gauge network on the basis of streamflows being
   relatively free of nonclimatic anthropogenic influences. Consequently,
   most previous analyses of flow trends at those sites have either
   implicitly or explicitly attributed the trends to climate change and
   variability. In this paper, trends in seasonal and annual precipitation,
   and annual 7-day low, mean, and peak flows are examined for 48
   medium-sized HCDN streams in the upper Mississippi (UM) water-resource
   region over 1939-2008. Using the concept of precipitation elasticity of
   flow, it is shown that the observed magnitudes of statistically
   significant increases in mean and low flows were up to a factor of 3
   greater than expected from observed precipitation increases alone. Peak
   flows increased less than expected, and in the case of the Driftless
   Area at the center of the UM basin, decreased despite increased
   precipitation. It is proposed that the differences between expected and
   observed changes in streamflow can be explained by rural land-use
   changes in this principally agricultural region.},

Title = {Effects of the Trends in Spring Sensible Heating over the Tibetan
   Plateau during Different Stages on Precipitation in China},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {The spring sensible heating (SSH) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which
   can significantly affect the precipitation in China, has experienced
   three different stages of change, showing significant increasing
   (1961-1979, Stage I), decreasing (1980-2002, Stage II), and increasing
   (2003-2014, Stage III) trends. In this study, the impact of these
   different trends in TP SSH on spring precipitation (SPR) in China and
   their possible mechanisms are investigated, based on observations and
   the reanalysis product. In Stage I, the SPR represents a contrasting
   north-south pattern associated with the increasing TP SSH, showing
   increasing trends over southern China and decreasing trends over central
   and northern China. Further, the spatial distribution of SPR trends
   shows a contrasting east-west pattern in Stage II. That is, persistent
   weakening TP SSH plays a more crucial role in increasing and decreasing
   SPR over southwestern and southern China, respectively. However,
   compared with the significant trend in SPR in Stage III, the regulation
   of TP SSH on SPR weakens significantly. Dynamically, the increasing TP
   SSH in Stage I can strengthen the subtropical westerly jet in the upper
   layer, simultaneously configured with an anomalous cyclone in
   northeastern China, which deepens the East Asian trough. Thus, anomalous
   convergence in the upper layer occurs over central and northern China,
   favoring the downdraft. It then causes more cold and dry air to move
   southward in the lower troposphere, which then encounters the warm and
   wet southwest airflows, boosting the updraft over southern China. In
   Stage II, regression analysis shows that if the TP SSH increases, an
   anomalous cyclone in the middle and upper troposphere occurs over the
   western TP, causing the downdraft and less precipitation over
   southwestern China, while a cyclone in the lower troposphere occurs over
   the western North Pacific and extends to southern China, promoting the
   ascending motions and more precipitation in southern China. However, in
   this stage, TP SSH actually weakens, thus contributing to more
   precipitation over southwestern China and less precipitation over
   southern China.},

Abstract = {Global warming and the aerosol effect have both been proposed as
   possible causes of the changes in precipitation intensity (PI). Using
   daily data in Guangxi province, south China, during 1980-2008, the
   variation of different grades of precipitation was analysed and the
   possible causes are discussed. It was found that a declining trend
   occurs in low-grade precipitation and an increasing trend occurs in
   high-grade precipitation, which increases PI. However, the contribution
   from the increase in high-grade precipitation is offset by the decrease
   in low-grade precipitation, and thus total precipitation shows no
   significant trend. The relation between surface vapour pressure and PI
   was analysed to reveal the global warming effect on precipitation, and
   it was found that PI increases with increasing surface vapour pressure.
   In general, a difference between polluted and unpolluted areas was found
   in drizzle precipitation rather than small/medium/large/heavy
   precipitation; since drizzle precipitation makes little contribution to
   total precipitation and PI, it is concluded that global warming rather
   than the aerosol effect might be the primary cause of the increasing PI
   in the study area on a yearly timescale.},

Abstract = {An analysis of the frequency of cyclones and surface wind velocity for
   the Euro-Atlantic sector is performed by means of an objective
   methodology. Monthly and seasonal trends of cyclones and wind speed
   magnitude are computed and trends between 1960 and 2000 evaluated.
   Results reveal a significant frequency decrease (increase) in the
   western Mediterranean (Greenland and Scandinavia), particularly in
   December, February, and March. Seasonal and monthly analysis of wind
   magnitude trends shows similar spatial patterns. We show that these
   changes in the frequency of low-pressure centers and the associated wind
   patterns are partially responsible for trends in the significant height
   of waves. Throughout the extended winter months (October-March), regions
   with positive (negative) wind magnitude trends, of up to 5 cm/s/year,
   often correspond to regions of positive (negative) significant wave
   height trends. The cyclone and wind speed trends computed for
   January-March are well matched by the corresponding trends in
   significant wave height, with February being the month with the highest
   trends (negative south of lat 50 degrees N up to -3 cm/year, and
   positive up to 5 cm/year just north of Scotland). Trends in European
   precipitation are assessed using the Climatic Research Unit data set.
   The results of the assessment emphasize the link with the corresponding
   tendencies of cyclone frequencies. Finally, it is shown that these
   changes are associated, to a large extent, with the preferred phases of
   major large-scale atmospheric circulation modes, particularly with the
   North Atlantic Oscillation, the eastern Atlantic pattern, and the
   Scandinavian pattern.},

Abstract = {One of the most important scientific concerns of the last few decades is
   climate change, which is the result of a great many factors like global
   warming. Although a number of studies have been dedicated to understand
   the phenomenon of climate change, more attention is required to
   understand the potential effects of global warming on the ecosystems as
   well as on human life. The present study was designed to survey the
   trends of minimum, maximum and mean temperatures, relative humidity, and
   the time series of annual precipitation and 10-year moving average
   low-pass filter in the 13 synoptic weather stations of Iran's arid and
   semi-arid regions during the last 55 years by using tau Kendall test.
   The analyses indicate a significantly increasing trend for the minimum
   and mean temperatures while a decreasing trend for the mean relative
   humidity in the arid and semi-arid regions, especially during the last
   few years up to the year 2000. Any clear increasing or decreasing trend
   was not found for the maximum temperature, while the precipitation did
   not show any increasing/decreasing trend for most of the surveyed
   stations. Further studies, with long-term programming, are recommended
   to be carried out to evaluate the climate change and its effects on such
   regions.},

Abstract = {Long-term changes in the chemistry of precipitation (1978-94) and 16
   lakes (1982-94) were investigated in the Adirondack region of New York,
   USA. Time-series analysis showed that concentrations of SO42-, NO3.,
   NH4+ and basic cations have decreased in precipitation, resulting in
   increases in pH. A relatively uniform rate of decline in SO42-
   concentrations in lakes across the region (1.81 +/- 0.35 mu eq L(-1)
   yr(-1)) suggests that this change was due to decreases in atmospheric
   deposition. The decrease in lake SO42- was considerably less than the
   rate of decline anticipated from atmospheric deposition. This
   discrepancy may be due to release of previously deposited SO42- from
   soil, thereby delaying the recovery of lake water acidity. Despite the
   marked declines in concentrations of SO42- in Adirondack lakes, there
   has been no systematic increase in pH and ANC. The decline in SO42- has
   corresponded with a near stoichiometric decrease in concentrations of
   basic cations in low ANC lakes. A pattern of increasing NO3-
   concentrations that was evident in lakes across the region during the
   1980's has been followed by a period of lower concentrations. Currently
   there are no significant trends in NO3- concentrations in Adirondack
   lakes.},

Abstract = {The influence of sea-surface temperature (SST) on the lower troposphere
   and lower stratosphere temperature in the tropical, middle, and polar
   latitudes is studied for 1980-2019 based on the MERRA2, ERA5, and Met
   Office reanalysis data, and numerical modeling with a chemistry-climate
   model (CCM) of the lower and middle atmosphere. The variability of SST
   is analyzed according to Met Office and ERA5 data, while the variability
   of atmospheric temperature is investigated according to MERRA2 and ERA5
   data. Analysis of sea surface temperature trends based on reanalysis
   data revealed that a significant positive SST trend of about 0.1 degrees
   per decade is observed over the globe. In the middle latitudes of the
   Northern Hemisphere, the trend (about 0.2 degrees per decade) is 2 times
   higher than the global average, and 5 times higher than in the Southern
   Hemisphere (about 0.04 degrees per decade). At polar latitudes, opposite
   SST trends are observed in the Arctic (positive) and Antarctic
   (negative). The impact of the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon on
   the temperature of the lower and middle atmosphere in the middle and
   polar latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres is discussed.
   To assess the relative influence of SST, CO2, and other greenhouse
   gases' variability on the temperature of the lower troposphere and lower
   stratosphere, numerical calculations with a CCM were performed for
   several scenarios of accounting for the SST and carbon dioxide
   variability. The results of numerical experiments with a CCM
   demonstrated that the influence of SST prevails in the troposphere,
   while for the stratosphere, an increase in the CO2 content plays the
   most important role.},

Abstract = {Since the 1950s, precipitation has been measured at national weather
   stations in China using national stan-dard precipitation gauges. Gauges
   without a wind fence can significantly underestimate precipitation
   amounts, while this undercatch bias is closely related to surface wind
   speed and precipitation type. The observed surface wind speed across
   China has substantially declined during the past decades. Therefore,
   this study investigated the wind-induced error of the ob-served
   precipitation and its impact on regional and national mean trends in
   precipitation over China due to the reduction in sur -face wind speed.
   It was found that the wind-induced error for the mean annual
   precipitation nationwide was 29.28 mm yr-1, accounting for 3.92\% of
   total precipitation amount. The variation of precipitation at the
   regional scale was large but the trends were both positive and negative,
   approximately cancelling at the national level and resulting in a small
   national mean trend. The raw observation data showed that the national
   mean precipitation increased at a rate of 1.85 mm yr-1 (10 a)-1 from
   1960 to 2018, which was reduced to 0.33 mm yr-1 (10 a)-1 after
   correction, demonstrating that the correction of wind-induced error had
   an important impact on the trend of annual precipitation. Meanwhile, the
   reduction of surface wind speed was consistent at both the regional and
   national levels. On average, the wind-induced errors decreased at rates
   of-1.52,-1.34, and-0.14 mm yr-1 (10 a)-1 for total precipitation,
   rainfall, and snowfall, respectively. It illustrates that the decreases
   of the wind-induced error result in the increasing precipitation of raw
   observation.},

Title = {Changes in Extreme Precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau and Its

Abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau is among the region's most sensitive areas to global
   climate change. The observation data from 113 meteorological stations on
   the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions in China for 1971-2017 were
   used to analyze the periodic oscillations and trends in precipitation
   and extreme precipitation on multiple time scales to ensemble empirical
   mode decomposition. The relationship between extreme precipitation and
   sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies was also explored. The results
   were as follows. (1) The timing of extreme-precipitation events in the
   highlands is consistent, with increased total precipitation and
   increased frequency, intensity, and extreme values of extreme
   precipitation. (2) Changes in temperature and precipitation are not
   completely synchronized. The total extreme precipitation, number of
   extreme-precipitation days, maximum single-day precipitation, and
   extreme single-day precipitation intensity all showed increases with
   fluctuations; the quasi-3-year oscillation contributes the most to the
   extreme precipitation. PRCPTOT is most strongly correlated with R10 and
   R95p. (3) The spatiotemporal patterns of the first and second empirical
   orthogonal function modes of the indices differed significantly and were
   not spatiotemporally uniform, but exhibited local clustering. (4) The
   Indian Ocean Warm Pool Strength and Western Pacific Warm Pool Strength
   indices were most highly correlated with each extreme-precipitation
   index, and the timings of the extreme-precipitation events lagged behind
   those of the SST anomalies. This study improves our understanding of
   extreme precipitation events in the context of climate warming and
   provides a basic analysis for the further assessment and prediction of
   extreme precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding
   ecologically fragile areas.},

Abstract = {In this study, to evaluate the trend of precipitation change, the
   Mann-Kendall method has been used. The studied area is Lorestan province
   located in the western part of Iran. To achieve this goal, time series
   of annual and monthly rainfall data were collected for different
   statistical periods. Moreover, in order to analyze the drought, the
   standard precipitation index and the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test
   were used. To predict the meteorological drought in this province, the
   monthly time series of the precipitation parameter was incorporated. The
   results showed that most parts of Lorestan province are facing an
   extreme drought and such conditions will happen again in the future.
   Furthermore, the amount of precipitation was predicted until 2032, and
   the trend of predicted precipitation data in the entire Lorestan
   province showed that there is a significant trend in most months. The
   results of the research on an annual scale showed that all stations have
   a significant negative trend at the level of 5\%, which indicates the
   existence of a negative trend, or in other words, a decrease in
   irrigation in the studied stations. Therefore, according to the obtained
   results, it is necessary to plan the water consumption in Lorestan
   province toward sustainable management.},

Title = {Model Assessment of Observed Precipitation Trends over Land Regions:
   Detectable Human Influences and Possible Low Bias in Model Trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {31},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Precipitation trends for 1901-2010, 1951-2010, and 1981-2010 over
   relatively well-observed global land regions are assessed for detectable
   anthropogenic influences and for consistency with historical simulations
   from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The
   CMIP5 historical all-forcing runs are broadly consistent with the
   observed trend pattern (1901-2010), but with an apparent low trend bias
   tendency in the simulations. Despite this bias, observed and modeled
   trends are statistically consistent over 59\% of the analyzed area. Over
   20\% (9\%) of the analyzed area, increased (decreased) precipitation is
   partly attributable to anthropogenic forcing. These inferred
   human-induced changes include increases over regions of the
   north-central United States, southern Canada, Europe, and southern South
   America and decreases over parts of the Mediterranean region and
   northern tropical Africa. Trends for the shorter periods (1951-2010 and
   1981-2010) do not indicate a prominent low trend bias in themodels, as
   found for the 1901-2010 trends. An atmosphere-only model, forced with
   observed sea surface temperatures and other climate forcing agents, also
   underpredicts the observed precipitation increase in the Northern
   Hemisphere extratropics since 1901. The CMIP5 all-forcing ensemble's low
   bias in simulated trends since 1901 is a tentative finding that, if
   borne out in further studies, suggests that precipitation projections
   using these regions and models could overestimate future drought risk
   and underestimate future flooding risk, assuming all other factors
   equal.},

Abstract = {Long-term changes in the chemistry of precipitation (1978-94) and 16
   lakes (1982-94) were investigated in the Adirondack region of New York,
   USA. Time-series analysis showed that concentrations of SO42-, NO3-,
   NH4+ and basic cations have decreased in precipitation, resulting in
   increases in pH. A relatively uniform rate of decline in SO42-
   concentrations in lakes across the region (1.81+/-0.35 mu eq L-1 yr(-1))
   suggests that this change was due to decreases in atmospheric
   deposition. The decrease in lake SO42- was considerably less than the
   rate of decline anticipated from atmospheric deposition. Model
   calculations suggest that this discrepancy in watershed S budgets may be
   due either: 1) underestimates of dry deposition of S or 2) internal
   release of S from weathering or mineralization of organic S in soil. The
   discrepancy in watershed S budgets cannot be explained by the release of
   previously adsorbed SO42- from soil. Despite the marked declines in
   concentrations of SO42- in Adirondack lakes, there has been no
   systematic increase in pH and ANC. The decline in SO42- has corresponded
   with a near stoichiometric decrease in concentrations of basic cations
   in low ANC lakes. A pattern of increasing NO3- concentrations that was
   evident in lakes across the region during the 1980's has been followed
   by a period of lower concentrations. Currently there are no significant
   trends in NO3- concentrations in Adirondack lakes.},

Title = {Characterization of trends in reservoir storage, streamflow, and

Journal = {LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-79},
Abstract = {Dams and reservoirs were created on the Canadian River in New Mexico and
   Texas between 1918 and 1984 to supply water for irrigation and
   industrial and municipal uses; however, there are indications that the
   storage in the 4 major reservoirs is insufficient for current demand.
   This study was conducted to document changes in reservoir storage and
   streamflow throughout the watershed and to investigate the hypothesis
   that decreases in reservoir storage since 1990 were associated with
   changes in rainfall. Time-series analyses indicated that the reservoir
   storage values for all 4 major impoundments (Eagle Nest Lake, Conchas
   Lake, Ute Lake, and Lake Meredith) on the Canadian River in New Mexico
   and Texas during the decade of 2000-2009 were less than the historical
   means. Streamflows at all 4 USGS gauges on the Canadian River in New
   Mexico and Texas from 2000 to 2009 were less than the long-term mean
   flows. Mean annual precipitation from 36 weather stations either in or
   adjoining the watershed tended to be lower from 2001 to 2010 than the
   period from 1971 to 2000. The frequency of rainfall events in excess of
   50 mm from a weighing rain gauge at Bushland, Texas, from 2000 to 2009
   was different from that reported from 1960 to 1979. ArcSWAT, a
   hydrological model, was able to simulate the observed declines in
   storage in Lake Meredith from 1990 to 2009 using historical rainfall
   data. These results support the hypothesis that the decreases in storage
   in Lake Meredith were associated with changes in rainfall.},

Title = {A Persistently Increasing Precipitation Trend Through the Holocene in

   Lake},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Precipitation is an important requirement for the stable and sustainable
   development of ecosystems and communities in arid areas, which are
   vulnerable to the influences of climate change. The changes in
   precipitation throughout the Holocene, as well as its long-term
   characteristics in arid northwest China, are not well understood, and
   records to reconstruct the precipitation trends are needed. Therefore,
   this study established a well-dated black carbon (BC) stable
   isotope-inferred (delta C-13) precipitation record based on a sediment
   core from Sayram Lake, Tianshan Mountains (Xinjiang province, northwest
   China). The record spans the last 12880 cal. yr BP. Variations in BC
   delta C-13 showed that between similar to 12280 and 9260 cal. yr BP,
   regional precipitation gradually decreased, but then increased
   continually until the present, with millennial to centennial scale
   fluctuations. During the Holocene, a distinct period of low
   precipitation was observed between 9800 and 8800 cal. yr BP, and two
   episodes of high precipitation were observed between 8000 and 7600, and
   5800 and 2500 cal. yr BP. The maximum precipitation occurred at similar
   to 3800 cal. yr BP. Generally, the persistently increasing precipitation
   trend is consistent with other records from arid northwest China and
   adjacent areas. The trend was possibly controlled by Northern Hemisphere
   solar insolation and associated substantial ice sheet remnants, due to
   the influence of the North Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures and
   intensities of the Westerlies, which regulate the transport of water
   vapor to Xinjiang. The results provide a better understanding of the
   mechanisms driving the evolution of precipitation through the Holocene.},

Title = {Trend Analysis of Seasonal Precipitation (1960-2013) in Subregions of

Abstract = {In this study, trends of seasonal precipitation are investigated in
   subregions of Hunan Province in China over 1960-2013 by discrete wavelet
   transform (DWT) and Mann-Kendall (MK) tests. The main purpose of trend
   analysis is to detect the most dominant periodic components affecting
   the observed trends of seasonal precipitation in each subregion. For
   this purpose, the homogeneous precipitation regions are first delineated
   by combining rotated empirical orthogonal functions with agglomerative
   hierarchical clustering. Results suggest dividing the precipitation of
   Hunan Province into five subregions for winter and three subregions for
   spring, summer, and autumn. Delineated subregions for each season show
   strongly coherent spatial patterns, all of which are along the strip
   extending in the southwest-northeast direction. After regionalization,
   areal seasonal precipitation series in each subregion are decomposed
   into several detail and approximation component subseries, and then the
   decomposed subseries are analyzed by three types of MK tests. Results
   reveal that winter and summer precipitations experience an increasing
   trend in all of the divisions-winter precipitation in southeast-central
   and southern Hunan and summer precipitation in southwest-central Hunan
   especially exhibit a statistically significant tendency. However, spring
   and autumn precipitations show a nonsignificant decreasing trend in all
   of the divisions. Results from DWT and sequential MK analyses suggest
   that detail component 1 (plus approximation) of seasonal precipitations
   in all subregions is the most dominant periodic mode affecting their
   observed trends, except for summer precipitation in the subregion of
   southern Hunan, where detail component 2 is the most dominant one.
   Therefore, short-term periodicity (2-4 yr) is the most influential in
   affecting the observed trends of seasonal precipitation over Hunan
   Province.},

Abstract = {One of the approaches usedtoinvestigate trend step changes in
   precipitation isstatistical techniques. The main objective ofthis paper
   is toidentify and analyze thetrend ofchanges in annual and
   seasonalprecipitation overthe studied area. The current study employs
   monthly precipitation data from 1951 to 2010 derived from a weather
   station in Kermanshah. Using non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and
   graphic based methods depicting total annual and seasonal (cold and warm
   seasons) precipitation, the research analyzes trend changes of
   Kermanshah over different time series. Primarily, data changes in
   studied seasons and years are analyzed. Then, type and time of these
   changes are identified. Averages of monthly precipitation overKermanshah
   during warm and cold seasons are determined as 47.9 +/- 33.64 Mm and
   169.68 +/- 54.56 Mm, respectively. There is no significant trend in
   annual precipitation over Kermanshah. Analysis of averages precipitation
   of warm and cold seasons indicates no significant trend; however, warm
   season seems to follow a decreasing trend in general. Yet, there are
   leaps in the average levels of both annual and seasonal precipitation.
   The obtained results show that general trend of change in average
   precipitation during warm seasons is downward with leaps of average
   during the studied period. But, in general, there is no significant
   trend of change in the averages of annual and seasonal precipitation
   during the studied time.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Variability and Trends of Extreme Precipitation in the
   Huaihe River Basin, a Climatic Transitional Zone in East China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {Precipitation data from 30 stations in the Huaihe River basin (HRB), a
   climatic transitional zone in east China, were used to investigate the
   spatiotemporal variability and trends of extreme precipitation on
   multitimescales for the period 1961-2010. Results indicated that (1) the
   spatial pattern of the annual precipitation, rainy days, extreme
   precipitation, and maximum daily precipitations shows a clear
   transitional change from the south (high) to the north (low) in the HR;
   it confirmed the conclusion that the HRB is located in the transitional
   zone of the 800 mm precipitation contour in China, where the 800 mm
   precipitation contour is considered as the geographical boundary of the
   south and the north. (2) Higher value of the extreme precipitation
   intensity mainly occurs in the middle of the east and the central part
   of the basin; it reveals a relatively distinct west-east spatial
   disparity, and this is not in line with the spatial pattern of the
   extreme precipitation total, the sum of the precipitation in 95th
   precipitation days. (3) Annual precipitation of 22 stations exhibits
   increasing trend, and these 22 stations are located from the central to
   the northern part. There is no significant trend detected for the
   seasonal precipitation. The summer precipitation exhibits a larger
   change range; this might cause the variation of the flood and drought in
   the HBR. However, the increasing trend in winter precipitation may be
   beneficial to the relief of winter agricultural drought. Rainy days in
   12 stations, mostly located in and around the central northeastern part,
   experienced significant decreasing trend. Extreme precipitation days and
   precipitation intensity have increasing trends, but no station with
   significant change trend is detected for the maximum precipitation of
   the basin. (4) The spatiotemporal variability in the HRB is mainly
   caused by the geographic differences and is largely influenced by the
   interdecadal variations of East Asian Summer Monsoon in eastern China.
   The output of this paper could provide references for the practical
   decision making and integrated basin management of Huaihe River basin.},

Title = {An investigation into trends in frequency and proportion of different

Journal = {METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climate change can be traced in any given region by searching for
   changes in climatic elements' characteristics. Extreme precipitation,
   for example, is a characteristic of precipitation whose changes,
   especially in recent years, can be attributed to global warming and
   climate change. This study aimed to investigate possible changes in
   extreme precipitation in Iran by analysing the frequency of extreme
   rainy days duration. To this end, gridded precipitation datasets from
   the hydrological years 1971-1972 to 2015-2016 were used, and days
   associated with extreme precipitation were extracted by using thresholds
   of 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles (as heavy, very heavy, and extremely
   heavy precipitation, respectively). Latitude and longitude showed the
   most significant correlation with precipitation characteristics in the
   spatial distribution during the study period. In addition, heavy (HP),
   very heavy, and extremely heavy precipitation experienced durations of
   1-8, 1-7, and 1-4 days, respectively. At all extremes, the 1-day
   duration covered more areas and had more repetition, while the longer
   duration had the lowest tempo-spatial repetition. According to the
   results of the present study, the one-day duration of HP contributed
   more significantly to the annual precipitation. The proportion of this
   type of precipitation has been more significant in the southern and
   central regions of the country. Furthermore, it was revealed that the
   frequency of durations of short-term HP increased during the study
   period, whereas the duration of long-term HP declined.},

Abstract = {Reliable information on the frequency and duration of excessive
   precipitation in floods, droughts, earthquakes, coastal floods, and hill
   torrents is critical to natural disaster planning and disaster risk
   reduction strategies. The current study examined precipitation on a
   monthly, seasonal, and annual scale at varying amplitudes. Moreover, the
   Mann-Kendall and Sen Innovatiove trend analysis (ITA) approaches are
   used to examine precipitation variations. This study aims to evaluate
   the Mann-Kendall and Sen Innovative Trend Analysis techniques to
   understand better how they apply to the topic under consideration.
   Overall, 84.16\% of testing months showed trendless precipitation based
   on the MK trend test. Comparatively, the ITA monthly analysis showed
   statistically significant variation in 80\% months and 88\% considerable
   rate in seasonal perspective over the entire study regions. The research
   recognized that the Sen Innovative trend test outperforms the
   Mann-Kendall analysis in a range of circumstances. First of all, Sen
   Approach has simple assumptions, and the study of skewed distributions
   with fewer data could apply. Another benefit of using the ITA was that
   all data sets could be viewed on a graph, making it easier to see
   patterns and interpret the trends. Thus, the research recommends that
   the Sen Trend Method (ITA) analyze monthly, seasonal, and annual
   precipitation patterns to facilitate water resource scheduling and
   establish natural disaster strategies in the future.},

Title = {Regionally Different Precipitation Trends Over the Tibetan Plateau in
   the Warming Context: A Perspective of the Tibetan Plateau Vortices},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) significantly affects both
   the local ecology and the downstream water resources. In this study, it
   is found that there exists an increasing precipitation trend over the
   northern TP but not in the southern TP, which is interpreted from the
   perspective of the activities of Tibetan Plateau vortices (TPVs). In the
   context of recent warming over the TP, the increasing rate of genesis
   frequency of TPVs over the northern TP is remarkably larger than that
   over the southern TP, which is responsible for different precipitation
   trends in the northern and southern TP, respectively. That is, the most
   significant warming over the TP appears in the upper troposphere, which
   intensifies the 200 hPa westerly jet north of the TP, hereby produces
   more favorable conditions for the genesis of TPVs over the northern TP
   than over southern TP, and contributes to regional difference in
   precipitation trends.
   Plain Language Summary Precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP)
   significantly affects the local ecology and the downstream water
   resources. In recent decades, significant warming trend is observed over
   the TP. It is found that the precipitation trends over the TP show
   robust regional differences in the warming context, with the causal
   physical process being not yet clear. Given the Tibetan Plateau vortices
   (TPVs) are important rainfall triggers over the TP, the regionally
   different precipitation trends over the TP are interpreted from the
   perspective of TPVs. Here, we show that warming over the TP causes
   regionally different increases in the genesis frequency of TPVs by
   modulating the upper-level westerly jet, and hereby contributes to the
   regional difference in precipitation trends over the TP.},

Abstract = {Drought is one of the major agricultural and meteorological disasters in
   China that occurs at high frequency, affects wide areas, and causes
   considerable agricultural loss. Research on the long-term spatiotemporal
   variability of arid climate and drought area in the context of global
   climate change is important and practically significant to the intention
   to cope with drought. Standardized precipitation index (SPI) was
   calculated using long-term monthly data of surface precipitation with
   0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution at 12-month timescales. The
   capacity of the SPI index to describe arid climate was verified using
   three drought cases that occurred in Southern China in the early 2000s.
   The spatiotemporal variability of China's arid climate and drought area
   from the perspective of meteorological drought was analyzed. All
   categories of drought (i. e., mild, moderate, severe, and extreme)
   exhibited slight downward trend in terms of drought area, but variation
   was observed from region to region. Over the past 50 years, Southwest
   and Northeast China experienced more arid, while Southeast and Northwest
   China experienced the opposite.},

Abstract = {Recently, the incidence of heavy rainfall events and associated flash
   floods have encouraged us to investigate long-term trends in extreme
   rainfall and flash flood vulnerability mapping. Thus, in this study, a
   hybrid model was designed by integrating weight of evidence and Naive
   Bayes (WOE-NB) to identify areas in Uttarakhand prone to flash floods,
   and we compared its ability with that of AdaBoost. Furthermore, the
   significance of long-term rainfall trends was evaluated using
   Mann-Kendall, modified Mann-Kendall, and innovative trend analysis
   (ITA), and extreme rainfall events were examined for 51 years
   (1970-2020). Results showed the WOE-NB and AdaBoost had acceptable
   goodness of fit (area under the curve = 0.969 and 0.973, respectively).
   Moreover, ITA can identify some important patterns based on on-trend
   results that other tests cannot. The return period revealed about
   97.54\% of the flash floods were caused by normal rainfall, with 2.45\%
   being caused by severely abnormal rainfall.},

Abstract = {Climate change has a greater impact on high-altitude and mountain
   regions than on lowlands. The first priority should be to detect these
   changes in high mountainous regions, as they will directly affect water
   resources in the main stems. The present study examines the effect of
   climate change on snow-rain phase separation in the future in the
   Behesht Abad and Koohrang zones of Iran's central Zagros mountains, one
   of the country's highest mountain ranges. The study region's 1985-2019
   precipitation, temperature, and precipitation type data were used for
   this purpose. Future climate change was predicted using the National
   Center for Environmental Protection's (NCEP) atmospheric reanalysis data
   and the CanESM2 model for the three scenarios RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP
   8.5. Furthermore, the SDSM 5.3 model was used to perform the
   downscaling. The original and modified Mann-Kendall tests were used to
   detect data trends. Different methods were investigated, and
   observational reports were compared to separate the precipitation phase
   during the basic period, and in conclusion, the methods Kienzle and USCE
   yielded good results. According to the findings of this study, climate
   change will cause significant changes in the temperature distribution of
   precipitation in the studied mountain region in the future. The
   probability of extreme precipitation will increase along with a decrease
   in precipitation rate variability relative to the historical period
   during the fall-winter season. Additionally, the changes will increase
   precipitation during warmer temperatures and decrease it during periods
   of cooler temperatures and change in snow and rain rates in the future,
   relative to the historical period.},

Title = {A synoptic view of trends and decadal variations in autumn precipitation

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {114},

Abstract = {Precipitation and streamflow have increased in United States since 1948
   with the largest increases generally observed in the Midwest and in the
   autumn. Autumn precipitation in the central United States also exhibits
   spatially correlated decadal-scale variability with a period of
   approximately 12 years. In this study, we identify synoptic circulation
   patterns from daily atmospheric data conducive for precipitation
   anomalies in the central United States and link changes in the frequency
   of these patterns to the observed trends and decadal variations in
   autumn precipitation over the central United States. A synoptic air-mass
   classification approach based on classification and regression trees is
   applied to daily NCAR-NCEP Reanalysis data to identify synoptic
   circulation patterns associated with changing air-mass characteristics
   and developing surface weather systems in the central United States. The
   advantage of the proposed approach is that precipitation data are not
   used to identify recurring synoptic patterns over North America. The
   analysis identifies four daily circulation types conducive to spatially
   correlated precipitation anomalies across the central United States. The
   frequency of these circulation types is then linked to the observed
   trends and decadal variations in autumn precipitation over the central
   United States. Our analysis suggests that the trends and decadal
   variations in autumn precipitation are related to an increase (
   decrease) in the frequency of days with a trough ( ridge) over the
   western United States. The effect of this change in circulation on the
   occurrence of intense precipitation is discussed.},

Abstract = {Studies of temperature and rainfall long-term variability in the context
   of climate change are important, particularly in regions where rainfed
   agriculture is predominant. Long-term trends of temperature and rainfall
   have been determined for Kolkata, India (a tropical region) using
   gridded monthly data from the Global Precipitation and Climate Centre
   (GPCC v. 7) with 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution for the period
   1901 to 2014. Precipitation concentration index, coefficient of
   variation, and rainfall anomaly have been calculated and Palmer drought
   severity index has been analyzed. Furthermore, the Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's slope estimate have been used to detect time series trend. Annual
   temperature and rainfall have increased at a rate of 0.0082 degrees C
   yr-1 and 0.03 mm yr-1, respectively. Most months show statistically
   significant increasing trends for temperature and rainfall. Rainfall
   with high precipitation concentration index (16-20) has been observed
   for the period 1951-1975 and 1976-2000. The number of years with dry
   conditions has increased. However, the intensity of dryness is very
   close to zero. The information from this study will be helpful for
   farmers to plan for resilient farming.},

   of Temperature and Rainfall},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Bangladesh has been experiencing increased temperature and change in
   precipitation regime, which might adversely affect the important
   ecosystems in the country differentially. The river flows and
   groundwater recharge over space and time are determined by changes in
   temperature, evaporation and crucially precipitation. These again have a
   spatio-temporal dimension. This geospatial modeling research aimed at
   investigating spatial patterns and changing trends of temperature and
   rainfall within the geographical boundary of Bangladesh. This would
   facilitate better understanding the change pattern and their probable
   impacts on the ecosystem. The southeastern region, which is one of the
   most important forest ecosystem zones in the country, is experiencing
   early onset and withdrawal of rain but increasing trends in total
   rainfall except in the Monsoon season. This means that the region is
   experiencing a lower number of rainy days. However, total rainfall has
   not changed significantly. The differential between maximum and minimum
   showed an increasing trend. This changing pattern in average max and min
   temperature along with precipitation might cause a situation in which
   the species that are growing now may shift to suitable habitats
   elsewhere in the future. Consequently, the biodiversity, watersheds and
   fisheries, productivity of land, agriculture and food security in the
   region will be affected by these observed changes in climate.},

Abstract = {Understanding local-scale climate change is vital to developing adaptive
   strategies in the face of the century-old river of global warming posing
   a threat to humanity. This study focuses on assessing temperature and
   rainfall trends in Beni City, using monthly and yearly (1990-2020)
   weather station data. Climate variability was analysed using the
   standardised variable index, and rainfall concentration patterns were
   highlighted using the precipitation concentration index (PCI). The
   climate trends were analysed by using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's
   slope estimator. The findings indicated that the T-min is 18.82 +/- 0.62
   degrees C, and Tmax is 28.22 +/- 0.75 degrees C, resulting in a mean
   temperature of 23.52 +/- 0.57 degrees C. The annual and seasonal
   temperature trend analysis indicated that a significant warming trend
   was observed in both T-min and T-max. Beni City's precipitation trends
   also showed a mean annual rainfall of 1988.38 +/- 416.59 mm, with
   significant year-to-year variations. Annual rainfall analysis exhibited
   a slight upward trend; meanwhile, the seasonal trend analysis revealed
   an increase in rainfall during Mar-Apr-May (MAM) and Aug-Sep-Oct-Nov
   (ASON) seasons with roughly no discernible trend during Dec-Jan-Feb
   (DJF), and Jun-Jul (JJ) seasons. Overall, annual and seasonal analyses
   of specific temperature and rainfall patterns have shown pronounced
   warming and increased rainfall in the study area.Research highlightsThe
   study reveals significant trends in temperature and rainfall in Beni
   city, Democratic Republic of Congo, over a 31-year period
   (1990-2020).Both minimum and maximum temperatures show significant
   warming trends, with the most recent decade witnessing substantial
   increases in maximum temperatures.Rainfall patterns exhibit variations,
   with a slight upward trend in annual rainfall, although the 1990s
   experienced a notable decrease in precipitation.Monthly analyses
   highlight specific temperature and rainfall patterns with some months
   experiencing pronounced warming and increased rainfall.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal changes in daily temperature and rainfall indices
   are analyzed for the source region of Yellow River. Three periods are
   examined: 1960-1990, 1960-2000 and 1960-2006. Significant warming trends
   have been observed for the whole study region over all the three
   periods, particularly over the period 1960-2006. This warming is mainly
   attributed to a significant increase in the minimum temperature, and
   characterized by pronounced changes in the low temperature events
   composing a significant increase in the magnitude and a significant
   decrease in the frequency. In contrast to the temperature indices, no
   significant changes have been observed in the rainfall indices at the
   majority of stations. However, the rainfall shows noticeable increasing
   trends during winter and spring from a basin-wide point of view.
   Conversely, the frequency and contribution of moderately heavy rainfall
   events to total rainfall show a significant decreasing trend in summer.
   To conclude, this study shows that over the past 40-45 years the source
   region of the Yellow River has become warmer and experienced some
   seasonally varying changes in rainfall, which also supports an emerging
   global picture of warming and the prevailing positive trends in winter
   rainfall extremes over the mid-latitudinal land areas of the Northern
   Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate spatiotemporal variability, trends, and
   anomaly in rainfall and temperature in the Sidama region, Ethiopia. The
   TerraClimate gridded dataset on a monthly time scale for 30 years
   (1991-2020) with a horizontal resolution of approximately 4 km was used
   for the study. Trends in annual and seasonal rainfall and temperature
   were assessed using a nonparametric test (Mann-Kendal test) and Sen's
   slope to test the statistical significance and magnitude of trends
   (increase/decrease), respectively. Our findings revealed that annual
   rainfall, summer (Hawado), and spring (Badhessa) rainfall have shown an
   increasing trend in most parts of the region, except for its northwest
   parts. We found a low annual rainfall variability (CV < 13\%) over the
   southeastern and northwestern parts of the region. Rainfall variability
   revealed the difference in both time and space across the region. Six
   drought years (1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2012, and 2019) with different
   magnitudes were identified across the region. Annual average maximum (up
   to 0.4 degrees C decade(-1)) and minimum (up to 0.25 degrees C
   decade(-1)) temperatures revealed significantly increasing trends across
   the region. The standardized anomaly in the mean annual temperature
   indicated that the years in the recent decade (2011-2020) are getting
   warmer compared to the past two decades (1991-2010) due to natural and
   anthropogenic activities causing weather extremes in the region. The
   results of this study for rainfall contradict the other studies in the
   rift valley part of the region. Therefore, we suggest appropriate
   climate change adaptation strategies so that there is high rainfall and
   temperature variability across the region and between seasons.},

Title = {``Proof of Concept{''} Pilot Study: Bioprocess Chain of Custody and
   Bioresource Sample Management Temperature Observations. Sample Level
   Temperature Trends and Stability Data Obtained Via Utilization of
   Bluechiip® Temperature Tracking Technology},
Journal = {BIOPRESERVATION AND BIOBANKING},
Year = {2013},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Preservation and optimization of biosample integrity to
   foster relevant research results and outcomes is a guiding principle of
   sample management. Tracking pre-analytical biospecimen lifecycle
   variables and bioprocessing chain of custody data enables documentation
   of adherence to best, regulatory and quality bio-banking practices.
   Knowledge of individual sample and sample set temperature variability is
   believed to enhance delineation of artifacts during downstream analysis.
   Analysis of temperature responses may elucidate understanding of
   temperature trends which can aid downstream interpretation and provide
   an empirical foundation for ``fit for purpose{''} sample management
   protocols and evidence-based biobanking practices. Bluechiip and the
   American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) conducted a pilot to test the
   bluechiip technology (R) performance and validate key proofs of concept
   for tracking temperature of biological samples.
   Methods: One hundred six (106) Corning (R) cryovials with bluechiip (R)
   buttons and one hundred six (106) standard Corning (R) cryovials labeled
   with 1-dimensional (1D) barcoded labels were evaluated. Identifiers were
   tracked and temperature data recorded in corresponding environments
   ranging from -192 degrees C to +57 degrees.
   Results: Nine of ten proof of concepts, defined in collaboration with
   ATCC successfully demonstrated functional capabilities of the bluechiip
   (R) technology. Bar-code label read performance was compared, producing
   evidence demonstrating a high rate of failure on the bar-code arm.
   Conclusion: Temperature data collected heightened observations of sample
   temperature variability. Prevalence of bar-code label read failure and
   issues affecting reliability of barcode performance may be
   under-reported and unrecognized in sample management practice,
   particularly when the temperatures are lower than -60 degrees C. It
   appears the bluechiip (R) tracking technology may offer increased
   reliability over one-dimensional (1D) bar-coding technology; however
   while promising these findings require validation in future trials,
   including two-dimensional (2D) bar-coding technologies.},

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {The precipitation trend patterns in South America (SA) are determined
   using trend empirical orthogonal function analysis for the 1951-2016
   period. The associated large-scale tropical and extratropical anomalous
   circulation patterns are also examined. The words ``total{''} and
   ``residual{''} refer to the monthly anomalies and monthly anomalies
   without the El Ni \& ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effects,
   respectively. The total precipitation features a positive trend in
   southeastern SA (SESA, southern Brazil, Uruguay, most of eastern
   Argentina) and northern Chile, and a negative trend over central-eastern
   Brazil and central Amazonia. The residual precipitation shows an
   increased positive trend over most of the coastal extension of northern
   SA and Colombia; a weak positive trend over southern Brazil,
   northeastern Argentina, and northern Chile; and a negative trend over
   central-eastern SA and western Amazonia. The differences between the
   total and residual precipitation trend patterns in tropical SA is
   explained as responses to total and residual zonally asymmetric
   anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) patterns, respectively. The
   total SST pattern along the equatorial Pacific configures the Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation, which impacts ENSO variability and as response
   intensifies the Walker circulation. Without the ENSO, the Walker cell is
   mainly driven by the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans, which
   configure residual asymmetric anomalous warming. Furthermore, the
   warming in the equatorial Indian and eastern Pacific Oceans, in the
   presence of ENSO, induces a Rossby wave train-type anomalous pattern
   that extends across the South Pacific into SA and modulates the
   atmospheric anomalous circulation over SESA. In this region, an
   anomalous anticyclonic accompanied by an intensified South American
   Low-Level Jet induces a moisture transport to SESA. This anticyclone is
   also observed in the absence of ENSO but is weaker. The results suggest
   the importance of ocean warming in the western Pacific-Indian in the
   modulation of extratropical teleconnections to SESA in the tropical
   ocean warming scenario.},

Title = {Identifying the effect of climate change on desertification in northern
   China via trend analysis of potential evapotranspiration and
   precipitation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Desertification and its causes are dynamic processes, which therefore
   make it necessary to discuss the factors that drive desertification in a
   specific spatiotemporal sense. Here the temporal trends in potential
   evapotranspiration (PE) and precipitation were selected as climate
   change indicators, five possible scenarios were established and
   relationships between desertification and the climate change indicators
   were examined for different time periods across northern China. The
   results indicate that climate change was the primary or one of drivers
   of desertification reversion in the northeastern and northwestern
   regions of China between 1975 and.
   1990, whereas the desertification reversion near Mu Us Desert was
   influenced primarily by human intervention. Climate change triggered
   desertification variation across the entire region, including the
   Hulenbur, Otigdag, Horqin, Horbq, and Mu Us deserts and the Sounite
   Grassland between 1990 and 2000. However, the desertification reversion
   near the Otindag, Mu Us and Horqin deserts was due primarily to human
   intervention. Desertification reversion occurred across 54,609 km(2)
   between 2000 and 2005 in northern China and climate change was thought
   to be related to majority reversion, whereas the regions that
   experienced desertification development and aggravation, including the
   areas near the Hulunbuir and Nengjiang deserts, were influenced
   primarily by human intervention. Broad desertification reversion
   occurred across the North China region between 2005 and 2010, with
   45,787 km(2) experiencing desertification reversion compared with only
   8026 km(2) experiencing desertification development and aggravation,
   however, climate change had a limited effect on desertification in this
   period. The study provides a new understanding of the causes of
   desertification, and an easier and more effective framework for
   determining the role of climate change on desertification.},

Abstract = {Here, we present an analysis of monthly, seasonal, and annual long-term
   precipitation time-series compiled from coastal meteorological stations
   in Greenland and Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) ice cores (including three
   new ice core records from ACT11D, Tunu2013, and Summit2010). The dataset
   covers the period from 1890 to 2012, a period of climate warming. For
   approximately the first decade of the new millennium (2001-2012) minimum
   and maximum mean annual precipitation conditions are found in Northeast
   Greenland (Tunu2013 c. 120mm water equivalent (w.e.) year(-1)) and South
   Greenland (Ikerasassuaq: c. 2300mm w.e. year(-1)), respectively. The
   coastal meteorological stations showed on average increasing trends for
   1890-2012 (3.5mm w.e. year(-2)) and 1961-2012 (1.3mm w.e. year(-2)).
   Years with high coastal annual precipitation also had a: (1) significant
   high number of precipitation days (r(2) = 0.59); and (2) high
   precipitation intensity measured as 24-h precipitation (r(2) = 0.54).
   For the GrIS the precipitation estimated from ice cores increased on
   average by 0.1mm w.e. year(-2) (1890-2000), showing an antiphase
   variability in precipitation trends between the GrIS and the coastal
   regions. Around 1960 a major shift occurred in the precipitation pattern
   towards wetter precipitation conditions for coastal Greenland, while
   drier conditions became more prevalent on the GrIS. Differences in
   precipitation trends indicate a heterogeneous spatial distribution of
   precipitation in Greenland. An Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis
   reveals a spatiotemporal cycle of precipitation that is linked
   instantaneously to the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation and with an approximate to 6 years lag time
   response to the Greenland Blocking Index.},

Abstract = {Global warming is a significant global environmental problem in the 21st
   century. The problem is high in developing countries, particularly
   sub-Saharan countries in which the majority of the population live on
   rainfed agriculture. The present study aimed to undertake spatiotemporal
   analysis of seasonal and annual rainfall and temperature and its
   implications. The MK test, Sen's slope and precipitation concentration
   index (PCI) were applied. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis between
   climatic variables and crop production was analysed. The Mann-Kendall
   test results showed that the annual and seasonal rainfall trend was
   highly variable. The minimum and maximum temperatures have increased by
   0.8 and 1.1 degrees C/year, respectively. Based on PCI results, rainfall
   during the summer and spring seasons is moderately distributed as
   compared to annual and winter season rainfall. Based on these
   observations, the rainfall pattern and distribution of the area could be
   classified as irregular and erratic distribution. Results of correlation
   analysis between monthly and seasonal rainfall with crop production were
   insufficient to conclude the impact of rainfall and temperature on crop
   production. In view of this, the incidence of food shortage is a common
   occurrence. Therefore, depending on the historical trend of rainfall
   variability and prolonged temperature increase, appropriate coping and
   adaptation strategies need to be encouraged.},

Abstract = {The problem of detecting hydrometeorological trends is still a concern.
   In this study, monthly, seasonal, and annual temperature and
   precipitation variations in the Van Province of Turkiye are assessed
   using both traditional such as Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's Rho
   (SRHO) and graphical such as Innovative trend significance test (ITA-ST)
   and Innovative polygon trend analysis (IPTA) methods. In order to
   determine trend slope and change-point detection, Sen's Slope and
   Sequential Mann-Kendall tests are also used, respectively. The findings
   show that the MK, SRHO, and ITA-ST approaches detect a decreasing trend
   for annual total precipitation at the Ercis and Baskale stations.
   Additionally, the MAM and SON seasons at Ercis and the SON season at
   Gevas stations also show a noticeably decreasing trend. All stations
   have an increasing trend at a 95\% significant level for annual mean
   temperatures. Except Gevas station, all four seasons have an increasing
   trend for temperature series. Results from the IPTA show that for
   precipitation data, the transition from May to June exhibits the highest
   trend length. In addition, for temperature data, the minimum trend
   length and slope are captured in the transition from July to August. In
   general, ITA-ST and IPTA are superior to MK and SRHO at identifying
   trends and that the outcomes of these methods are significantly more
   suitable to visual inspection and linguistic interpretation. Different
   hydro-climatological variables can be analyzed more flexibly and
   thoroughly utilizing innovative methodologies.},

Abstract = {A study was undertaken to investigate differences between laboratory and
   field pH measurements for precipitation samples collected from 135
   weekly precipitation-monitoring sites in the National Trends Network
   from 12/30/1986 to 12/28/1999. Differences in pH between field and
   laboratory measurements occurred for 96\% of samples collected during
   this time period. Differences between the two measurements were
   evaluated for precipitation samples collected before and after January
   1994, when modifications to sample-handling protocol and elimination of
   the contaminating bucket o-ring used in sample shipment occurred. Median
   hydrogen-ion and pH differences between field and laboratory
   measurements declined from 3.9 mueq L-1 or 0.10 pH units before the 1994
   protocol change to 1.4 mueq L-1 or 0.04 pH units after the 1994 protocol
   change. Hydrogen-ion differences between field and laboratory
   measurements had a high correlation with the sample pH determined in the
   field. The largest pH differences between the two measurements occurred
   for high-pH samples (>5.6), typical of precipitation collected in
   Western United States; however low-pH samples (<5.0) displayed the
   highest variability in hydrogen-ion differences between field and
   laboratory analyses. Properly screened field pH measurements are a
   useful alternative to laboratory pH values for trend analysis,
   particularly before 1994 when laboratory pH values were influenced by
   sample-collection equipment.},

Abstract = {Observed trends in seasonal and annual total rainfall, number of rain
   days and daily maximum and minimum temperature were calculated for a
   number of stations in South Africa for the period 1960-2010.
   Statistically significant decreases in rainfall and the number of rain
   days are shown over the central and northeastern parts of the country in
   the autumn months and significant increases in the number of rain days
   around the southern Drakensberg are evident in spring and summer.
   Maximum temperatures have increased significantly throughout the country
   for all seasons and increases in minimum temperatures are shown for most
   of the country. A notable exception is the central interior, where
   minimum temperatures have decreased significantly. Regionally aggregated
   trends for six water management zones covering the entire country are
   not evident for total rainfall, but there are some significant trends
   for the number of rain days. Temperature in these zones has increased
   significantly for most seasons, with the exception of the central
   interior. Comparison of the observed trends with statistically
   downscaled global climate model simulations reveals that the models do
   not represent the observed rainfall changes nor the cooling trend of
   minimum temperature in the central interior. Although this result does
   not rule out the possibility of attributing observed local changes in
   rainfall to anthropogenically forced global change, it does have major
   implications for attribution studies. It also raises the question of
   whether an alternative statistical downscaling method or dynamical
   downscaling through the use of a regional climate model might better
   represent regional and local climatic processes and their links to
   global change.},

Abstract = {This paper examined future trends with change detection in temperature
   and rainfall over three agro-climatic zones of West Africa. Historical
   (1961-2000) and projection (2020-2099) data of ensemble-mean of six RCMs
   that dynamically downscaled five GCMs that participated in CMIP5
   obtained from Co-Ordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment
   (CORDEX) were used. Standard normal homogeneity, Buishand's, Pettitt's,
   and Mann-Kendall test were used for change point detection and trend
   analysis at 5\% significant level. Inter-annual anomaly and projected
   change in the seasonal cycle relative to historical mean were
   investigated. The ensemble-mean evaluation performed for the historical
   period (1961-2000) using CRU dataset revealed that the change point
   occurred in rainfall and temperature series in the 1970s and 1980s,
   while a significant increasing trend is observed in temperature in all
   climatic zones. Change-point detection test projects rainfall series to
   be homogeneous as significant change point is expected to occur in
   temperature for all zones under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for near (2020-2059)
   and far-future (2060-2099). For the near-future, an increase in the mean
   temperature between 0.5-1.30 celcius and 0.19-1.67 celcius is projected
   to occur under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. Projected relative change
   in seasonal cycle shows that winter months may witness increase in
   rainfall amounts under RCP4.5 but significantly dry under RCP8.5 in near
   and far-future as temperature is expected to become warmer in all
   months. Rainfall anomaly projects the Sahel to have a reduced amount of
   rainfall compared to other zones as temperature anomaly reveals a
   continuous increase in all the zones under the two RCPs. The results of
   this study show that climate change will intensify in West Africa in the
   future.},

Abstract = {Global warming and climate variability are emerging as the foremost
   environmental problems in the 21st century, especially in developing
   countries. Full knowledge of key climate change variables is crucial in
   managing water resources in river basins. This study examines the
   variability of air temperature and rainfall in the five states of
   South-Eastern region of Nigeria, using the trend analysis approach. For
   this purpose, temporal trends in annual rainfall and temperature were
   detected using non-parametric Mann-Kendall test at 5\% significance
   level. The time series rainfall and temperature data for the period
   1922-2008 were analyzed statistically for each state separately. The
   results of Mann Kendall test showed that there is trend in rainfall in
   all the capital cities in South-East except Owerri and Awka. It is also
   observed that the trend of rainfall is decreasing for all the study
   areas in South-East with the lowest trend rate of-0.1153 mm rainfall
   occurring in Umuahia. In the case of air temperature, it is observed
   that the trend is increasing for all the study areas in South-East with
   the highest trend rate of 0.04698 degrees C/year occurring in Enugu.
   These findings provide valuable information for assessing the influence
   of changes on air temperature and rainfall on water resources and
   references for water management in the South-Eastern river basin of
   Nigeria. It also proved that Mann-Kendall technique is an effective tool
   in analyzing temperature and rainfall trends in a regional watershed.},

Abstract = {Rainfall and temperature are the most important environmental factors
   influencing crop growth, development, and yield. The northwestern (NW)
   part of India is one of the main regions of food grain production of the
   country. It comprises of six meteorological subdivisions (Haryana,
   Punjab, West Rajasthan, East Rajasthan, Gujarat and Saurashtra, Kutch
   and Diu). In this study, attempts were made to study variability and
   trends in rainfall and temperature during 30-year climate normal periods
   (CN) and 10-year decadal excess or deficit rainfall frequency during the
   historical period from 1871 to 2016. The Mann-Kendall and Spearman's
   rank correlation (Spearman's rho) tests were used to determine
   significance of trends. Least square linear fitting method was adopted
   to find out the slopes of the trend lines. The long-term mean annual
   rainfall over North West India is 587.7mm (standard deviation of 153.0mm
   and coefficient of variation 26.0). There was increasing trend in
   minimum and maximum temperatures during post monsoon season in entire
   study period and current climate normal period (1991-2016) due to which
   the sowing of rabi season crops may be delayed and there may be
   germination problem too. There was a non-significant decreasing trend in
   rainfall during monsoon season and an increasing trend in rainfall
   during post monsoon over North West India during entire study period.
   During current CN5 (1991-2016), all the subdivision (except the
   Saurashtra region) showed a decreasing trend in rainfall during monsoon
   season which is a matter of concern for kharif crops and those rabi
   crops which are grown as rainfed on conserved soil moisture. The decadal
   annual and seasonal frequencies of excess and deficit years results
   revealed that the annual total deficit rainfall years (24) exceeded
   total excess rainfall years (22) in North West India during the entire
   study period. While during the current decadal period (2011 to 2016),
   single year was the excess year and 2years were deficit rainfall years
   in all subdivisions (except East Rajasthan) on annual basis.},

Abstract = {The flood risk across the globe is intensified due to global warming and
   subsequent increase in extreme temperature and precipitation. The
   long-term trends in extreme rainfall (1944-2013) and temperature
   (1969-2012) indices have been investigated at annual, seasonal, and
   monthly time scales using nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK), modified
   Mann-Kendall (MMK), and Sen's slope estimator tests. The extreme
   rainfall and temperature indices, recommended by the Expert Team on
   Climate Change Detection Monitoring Indices (ETCCDMI), have been
   analyzed at finer spatial scales for trend detection. The results of
   trend analyses indicate decreasing trend in annual total rainfall,
   significant decreasing trend in rainy days, and increasing trend in
   rainfall intensity over the basin. The seasonal rainfall has been found
   to decrease for all the seasons except postmonsoon, which could affect
   the rain-fed agriculture in the basin. The 1- and 5-day annual maximum
   rainfalls exhibit mixed trends, wherein part of the basin experiences
   increasing trend, while other parts experience a decreasing trend. The
   increase in dry spells and concurrent decrease in wet spells are also
   observed over the basin. The extreme temperature indices revealed
   increasing trends in hottest and coldest days, while decreasing trends
   in coldest night are found over most parts of the basin. Further, the
   diurnal temperature range is also found to increase due to warming
   tendency in maximum temperature (T-max) at a faster rate compared to the
   minimum temperature (T-min). The increase in frequency and magnitude of
   extreme rainfall in the basin has been attributed to the increasing
   trend in maximum and minimum temperatures, reducing forest cover, rapid
   pace of urbanization, increase in human population, and thereby increase
   in the aerosol content in the atmosphere. The findings of the present
   study would significantly help in sustainable water resource planning,
   better decision-making for policy framework, and setting up
   infrastructure against flood disasters in Upper Tapi Basin, India.},

Abstract = {Monthly average sea-surface temperatures (SST) derived from NOAA-AVHRR
   remote sensing data are analyzed for the period 1982-2011 for the Gulf
   of St. Lawrence (Canada) and compared to monthly average air
   temperature. Results show that SST increased by 1 to 1.5 degrees C
   during the period when averaging from May to November of each year, a
   change associated with interdecadal variability rather than a long term
   trend. SST averaged over the ice-free months of May-November is strongly
   correlated to an index of the April-November air temperature anomaly,
   capturing up to 90\% of the variance, suggesting strong coupling between
   air and sea-surface temperatures on seasonal time scales.
   The air temperature anomaly index series can be used as a proxy for
   longer term climate variability of SST prior to 1982. Overall warming
   trends in air temperature of 0.9 degrees C and 0.6 degrees C per century
   were found using data from weather stations dating back to 1873 and from
   the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis that
   goes back to 1871. The strong co-variations of SST and air temperature
   indicate that the SST has likely increased by a similar amount. These
   co-variations will help to predict the response of the Gulf water
   temperature to changing climate as well as provide a perspective with
   respect to changes that have occurred in the previous century. Crown

   This study uses a newly updated global land surface air temperature and
   a land and marine surface temperature dataset, referred to as China
   global land surface air temperature (C-LSAT) and China merged surface
   temperature (CMST), to estimate trends in the global mean ST (combining

   trend during the past century (1900-2017) remains unchanged, while the
   recent warming trend during the ``hiatus{''} period (1998-012) increases
   obviously, which is statistically significant at 95\% level when fitting
   uncertainty is considered as in previous studies (including IPCC AR5)
   and is significant at 90\% level when both fitting and data
   uncertainties are considered. Our analysis shows that the global mean ST
   warming trends in this short period become closer among the newly
   developed global observational data (CMST), remotely sensed/Buoy network
   infilled datasets, and reanalysis data. Based on the new datasets, the
   warming trends of global mean land SAT as derived from C-LSAT 2.0 for
   the period of 1979-2019, 1951-2019, 1900-2019 and 1850-2019 were
   estimated to be 0.296, 0.219, 0.119 and 0.081 degrees C/decade,
   respectively. The warming trends of global mean ST as derived from CMST
   for the periods of 1998-2019, 1979-2019, 1951-2019 and 1900-2019 were
   estimated to be 0.195, 0.173, 0.145 and 0.091 degrees C/decade,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Despite numerous room temperature experiments that indicate surface
   scattering is almost fully diffuse, low temperature resistivity data
   from narrow lines don't show the generally expected temperature
   dependent surface scattering contribution seen for large grained thin
   films. Here we show a detailed study of the trends expected for surface
   scattering using a numerical integration of the general equations. It
   shows that the surface scattering induce non-linear behavior requires
   the asymmetrical shape of a thin films cross-section in order to be
   manifest itself and is considerably reduced for square lines. This
   analysis also leads to a re-evaluation of using Matthiessen's rule for
   cross-section extraction, which has a significant effect on the
   separation of various scattering contributions. It leads to the
   conclusion that surface scattering is the main contributor to the
   resistivity increase and research should be refocused on how to reduce
   this contribution.},

Abstract = {We compiled and analyzed a daily time series of temperatures and
   precipitation totals from Mount Wilson, California from 1918 to 1998.
   Our results show a large decline in maximum temperature, no change or an
   upward trend in minimum temperature, and a substantial decline in the
   diurnal temperature range (DTR). The interannual variations in monthly
   maximum temperature and DTR are significantly correlated with monthly
   precipitation levels, sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) off the coast of
   Southern California, and the Southern Oscillation Index(SOI). El Nino
   periods and/or months with high SST anomalies tend to be wet with lower
   maximum temperatures and DTR while La Nifia periods and/or months of
   lower SSTs are hotter and drier with higher DTR values. It is noteworthy
   that the SOI and SSTs have significant trends toward more El Nino-like
   conditions with higher SSTs off Southern California.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Temperature data from radiosondes over Germany have been homogenized
   manually. The method makes use of the different radiosonde (RS) networks
   existing in East and West Germany until 1990. The largest temperature
   adjustments, up to 2.5 K, apply to Freiberg sondes used in the east in
   the 1950s and 1960s. Adjustments for Graw Hamburg 1948 (H48), 1950
   (H50), and Munich 1960 (M60) sondes, used in the west from the 1950s to
   the late 1980s, and for RKZ sondes, used in the east in the 1970s and
   1980s, are also significant: 0.3-0.5 K. Small differences between
   Vaisala RS80 and RS92 sondes used throughout Germany since 1990 and
   \~{}2004, respectively, were not corrected for at levels from the ground
   to 300 hPa. Comparison of the homogenized data with other
   datasets-Radiosonde Innovation Composite Homogenization (RICH) and
   Hadley Centre Atmospheric Temperature, version 2 (HadAT2)-and with
   Microwave Sounding Unit satellite data shows generally good agreement.
   HadAT2 data exhibit a few suspicious spikes in the 1970s and 1980s and
   some suspicious offsets up to 1 K after 1995. Compared to RICH, the
   homogenized data show slightly different temperatures, by less than
   \~{}0.4 K, in the 1960s and 1970s. As reported in other studies, the
   troposphere over Germany has been warming by 0.2 +/- 0.1 K decade(-1)
   from \~{}1950 to 2013, and the stratosphere has been cooling. The
   stratospheric trend increases from almost no change near 230 hPa (the
   tropopause) to -0.4 +/- 0.2 K decade(-1) near 50 hPa. Trends from the
   homogenized data are more positive by about 0.1 K decade(-1) compared to
   the original data, both in the troposphere and stratosphere.},

Abstract = {The skill of six regional climate models (RCMs) in reproducing
   short-term (24-yr). observed, near-surface temperature trends when
   driven by reanalysis is examined. The RCMs are part of the North
   American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). If RCMs
   can reproduce observed temperature trends, then they are, in a way,
   demonstrating their ability to capture a type of climate change, which
   may be relevant to their ability to credibly simulate anthropogenic
   climate changes under future emission scenarios. This study finds that
   the NARCCAP RCMs can simulate some resolved-scale temperature trends,
   especially those seen recently in spring and, by and large, in winter.
   However, results in other seasons suggest that RCM performance in this
   measure may be dependent on the type and strength of the forcing behind
   the observed trends.},

Abstract = {Simulated stratospheric temperatures over the period 1979-2016 in models
   from the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative are compared with recently
   updated and extended satellite data sets. The multimodel mean global
   temperature trends over 1979-2005 are -0.88 +/- 0.23, -0.70 +/- 0.16,
   and -0.50 +/- 0.12K/decade for the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU)
   channels 3 (similar to 40-50 km), 2 (similar to 35-45 km), and 1
   (similar to 25-35 km), respectively (with 95\% confidence intervals).
   These are within the uncertainty bounds of the observed temperature
   trends from two reprocessed SSU data sets. In the lower stratosphere,
   the multimodel mean trend in global temperature for the Microwave
   Sounding Unit channel 4 (similar to 13-22 km) is -0.25 +/- 0.12 K/decade
   over 1979-2005, consistent with observed estimates from three versions
   of this satellite record. The models and an extended satellite data set
   comprised of SSU with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A show weaker
   global stratospheric cooling over 1998-2016 compared to the period of
   intensive ozone depletion (1979-1997). This is due to the reduction in
   ozone-induced cooling from the slowdown of ozone trends and the onset of
   ozone recovery since the late 1990s. In summary, the results show much
   better consistency between simulated and satellite-observed
   stratospheric temperature trends than was reported by Thompson et al.
   (2012, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579) for the previous versions of
   the SSU record and chemistry-climate models. The improved agreement
   mainly comes from updates to the satellite records; the range of
   stratospheric temperature trends over 1979-2005 simulated in
   Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative models is comparable to the previous
   generation of chemistry-climate models.
   Plain Language Summary A previous analysis by Thompson et al. (2012,
   https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579) showed substantial differences
   between satellite-observed and model-simulated stratospheric cooling
   trends since the late 1970s. Here we compare recently revised and
   extended satellite temperature records with new simulations from 14
   chemistry-climate models. The results show much better agreement in the
   magnitude of stratospheric cooling over 1979-2005 between models and
   observations. This cooling was predominantly driven by increasing
   greenhouse gases and declining stratospheric ozone levels. An extended
   satellite temperature record and the chemistry-climate models show
   weaker global stratospheric cooling over 1998-2016 compared to
   1979-1997. This is due to the reduction in ozone-induced cooling from
   the slowdown of ozone trends and the onset of ozone recovery since the
   late 1990s. There are larger differences in the latitudinal structure of
   past stratospheric temperature trends due to the effects of unforced
   atmospheric variability. In summary, the results show much better
   consistency between simulated and satellite-observed stratospheric
   temperature trends than was reported by Thompson et al. (2012,
   https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579 ) for the previous versions of the
   satellite record and last generation of chemistry-climate models. The
   improved agreement mainly comes from updates to the satellite records,
   while the range of simulated trends is comparable to the previous
   generation of models.},

Title = {Decadal trends in Red Sea maximum surface temperature},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Ocean warming is a major consequence of climate change, with the surface
   of the ocean having warmed by 0.11 degrees C decade(-1) over the last 50
   years and is estimated to continue to warm by an additional 0.6 - 2.0
   degrees C before the end of the century(1). However, there is
   considerable variability in the rates experienced by different ocean
   regions, so understanding regional trends is important to inform on
   possible stresses for marine organisms, particularly in warm seas where
   organisms may be already operating in the high end of their thermal
   tolerance. Although the Red Sea is one of the warmest ecosystems on
   earth, its historical warming trends and thermal evolution remain
   largely understudied. We characterized the Red Sea's thermal regimes at
   the basin scale, with a focus on the spatial distribution and changes
   over time of sea surface temperature maxima, using remotely sensed sea
   surface temperature data from 1982 - 2015. The overall rate of warming
   for the Red Sea is 0.17 +/- 0.07 degrees C decade(-1), while the
   northern Red Sea is warming between 0.40 and 0.45 degrees C decade(-1),
   all exceeding the global rate. Our findings show that the Red Sea is
   fast warming, which may in the future challenge its organisms and
   communities.},

Title = {Review of mesospheric temperature trends -: art. no. 1015},
Journal = {REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT 22},
Abstract = {{[}1] In recent times it has become increasingly clear that releases of
   trace gases from human activity have a potential for causing change in
   the upper atmosphere. However, our knowledge of systematic changes and
   trends in the temperature of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere is
   relatively limited compared to the Earth's lower atmosphere, and not
   much effort has been made to synthesize these results so far. In this
   article, a comprehensive review of long-term trends in the temperature
   of the region from 50 to 100 km is made on the basis of the available
   up-to-date understanding of measurements and model calculations. An
   objective evaluation of the available data sets is attempted, and
   important uncertainly factors are discussed. Some natural variability
   factors, which are likely to play a role in modulating temperature
   trends, are also briefly touched upon. There are a growing number of
   experimental results centered on, or consistent with, zero temperature
   trend in the mesopause region ( 80 - 100 km). The most reliable data
   sets show no significant trend but an uncertainty of at least 2
   K/decade. On the other hand, a majority of studies indicate negative
   trends in the lower and middle mesosphere with an amplitude of a few
   degrees ( 2 - 3 K) per decade. In tropical latitudes the cooling trend
   increases in the upper mesosphere. The most recent general circulation
   models indicate increased cooling closer to both poles in the middle
   mesosphere and a decrease in cooling toward the summer pole in the upper
   mesosphere. Quantitatively, the simulated cooling trend in the middle
   mesosphere produced only by CO2 increase is usually below the observed
   level. However, including other greenhouse gases and taking into account
   a ``thermal shrinking{''} of the upper atmosphere result in a cooling of
   a few degrees per decade. This is close to the lower limit of the
   observed nonzero trends. In the mesopause region, recent model
   simulations produce trends, usually below 1 K/decade, that appear to be
   consistent with most observations in this region.},

Abstract = {Analysis of the global mean surface air temperature has shown that its
   increase is due, at least in part, to differential changes in daily
   maximum and minimum temperatures, resulting in a narrowing of the
   diurnal temperature range (DTR). The analysis, using station metadata
   and improved areal coverage for much of the Southern Hemisphere
   landmass, indicates that the DTR is continuing to decrease in most parts
   of the world that urban effects on globally and hemispherically averaged
   time series are negligible, and that circulation variations in parts oi
   the Northern Hemisphere appear to be related to the DTR. Atmospheric
   aerosol loading in the Southern Hemisphere is much less than that in the
   Northern Hemisphere, suggesting that there are likely a number of
   factors, such as increases in cloudiness, contributing to the decreases
   in DTR.},

Abstract = {Soil temperature change is reported to be an important indicator of
   climate change, as soil temperature integrates all processes occurring
   at and above the soil surface. Analysis of long-term trends in soil
   temperatures and their relationship to climatic variables could provide
   valuable information on climate change. In this study, soil temperature
   trends were analysed on seasonal and annual scales at depths of 5, 10,
   20, 50 and 100cm over the period from the 1970s to 2006 at eight sites
   in the Buyuk Menderes Basin in Western Turkey. Also, air temperature,
   rainfall and sunshine duration records were analysed for trends, and for
   their correlations with soil temperatures. The results showed a general
   increase in soil temperatures at all depths and in all seasons. The most
   significant warmings were observed in summer, especially in the upper
   layers (5, 10 and 20cm). The trend magnitudes ranged from -0.91 to 2.05
   degrees C decade(-1), depending on site, season and depth. It was
   observed that air temperature had a clear and dominant influence on soil
   temperature change. Soil temperatures were also affected by sunshine
   duration and rainfall. These findings are expected to contribute to our
   understanding of the linkage between soil temperature change and global
   warming.},

Abstract = {Warm target effect and diurnal drift errors are the main sources of
   uncertainties in the trend determination from the NOAA Microwave
   Sounding Unit (MSU) observations. Currently, there are two methods to
   correct the warm target effect: 1) finding a best root-level (level-1c)
   calibration nonlinearity using simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO)
   matchups to minimize this effect for each scene radiance, and 2) finding
   a best-fit empirical relationship between the correction term of the
   end-level gridded brightness temperature and warm target temperature and
   then removing the best fit from the unadjusted time series. The former
   corrects the warm target effect before the diurnal drift adjustment and
   provides more accurate, warm target effect-minimized, level-1c scene
   radiances for reanalysis applications. The latter corrects the warm
   target effect at the end-level merging step, which depend on the diurnal
   drift correction that occurred at a previous step. Although minimized,
   the first method still leaves small residual warm target-related errors
   due to imperfect calibrations. This study demonstrates that when the
   diurnal drift effect is negligible, a combination of the two methods
   completely removes warm target effect and produces an invariant trend
   that is independent of the level-1c calibration in the SNO framework.
   The conclusion is directly applicable to the MSU channel-2 oceanic
   midtropospheric temperature (T-2) and global channel-3
   upper-tropospheric temperature (T-3) and channel-4 lower-stratospheric
   temperature (T-4), which satisfy the condition of negligible diurnal
   drift effect. On the basis of these results, version 1.2 of the National
   Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)-Center
   for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) multisatellite MSU time
   series was constructed, including all T-2, T-3, and T-4 products. In
   addition, a diurnal drift correction based on the Remote Sensing Systems
   diurnal anomalies was applied to the T-2 product, which produces
   consistent climate trends between land and ocean. The global long-term
   climate trends for T-2 and T-4 derived from the STAR V1.2 dataset are,
   respectively, 0.18 +/- 0.05 and -0.39 +/- 0.36 K decade(-1) during
   1979-2006; the T-3 trend is 0.11 +/- 0.08 K decade(-1) for 1981-2006.},

Abstract = {Twentieth century temperature records for a latitudinal band extending
   from 10-degrees-N to 50-degrees-N are stratified using a recent UNEP map
   showing areas affected by overgrazing.  Linear trend analysis shows that
   the overgrazed areas have warmed at a rate of 0.0057 K year-1 while land
   areas in the latitudinal band not impacted by overgrazing have warmed at
   a rate of 0.0035 K year-1.  The difference in temperature between the
   two groups has increased at a statistically significant rate over the
   1901-1990 time period.  While this temperature increase apparently
   associated with overgrazing may be important locally and regionally, the
   impact of overgrazing probably accounts for less than 1\% of global
   warming over the same time period.},

Abstract = {Climate change does not occur in the same way worldwide; its effects
   display regional differences. Some regions with unique characteristics
   may experience dramatic changes, leading to significant indications for
   the global climate. The Siberian high, a system of high atmospheric
   pressure, is formed on the Central Siberian Plateau, affecting a
   significant part of the northern hemisphere from November to February.
   Climate changes in this region have significant influences on the global
   climate cycle. Hence, determining the temperature trends of this region
   will yield key indicators for climate change studies. Remote sensing
   provides useful databases for climate change studies, surface
   temperatures, temporal and spatial resolutions, and numerous advantages.
   In the present study, we aimed to determine the temporal and spatial
   surface temperature trends of the Central Siberian Plateau. As our data
   source, we used MODIS (Aqua and Terra) satellite images for 8 days
   between 2002- and 2021. The measurements from the region were arranged
   as monthly and annual values, presented as mean, minimum, maximum, and
   standard deviation. Then, using these data, we obtained the mean values
   for the region and performed Mann-Kendall trend analyses. Accordingly,
   there was an overall increase of more than 2 degrees C in the study
   area. We performed a pixel-based Mann-Kendall trend test to reveal the
   mean annual temperatures and detect local changes. Our findings showed
   significant rises in temperature in the northern part of the study area.},

Pages = {131-139},
Abstract = {The long-term trend of diurnal temperature range (DTR) over Nigeria was
   examined using daily station-based datasets for the period 1971-2013.
   The results show that the regionally averaged DTR has decreased
   significantly (-0.34 degrees C per decade) over the Nigerian Sahel
   (north of 10 degrees N), but there has been a slight increasing trend
   (0.01 degrees C per decade) over the Nigerian Guinea Coast. The annual
   decreasing trend of DTR in the Nigerian Sahel is mainly attributable to
   the significant increasing trend in daily minimum temperature (T-min,
   0.51 degrees C per decade), which far outstrips the rate of increase in
   the daily maximum (T-max, 0.17 degrees C per decade). In contrast, the
   comparable trends in T-min (0.19 degrees C per decade) and T-max (0.20
   degrees C per decade) may explain the non-significant trend of the DTR
   averaged over the Guinea Coast region. It is observed that the DTR has
   decreased more in boreal summer (June-July-August) than in boreal winter
   (December-January-February) for the regions. Furthermore, it is found
   that the significant DTR declining trend over the Nigerian Sahel is
   closely associated with an increasing trend of annual and summer
   precipitation in the region, but the increasing DTR trend in the
   Nigerian Guinea Coast region can be attributed to the decreasing trend
   of cloud cover over the region.},

Abstract = {The analysis of thickness derived from the National Center for
   Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis indicates that there has been
   no statistically significant warming trend in layer-averaged global
   tropospheric temperatures during the period 1979-1996. While this result
   is at variance with data based on surface information, NCEP trends and
   interannual variations are closely related to tropospheric mean-layer
   temperatures obtained from the satellite-based microwave sounding unit
   (MSU) lower-trospospheric data set. When a longer period, 1973-1996, is
   used for the NCEP analysis, a warming trend within a 95\% confidence
   interval is derived. However, it is nearly half the magnitude of the
   surface-derived trends. Strong correlations of the yearly global surface
   temperature anomalies and those calculated for several layers in the
   NCEP data indicate coincident interannual temperature variations
   throughout the depth of the troposphere. The disagreement of both our
   analysis and satellite-derived estimates with surface data could be due
   to a land surface measurement bias, a result of land use changes such as
   deforestation and agricultural expansion whose effects are not yet
   accounted for in the global temperature records, and/or a decoupling
   between surface and lower-tropospheric temperature over the last several
   years.},

Abstract = {Diurnal asymmetry of the recent surface warming, reported for several
   continental areas, is believed to be related to changes in cloudiness,
   humidity, atmospheric circulation patterns, winds and soil moisture.
   This paper presents linear trend analyses of maximum and minimum
   temperature data at 121 stations in India during the period 1901-87.
   While the mean temperature trends over India are similar to the global
   and hemispheric trends, there are marked differences in their diurnal
   manifestation from those reported for other areas. The increase in the
   mean temperatures over India is almost solely contributed by the maximum
   temperatures, with the minimum temperatures remaining practically
   trendless, leading to an increase in the diurnal range of temperatures.
   These trends do not show any significant urban or altitude bias. There
   are some differences in the trends on smaller spatial and temporal
   scales, but the increase of maximum temperature is predominant over a
   major part of India, particularly in winter and post-monsoon seasons.},

Title = {Relationship between temperature trend magnitude, elevation and mean
   temperature in the Tibetan Plateau from homogenized surface stations and
   reanalysis data},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {Temperature trend magnitudes at 71 homogenized surface stations with
   elevations above 2000 m asl in the eastern and central Tibetan Plateau
   (TP) and 56 grid points from surface NCEP and ERA-40 reanalyses in the
   TP's vicinity are examined. Both the surface meteorological stations and
   ERA-40 show general warming trends at the majority of locations,
   especially in winter. NCEP fails to identify this. Compared with the
   surface stations, both NCEP and ERA-40 reanalysis data underestimate air
   temperature trends in the TP, but ERA-40 is better than NCEP. There are
   no simple linear relationships between elevation and temperature trend
   magnitudes on an annual or seasonal basis in the surface data or ERA-40,
   and in NCEP this relationship is inconsistent. Instead there are
   significant correlations between mean annual and seasonal temperatures
   and temperature trend magnitudes in the surface dataset and NCEP data
   (but not ERA-40). We suggest this is due to cryospheric feedback since
   trends are enhanced when mean annual temperatures are near freezing. The
   absence of any simple elevation dependency in temperature trends
   suggests that the rapid warming rate derived from high elevation
   ice-cores in this region should be interpreted with caution. In
   addition, more attention should be given to the selection of reanalysis
   to represent surface climate in the TP, since topographical differences
   between grid points and stations, and other reanalysis model differences
   such as surface land schemes, cause differences in trend identification
   and patterns in this critical region. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Trends in surface air temperature and temperature extremes in the Great

Abstract = {We analyzed trends in surface air temperature and temperature extremes
   in the Great Basin during 1901-2010. We found that annual average daily
   minimum temperature increased significantly (0.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C)
   during the study period, with daily maximum temperature increasing only
   slightly. The asymmetric increase in daily minimum and maximum
   temperature resulted in daily diurnal temperature range (DTR) decreasing
   significantly from 1901 to 2010. Seasonally, increases in daily minimum
   temperature and decreases in DTR occurred in winter, summer, and autumn,
   but the rate of increase was faster in winter. In contrast, daily
   maximum temperature showed no significant trend in any season. These
   trends in temperature measures, however, were not monotonic with decadal
   periods that included either reversal or acceleration of century-scale
   trends. The trend magnitudes in temperatures were not significantly
   associated with elevations. Increases in daily minimum temperature
   resulted in a decrease in the number of frost days (-0.14 +/- 0.04 day
   yr(-1)) and cool nights (-0.09 +/- 0.04 night yr-1) from 1901 to 2010,
   while the number of warm days (0.11 +/- 0.04 day yr-1) and warm nights
   (0.19 +/- 0.03 night yr(-1)) increased significantly. Surprisingly, the
   number of cool days and the length of the growing season showed no
   significant trend during the study period. Thus, the results of this
   study suggest that continuation of the overall warming trend would lead
   to markedly warmer conditions in upcoming decades.},

Abstract = {Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) predictions have a wide range of
   applications. Improving forecasts on this time-scale has therefore
   become a major effort. To evaluate their performance, these forecasts
   are routinely compared to a reference that forecasts the climatological
   distribution at any given time. This distribution is commonly assumed to
   be stationary over the verification period on time-scales longer than
   the seasonal cycle. However, there are prominent deviations from this
   assumption, especially considering trends associated with climate
   change. By employing synthetic forecast-verification pairs, we show that
   estimates of the probabilistic skill of both continuous and categorical
   forecasts increase as a function of the variance explained by the trend
   over the verification period, even when there are errors in the trends
   simulated by the forecasts. We also show this skill enhancement due to
   the trend in the ECMWF extended-range ensemble prediction system. We
   demonstrate that the effects on the skill in an operational forecast
   setting are currently strongest in the Tropics. Our results show that
   care needs to be taken when evaluating forecasts that are subject to
   non-stationarity on time-scales much longer than the forecast
   verification window. This is especially important for determining the
   skill of categorical forecasts, where assumptions on the stationarity of
   the climatology enter both in the reference forecast and in the
   determination of the category thresholds. The results presented in this
   study are not exclusive to the S2S time-scale but have wider
   implications for forecast verification on seasonal to decadal
   time-scales, where the existence of trends can further impact forecast
   skill.},

Abstract = {This work examines some aspects of sugarcane bagasse pyrolysis. Fixed
   bed pyrolysis was performed varying the final process temperature.
   Product yields and the variation of quality properties (calorific
   values) of bio-oil, biochar, and non-condensable gas were investigated.
   A mathematical model to simulate the trend of temperature that maximizes
   a marginal gain was developed considering the regression equations for
   yields and prices of products (related to market prices and calorific
   value of conventional fuels) and for the amount of biomass used to
   supply energy to the process. Two methodologies were adopted to
   calculate the optimum process temperature. The results showed very close
   temperatures (600 and 602 degrees C) for the best performing simulations
   of endogenous and fixed prices methods, with little difference between
   the yields of products, but with good variation between the marginal
   gains (\$124.9/tonne and \$129.8/tonne). Finally, the results of
   endogenous prices method for the fixed bed reactor were compared to the
   vacuum and fast pyrolysis reactors.},

Pages = {537-546},
Abstract = {Changes in global mean sea surface temperature may have potential
   negative implications for natural and socioeconomic systems; however,
   measurements to predict trends in different regions have been limited
   and sometimes contradictory. In this study, an assessment of sea surface
   temperature change signals in the seas off Mexico is presented and
   compared to other regions and the world ocean, and to selected basin
   scale climatic indices of the North Pacific, the Atlantic and the
   tropical Pacific variability. We identified eight regions with different
   exposure to climate variability: In the Pacific, the west coast of the
   Baja California peninsula with mostly no trend, the Gulf of California
   with a modest cooling trend during the last 20 to 25 years, the oceanic
   area with the most intense recent cooling trend, the southern part
   showing an intense warming trend, and a band of no trend setting the
   boundary between North-Pacific and tropical-Pacific variability
   patterns; in the Atlantic, the northeast Gulf of Mexico shows cooling,
   while the western Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean have been warming for
   more than three decades. Potential interactions with fisheries and
   coastal sensitive ecosystems are discussed.},

Year = {2004},
Volume = {31},

Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Regional patterns in tropospheric and sea surface temperature (SST)
   trends are examined for the period 1979-2001 using MSU, NCEP-NCAR, ECMWF
   reanalyses, NOAA OI SST, and the CARDS radiosonde data set. Trends are
   estimated using a nonparametric approach. Substantial regional
   variability in temperature trends is seen in all data sets, with the
   magnitude of the variability (including substantial regions with cooling
   trends) far exceeding the average warming trend. The global analyses
   from MSU and reanalyses are used to identify sampling problems in using
   radiosonde network to infer global trends. Analysis of tropospheric
   temperature trends concurrent with trends in SST shows regions where the
   signs disagree for both surface cooling and warming. Interpretation of
   these differing trends using the reanalyses suggest that the models used
   for the reanalyses are simulating the necessary dynamics/thermodynamics
   that could lead to a tropospheric cooling in contrast to a surface
   warming (and vice versa).},

   to define a population-weighted temperature trend. This method has the

   the population distribution and the trend in the temperature. I show
   that the trend in the global area-weighted average surface air
   temperature is different in key details from the population-weighted
   trend. I extend the index to include urbanization and the urban heat
   island effect. This substantially changes the trend again. I further
   extend the index to include international migration, but this has a
   minor impact on the trend.},

Abstract = {The present study intends to show the effect of climate change on trends
   and patterns of temperature over the southwestern part of Iran. The
   research has been divided into two parts. The first part consists of an
   analysis of the temperature trends of mean temperature (TM), maximum
   temperature (TMAX), and minimum temperature (TMIN) over 39 stations in
   the study region for the period 1950-2007. The trends in these
   parameters were detected by linear regression, and significance was
   tested by t test. Mann-Kendall rank test (MK test) was also employed to
   confirm the results. The second part of the research involved future
   projection of temperature based on four models. The models used were
   Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques, European Center Hamburg
   Model, Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, and UK
   Meteorological Office. Temperature projections were done under B1 and
   A1B emissions scenarios. The analysis of temperature trends revealed a
   significant increase during summer and spring seasons. TMAX was stable
   than TMIN and TM, and winter was stable as compared with summer, spring,
   and autumn seasons. Results of modeling showed that temperature may
   increase between 1.69 and 6.88 A degrees C by 2100 in the study area.
   Summer temperatures may increase with higher rates than spring, winter,
   and autumn temperatures.},

Abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) can cause irreversible damage to marine
   ecosystems and livelihoods. Appropriate MHW characterization remains
   difficult, because the choice of a sea surface temperature (SST)
   temporal baseline strongly influences MHW identification. Following a
   recent work suggesting that there should be a communicating baseline for
   long-term ocean temperature trends (LTT) and MHWs, we provided an
   effective and quantitative solution to calculate LTT and MHWs
   simultaneously by using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)
   method. The long-term nonlinear trend of SST obtained by EEMD shows
   superiority over the traditional linear trend in that the data extension
   does not alter prior results. The MHWs identified from the detrended SST
   data exhibited low sensitivity to the baseline choice, demonstrating the
   robustness of our method. We also derived the total heat exposure (THE)
   by combining LTT and MHWs. The THE was sensitive to the fixed-period
   baseline choice, with a response to increasing SST that depended on the
   onset time of a perpetual MHW state (identified MHW days equal to the
   year length). Subtropical areas, the Indian Ocean, and part of the
   Southern Ocean were most sensitive to the long-term global warming
   trend.},

Abstract = {The seasonality of the 21st century trends in tropical lower
   stratospheric temperature (LST) is examined in simulations by a group of
   comprehensive chemistry-climate models. In contrast to the past LST
   trends, there is robust seasonal dependence among ensembles of the same
   model. Furthermore, most models show strongest cooling around
   July-September and minimal cooling in February-March, which results in a
   weakening of the seasonality in tropical LST. Sensitivity simulations
   with isolated forcing reveal that greenhouse gas increases dominate the
   future tropical LST trend. This seasonally varying LST trend is linked
   to changes in the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC). The BDC can influence
   the LST through direct dynamical heating/cooling and indirect radiative
   effects primarily from ozone changes due to vertical transport. The
   latter is found to be the main cause for the seasonality of the 21st
   century LST trend, while it is difficult to separate them in the past.},

Abstract = {Monthly mean data collected for a 90 year period (1901-1990) have been
   used to study long term water temperature trends at 10 river sites in
   Austria. Significant increases in monthly mean values were evident over
   the study period for seven river stations, but the magnitude of the rise
   Varied from 0.47 to 1.26 degrees C and its pattern was not uniform
   between catchments. River temperature trends for individual months also
   ranged from increases of >2.5 degrees C, through no significant change,
   to decreases of > 1.0 degrees C. Rises in water temperature during the
   twentieth century appear to reflect, at least in part, the increasing
   impact of human activity on Austrian rivers. Progressive regulation of
   main rivers, such as the Danube and Inn, has resulted in strong
   increases in mean water temperatures during the low flow period of
   autumn but not in the summer months when high flows generally occur.
   Different trends were evident for sites closer to glacial runoff
   sources, for catchments containing a large proportion of lakes, and for
   stations influenced by point source discharges and other local factors.
   Rising mean water temperatures at the end of the study period were
   related more to the occurrence of mild winters than to the incidence of
   particularly hot summers.},

Abstract = {Arctic temperature trends in four tropospheric layers during the period
   1958-1986 are examined through analysis of a comprehensive archive of
   Arctic upper air meteorological data. The goals of the study are to
   describe the trends in Arctic tropospheric temperatures and to provide
   verification data for model simulations of Arctic and global climate.
   This analysis extends the work of previous researchers by examining
   rawinsonde time series from a much denser distribution of stations than
   was previously available and by resolving the vertical distribution of
   tropospheric temperatures as well. Absolute trends of 3-degrees-C/30yr
   or larger were found, with both cooling and warming tendencies observed
   in all layers. The majority of the trends, however, are not
   statistically significant. Considerable regional and seasonal
   variability is observed. Trends at many stations in Eurasia and
   Greenland are highly sensitive to large positive anomalies during the
   period 1958-1963, which may be artifacts of the data. On the basis of
   our analysis, we conclude that greenhouse-induced warming is not
   detectable in the Arctic troposphere for the 1958-1986 period.},

Abstract = {Air temperatures in the Western Mediterranean area exhibited a positive
   trend during the last 40 years, whilst the Eastern Mediterranean area
   showed a decrease. The mean temperature of the surface/500 hPa layer
   exhibited a positive trend in both the Western and Eastern
   Mediterranean. This almost continuous increase of mean temperature is
   partly due to horizontal ther-mal advection and mainly to diabatic
   warming. Sea surface temperatures show a negative trend throughout the
   Mediterranean area. The time series of sea surface temperatures in the
   Eastern Mediterranean show evidence of 48- and 54-month harmonics, while
   the time series in the Western Mediterranean show evidence of 28- or

Abstract = {Attempts have been-made to study the temporal variations and trends in
   monthly, seasonal and annual temperature over two stations-Agartala and
   Kailashahar in Tripura, India for the period 1969 to 2014. Analysis has
   been carried for four temperature indices, namely - minimum temperature
   (T-min), maximum temperature (T-max), mean temperature (T-mean) and
   diurnal temperature range (DTR). Non -parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test
   was used to detect the trends and the magnitude of the trends were
   determined with Sen's estimator of slope. The analysis of the
   temperature data revealed significant increasing trends in T-min, T-max
   and T-mcan variables at both the stations on annual scale, while
   decreasing trend in DTR was significant over Agartala only. On the
   seasonal scale, the increasing (decreasing) trends were observed in
   T-min, T-max and T-mean, (DTR) temperature indices in all the four
   seasons - winter, pre -monsoon, monsoon and post -monsoon except
   non-significant decreasing trend in T-max, in winter season over
   Agatala. On the monthly scale, significant rising trends in T-min,T-max
   and T-mean were observed in the most of the months and significant
   decreasing trend in DTR was found only in the months of January and
   December.},

   flowing upward in the thin space between the blocks and duct. This
   geometry combined with the small coolant flow rates and gamma energy
   deposition rates cause the coolant temperature distributions to be
   greatly affected by intersubassembly heat transfers. Reported are
   calculated trends of the coolant temperatures in the six facial
   intraduct gaps of radial reflector subassemblies surrounding a

Abstract = {Tropospheric temperatures in the Antarctic are retrieved by linearly
   combining satellite-borne Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) channels 2 and 4
   observations. We show good agreement between satellite-inferred
   temperature trends and radiosonde observations. It is illustrated that
   the Antarctic troposphere has cooled in the summer and fall seasons
   since 1979, in agreement with Thompson and Solomon ( 2002). It is shown
   that significant tropospheric warming prevails during Antarctic winters
   and springs, but we also find significant winter cooling over half of
   East Antarctica. We find the largest winter tropospheric warming of
   about 0.6 K/decade for 1979 - 2005 between 120 degrees W and 180 degrees
   W. Homogeneous winter tropospheric warming over Antarctica from the
   ERA-40 reanalysis is not supported by the MSU observations. While MSU
   stratospheric temperatures exhibit the expected large cooling during the
   spring and summer seasons, we also find large stratospheric warming over
   half the southern hemisphere high latitudes in the winter and spring
   seasons.},

Abstract = {Many components operating at high temperatures need additional
   protection to resist the aggressive environment This is usually provided
   by coatings which impart excellent corrosion resistance by forming a
   protective alumina, chromia or silica scales. The requirement of coating
   varies from one application to the other, depending upon the
   environment, whether it is oxidising, sulphidizing or in the presence of
   salt deposits. The coatings at high temperatures. must have low reaction
   rates with the environment, and also remain adherent and form protective
   oxides at the temperature of operation. Most of these coatings are
   divided into three main categories, conventional coatings, modified
   coatings and advanced coatings. Conventional coatings such as aluminide,
   silicides very commonly fail in aggressive environments. Advanced
   coatings are by vacuum plasma method, HVOF, laser surface alloying,
   plasma powder welding and ion beam assisted coatings. Laser surface
   alloying is being considered as the most versatile technique which can
   be used to make high performance surface alloys. This helps in saving
   huge cost of costly materials, which are un-necessarily used in bulk
   alloying as well as the processing does not interfere with the bulk
   properties.},

Abstract = {We quantify the effect of the snow-albedo feedback on Swiss spring
   temperature trends using daily temperature and snow depth measurements
   from six station pairs for the period 1961-2011. We show that the daily
   mean 2-m temperature of a spring day without snow cover is on average
   0.4 A degrees C warmer than one with snow cover at the same location.
   This estimate is comparable with estimates from climate modelling
   studies. Caused by the decreases in snow pack, the snow-albedo feedback
   amplifies observed temperature trends in spring. The influence is small
   and confined to areas around the upward-moving snow line in spring and
   early summer. For the 1961-2011 period, the related temperature trend
   increases are in the order of 3-7 \% of the total observed trend.},

Abstract = {Karachi is the largest city of Pakistan. The temperature change in
   Karachi is studied in this research by analyzing the time series data of
   mean maximum temperature (MMxT), mean minimum temperature (MMiT) and
   mean annual temperature (MAT) from 1947 to 2005 (59 years). Data is
   analyzed in three parts by running linear regression and by taking
   anomalies of all time periods: (a) whole period from 1947-2005; (b)
   phase one 1947-1975 and (c) phase two 1976-2005. During 1947 to 2005
   MMxT has increased about 4.6A degrees C, MMiT has no change and MAT has
   increased 2.25A degrees C. During 1947-1975, MMxT increased 1.9A degrees
   C, in this period there is -aEuro parts per thousand 1.3A degrees C
   decrease in MMiT and MAT has raised upto 0.3A degrees C. During
   1976-2005, the MMxT, MMiT and MAT increased 2.7A degrees C, 1.2A degrees
   C and 1.95A degrees C, respectively. The analysis shows significantly
   the role of extreme vulnerability of MMxT in rising the temperature of
   Karachi than the MMiT.},

Abstract = {Observations at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, established the
   systematic increase of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. For the same
   reasons that this site provides excellent globally averaged CO2 data, it
   may provide temperature data with global significance. Here, we examine
   hourly temperature records, averaged annually for 1977-2006, to
   determine linear trends as a function of time of day. For night-time
   data (22:00 to 06:00 LST (local standard time)) there is a near-uniform
   warming of 0.040 degrees C yr(-1). During the day, the linear trend
   shows a slight cooling of -0.014 degrees C yr(-1) at 12:00 LST (noon).
   Overall, at Mauna Loa Observatory, there is a mean warming trend of
   0.021 degrees C yr(-1). The dominance of night-time warming results in a
   relatively large annual decrease in the diurnal temperature range (DTR)
   of -0.050 degrees C yr(-1) over the period 1977-2006. These trends are
   consistent with the observed increases in the concentrations of CO2 and
   its role as a greenhouse gas (demonstrated here by first-order radiative
   forcing calculations), and indicate the possible relevance of the Mauna
   Loa temperature measurements to global warming.},

Abstract = {Eighteen stations are considered for the study of climatic records over
   Turkey in search for possible trends. Mean, unfiltered, seasonal and
   annual maximum and minimum temperatures are analysed using the
   Mann-Kendall rank statistic to demonstrate any existence of possible
   trends.
   The analyses indicate that the mean annual temperature records in Turkey
   have a warming trend over the 1939 to 1989 period, but a cooling trend
   from 1955 to 1989. These trends in mean annual temperatures, however,
   are not statistically significant. Comparatively greater warming effects
   have occurred in spring and winter minimum rather than the maximum
   temperature records. A regional increase in the mean minimum temperature
   around 1955 is attributed to the urban heat island effect. In general,
   general circulation models (GCM) predictions are consistent with the
   sign of the trends only in Turkish climate records during the entire
   1939 to 1989 period. (C) 1977 by the Royal Meteorological Society.},

Abstract = {Changes in atmospheric temperature have a particular importance in
   climate research because climate models consistently predict a
   distinctive vertical profile of trends. With increasing greenhouse gas
   concentrations, the surface and troposphere are consistently projected
   to warm, with an enhancement of that warming in the tropical upper
   troposphere. Hence, attempts to detect this distinct `fingerprint' have
   been a focus for observational studies. The topic acquired heightened
   importance following the 1990 publication of an analysis of satellite
   data which challenged the reality of the projected tropospheric warming.
   This review documents the evolution over the last four decades of
   understanding of tropospheric temperature trends and their likely
   causes. Particular focus is given to the difficulty of producing
   homogenized datasets, with which to derive trends, from both radiosonde
   and satellite observing systems, because of the many systematic changes
   over time. The value of multiple independent analyses is demonstrated.
   Paralleling developments in observational datasets, increased computer
   power and improved understanding of climate forcing mechanisms have led
   to refined estimates of temperature trends from a wide range of climate
   models and a better understanding of internal variability. It is
   concluded that there is no reasonable evidence of a fundamental
   disagreement between tropospheric temperature trends from models and
   observations when uncertainties in both are treated comprehensively. (c)

Title = {Shifting Hardiness Zones: Trends in Annual Minimum Temperature},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Work published in 2012 revealed that annual minimum temperatures over
   the coterminous United States (USA) have increased faster than mean
   temperatures, causing a pronounced poleward shift in the positions of
   hardiness zones defined by the expected annual minimum temperature.
   Here, estimates of increases in annual minimum temperatures are updated
   and extended to other land areas where station temperature records are
   available. Annual minimum temperatures have increased faster than mean
   temperatures in seasonally cold regions globally, but have warmed at
   about the same rate as mean temperatures in tropical climates. The mean
   increase in annual minimum temperature across the available weather
   stations was 2.0 degrees C between 1970 and 2016 (or almost 0.5 degrees
   C per decade), as compared to an increase of 1.2 degrees C in mean
   temperature. Recent cold winters in regions such as Eastern North
   America did not clearly break with this trend and were within the range
   of variability seen in past decades. Overall, annual minimum
   temperatures appear to be increasing steadily, though with considerable
   inter-annual variability.},

Abstract = {Over the last three decades, ozone depletion over Antarctica has
   affected temperature and winds in the lower stratosphere, and even in
   the troposphere and at the surface. The second Chemistry Climate Model
   Validation activity (CCMVal2) concluded that chemistry-climate models
   simulate stratospheric cooling that is too large compared to
   observations, even though the modeled and observed ozone trends are
   similar. However, these comparisons were based only on radiosonde data
   available for 1969-1998. Here, we investigate trends in the Southern
   Hemisphere polar cap in the latest version of the Community Earth System
   Model (CESM1) with its high-top atmospheric component, WACCM4, fully
   coupled to an ocean model. We compare model trends with observations for
   different periods and with other modeling studies to show much better
   agreement with more recent data, and conclude that the discrepancy
   between observed trends and those calculated by high-top models may not
   be as large as previously reported. Citation: Calvo, N., R. R. Garcia,

   were homogenized in order to eliminate the effects of non-climatic
   factors. Then, three trend models (linear, piecewise and sloped steps)
   were applied and the trends of mean temperature and average minimum and

   estimated. The results indicate a negative trend for the period
   1961-1981, a more pronounced positive trend from 1981 to 2004, and an

Abstract = {In this work, the annual trends in absolute and maximum air temperature
   of six conventional meteorological stations of the National Institute of
   Meteorology - INMET, located in the state of Tocantins, for the period
   from 1961 to 2017 were investigated. The trend analysis was performed
   using the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test. The results indicate a
   significant trend of increasing the maximum annual temperature in all
   seasons. The annual minimum temperature also showed a positive trend,
   but with statistical significance only for the Porto Nacional, Palmas
   and Taguatinga stations. Although there are differences in trends
   between seasons, there was a systematic increase in maximum and minimum
   temperature, especially from the 90s. The highest rate of temperature
   growth was registered at Palmas station, from 4.14 degrees C to the
   minimum and 3.68 degrees C for the maximum, over a period of 23 years.
   The increase in the minimum temperature found in this work shows that
   these cities are going through a process of greater energy retention in
   the form of sensitive heat during the night, possibly due to the
   replacement of the Earth's surface coverage, due to the greater
   difficulty in exchanging energy between the surface and the atmosphere.},

Title = {Mesospheric temperature trends at mid-latitudes in summer},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {The Leibniz-Institute Middle Atmosphere Model LIMA is used to study
   mesospheric temperature trends in summer during the last 5 decades
   (1961-2009). In order to account for realistic atmospheric conditions
   LIMA adapts several observational data sets, namely a) tropospheric and
   stratospheric temperatures and winds from ECMWF at heights 0-35 km, b)
   daily Lyman-alpha fluxes, c) monthly carbon dioxide concentrations since
   1961, and d) annual total ozone from ground-based data for 1964-1978 and
   monthly ozone profiles up to 0.60 hPa from satellites since 1979. This
   paper presents a comparison of simulated temperature trends with a)
   ground-based observations of lidar temperatures at 44 degrees N, b)
   phase height measurements at mid-latitudes (51 degrees N), and c)
   temperature trends derived from satellite data. In general there is
   excellent agreement between trends from LIMA and observations. Cooling
   in the mesosphere is on the order of 2-4 K/decade. The magnitude of the
   mesospheric temperature trend varies during the last five decades. In
   particular, the period from 1979-1997 shows large mesospheric cooling of
   3-5 K/decade. This large cooling is primarily caused by long-term
   changes of ozone in the upper stratosphere in combination with a CO2
   increase. For the first time, modeling of mesospheric temperature trends

Title = {Twentieth century tropical sea surface temperature trends revisited},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAY 18},
Abstract = {This study compares the global distribution of 20th century SST and
   marine air temperature trends from a wide variety of data sets including
   un-interpolated archives as well as globally-complete reconstructions.
   Apart from the eastern equatorial Pacific, all datasets show consistency
   in their statistically significant trends, with warming everywhere
   except the far northwestern Atlantic; the largest warming trends are
   found in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres. Two of the SST
   reconstructions exhibit statistically significant cooling trends over
   the eastern equatorial Pacific, in disagreement with the un-interpolated
   SST and marine air temperature datasets which show statistically
   significant warming in this region. Twentieth century trends in tropical
   marine cloudiness, precipitation and SLP from independent data sets
   provide physically consistent evidence for a reduction in the strength
   of the atmospheric Walker Circulation accompanied by an eastward shift
   of deep convection from the western to the central equatorial Pacific.

Abstract = {Regional trends in recent temperature indices in China were analyzed
   from daily surface air temperature maxima and minima at about 498
   stations during 1961 to 2000. Some indices based on percentile and those
   modified by previous studies were used, and linear trends were analyzed
   for different regions in this study. Results show significant changes in
   important temperature indices over the past 40 yr, especially in
   northern China, the Yangtze River valleys and Xinjiang. Trends of
   decreasing diurnal temperature range were found in mainland China as a
   whole during 1961 to 2000, with stronger decreases in Northeast China,
   central South China and the Xinjiang region. There is a trend of cool
   days significantly decreasing in the middle latitudes near 40degreesC
   along the Yellow River valley. There are trends of increasing warm days
   in the upper-middle Yellow River valley and other regions such as along
   the coast of South China, while there are decreasing trends scattered in
   the central part of East China. The number of frost days decreased
   significantly in most of mainland China. Consecutive warm days
   significantly increased in northern China, while consecutive cold days
   decreased largely in Xinjiang, the Yellow River valley, the southern
   part of northeast China, and along the southeast coast of the country.
   In examining the seasonal contribution, cool nights largely decreased in
   winter as a whole and the linear trend is about -2.5 to -5 d/10 yr.
   Another contribution of cool nights comes from summer except for the
   region of the mid-low Yangtze River valley. The contribution of warm
   days is attributed to the higher temperature in winter over northern
   China and in summer over western China and along the coast of South
   China but a decreasing trend is noted in the basins of the Yangtze and
   Huaihe Rivers. These trends of temperature indices may be caused by
   climate factors, such as more rainfall in the Yangtze River basin and
   dry climate along the Yellow River valley, and non-climate factors, such
   as urbanization and industrial aerosols.},

Title = {Temperature and heat wave trends in northwest Mexico},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {20-26},
Abstract = {Increase in temperature extremes is one of the main expected impacts of
   climate change, as well as one of the first signs of its occurrence.
   Nevertheless, results emerging from General Circulation Models, while
   sufficient for large scales, are not enough for forecasting local trends
   and, hence, the IPCC has called for local studies based on on-site data.
   Indeed, it is expected that climate extremes will be detected much
   earlier than changes in climate averages. Heat waves are among the most
   important and least studied climate extremes, however its occurrence has
   been only barely studied and even its very definition remains
   controversial. This paper discusses the observed changes in temperature
   trends and heat waves in Northwestern Mexico, one of the most vulnerable
   regions of the country. The climate records in two locations of the
   region are analyzed, including one of the cities with extreme climate in
   Mexico, Mexicali City in the state of Baja California and the Yaqui
   River basin at Sonora State using three different methodologies. Results
   showed clear trends on temperature increase and occurrence of heat waves
   in both of the study zones using the three methodologies proposed. As
   result, some policy making suggestion are included in order to increase
   the adaptability of the studied regions to climate change, particularly
   related with heat wave occurrence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This study summarizes 53 years of radiosonde measurements at the
   MeteoSwiss Aerological Station of Payerne, Switzerland. The temperature
   time series is the result of a careful reassessment of the original
   data, mainly based on the internal station documentation. Comparisons
   with HadAT2 and RAOBCORE/RICH adjusted data sets document the high
   quality of our technical reevaluation. In the lower troposphere, we
   compare radiosonde measurement trends to independently homogenized
   surface trends measured at lowland and Alpine stations up to 3580 m. We
   find an average difference among trends below 0.03 K/decade (7-8\%),
   showing consistency between upper air and surface temperature
   measurements. Upper air data show the 0 degrees C isotherm to rise by
   about 70 m/decade on average over the whole period, which is consistent
   with the 60 m/decade trend found using surface measurements. A similar
   change has also been measured for the tropopause height, which rose by
   54 m/decade over the last five decades. Analysis of the phase and
   amplitude of the diurnal temperature cycle shows a strongly decreasing
   amplitude with height from about 3 K at the surface to 0.2 K at 700 hPa.
   The diurnal cycle peaks at about 15 UTC at the surface and shifts to
   later hours with height, reaching almost midnight at 400 hPa. In the
   stratosphere, diurnal temperature again peaks at around 15 UTC, but with
   low amplitude. Annual temperature cycle amplitude is in the order of 15
   K and fairly constant with height. The peak temperature, however, shifts
   from July-August in the troposphere to June-July in the stratosphere.
   Temperature trends in the troposphere exhibit a clear warming trend
   since the 1980s, which decreases with height and changes to a cooling
   trend in the stratosphere, with no trend or minor warming since the end
   of the 1990s. The warming in the troposphere is found to be larger
   during summer months, whereas the cooling in the stratosphere is larger
   during winter months.},

Volume = {46},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent years, it has been noticeable that indoor temperatures in
   residential buildings have followed three trends: decreasing spatial
   variation, decreasing temporal variation and simultaneously increasing
   mean levels of indoor temperature. At the same time, architectural
   design and the construction technologies applied in new buildings and
   building renovation have undergone a change. In addition, what is
   considered an appropriate indoor temperature level has changed over
   time. This is reflected both in quotes from the technical literature and
   in the requirements set in standards. Research suggests that such
   changing indoor temperature patterns are associated with unintended
   interactions in the following main areas: human health and resilience,
   human indoor climate perception, environmental impacts of buildings, and
   resilience of buildings in a changing climate. Possible explanations lie
   in considering the interplay of techno-cultural factors, techno-physical
   building factors, occupant behavioural factors, physiological adaptation
   factors and psychological factors, rather than considering any one of
   these factors individually. This leads to the question of whether the
   established ways of thinking in building planning and operation should
   remain unchanged in the future. The article concludes with suggestions
   for adapting these approaches to support such a discussion.},

Abstract = {Southeast Brazil has great economic importance for Brazil and is highly
   vulnerable to extreme events like floods and droughts. Studies have
   shown an increase of temperature in this region. Using a new detection
   and attribution framework (Ribes et al., 2017, ) and Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models, this change is found to be
   largely due to greenhouse gases. We estimate that greenhouse gases
   contribute a warming of 0.95 to 1.5 degrees C to the observed warming
   trend of 1.1 degrees C between 1955 and 2004. Temperature changes from
   natural and nongreenhouse gas anthropogenic forcing are estimated to be
   small over this period. Results are robust using different time windows.
   Using the Community Earth System Model ensembles to evaluate the impacts
   of internal variability, observational and model error shows that most
   uncertainty arises from model error.
   Plain Language Summary Southeast Brazil has great economic importance
   for Brazil and is highly vulnerable to extreme events like floods,
   droughts, and heat waves. Many studies link those kind of events with an
   increase in temperature due to climate change, largely caused by
   increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. This study
   tested whether or not human-induced climate change is responsible for
   the observed increase in temperature in Southeast Brazil. The observed
   1.1 degrees C per 50-year trend is largely due to increasing greenhouse
   gases, which means that they have a significant role in observed changes
   in Southeast Brazilian temperatures.},

Abstract = {Long-term satellite passive microwave brightness temperature trends,
   supported by short-term automatic weather station (AWS) temperature
   data, show that the Greenland Summit area experiences secondary warm
   periods in the late fall and/or winter as well as primary midsummer
   warmth. High-resolution isotope profiles from snow pits dug in 1989,
   1990, and 1991 near the Greenland Ice Sheet Project II (GISP2) site
   reveal that stable isotope ratios (delta(18)O and delta D) preserve this
   distinctive temperature cycle. This indicates that snow accumulation
   occurs frequently through the year at the Greenland Summit and that the
   isotope record initially contains temperature information from many
   times of the year. Through an empirically derived emissivity model using
   AWS air temperature data and satellite microwave brightness
   temperatures, our approach allows isotope values preserved in the snow
   to be related to estimated near-surface air temperatures.
   Density-corrected profiles allow the amounts and timing of accumulation
   to be determined as well. Our results indicate that stable isotope
   ratios from the near-surface snow at the Greenland Summit are currently
   a reliable, high-resolution temperature proxy. This result increases
   confidence in the paleoclimatic interpretation of isotope signal
   variations in the GISP2 and Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) deep ice
   cores.},

Abstract = {The Eastern Mediterranean region is a major climate change hotspot. The
   island of Cyprus is likely to face increases in the frequency and
   intensity of hotter weather conditions and heatwaves in the near future.
   Studies conducted on the long-term temperature changes in Cyprus are
   very limited. Here, we present an updated and most detailed assessment
   of the maximum, minimum, mean and diurnal temperature series in North
   Cyprus for the period 1975-2021. Data obtained from the meterological
   stations of North Cyprus have been analysed using Mann-Kendal (MK) test
   and Theil-Sen slope estimator. Overall the mean minimum temperature
   trend (Tmin) showed the highest warming rate 0.61 (0.24 <= Tmin <=
   0.99)degrees C decade-1 followed by the mean temperature trend (Tmean)
   0.38 (0.29 <= Tmean <= 0.50) degrees C decade-1 and the mean maximum
   temperature trend (Tmax) 0.28 (0 <= Tmax <= 0.50) degrees C decade-1.
   The magnitude of the warming trend observed in the overall mean minimum
   temperature of North Cyprus 0.61 degrees C decade-1, is one of the
   fastest warming trends reported in the literature. A negative
   association was detected between the direction of prevailing winds of
   North Cyprus and the magnitude of increase in the mean temperature
   trends of the locations with coastal Mediterranean climate, which has
   pointed out the importance of prevailing winds regarding their cooling
   effect in coastal areas. The diurnal temperature range trend of North
   Cyprus indicates an apparent decrease (- 0.33 degrees C decade-1). The
   warming impact of urban heat island effect was detected in temperature
   trends of Nicosia in the Mesaoria plain. The information provided here
   is invaluable to consider in any climate assessment and adaptation plan
   in Cyprus. If the current warming trend persists into the future, it
   will devastatingly impact all sectors and natural systems in the region.},

Title = {Global temperature evolution: recent trends and some pitfalls},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Global surface temperatures continue to rise. In most surface
   temperature data sets, the years 2014, 2015 and again 2016 set new
   global heat records since the start of regular measurements. Never
   before have three record years occurred in a row. We show that this
   recent streak of record heat does not in itself provide statistical
   evidence for an acceleration of global warming, nor was it preceded by a
   `slowdown period' with a significantly reduced rate of warming. Rather,
   the data are fully consistent with a steady global warming trend since
   the 1970s, superimposed with random, stationary, short-term variability.
   All recent variations in short-term trends are well within what was to
   be expected, based on the observed warming trend and the observed
   variability from the 1970s up to the year 2000. We discuss some pitfalls
   of statistical analysis of global temperatures which have led to
   incorrect claims of an unexpected or significant warming slowdown.},

Abstract = {Climatic change is one of the most important issues of present times.
   Unlike the greenhouse gases, which have a predominantly warming effect,
   atmospheric aerosols could either warm or cool the atmosphere depending
   upon the size, distribution and optical properties. Of all the climatic
   elements, temperature plays a major role in detecting climatic change
   brought about by urbanization and industrialization. This paper,
   therefore, attempts to study temporal variation in temperature over Pune
   city, India, during the period 1901-2000. The long-term change in
   temperature has been evaluated by Mann-Kendall rank statistics and
   linear trend. The analysis reveals significant decrease in mean annual
   and mean maximum temperature. This decrease in temperature is more
   pronounced during the winter season, which can be ascribed to a
   significant increase in the amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM)
   in the ambient air during the last decade. On the contrary, monsoon
   season shows warming. This warming can be attributed to a significant
   increase in the low cloud amount. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In this Review, we summarize the work in the last ten years on the
   development of fluorescent molecular probes with possible applications
   in microscopic thermometry. We discuss four principal types of
   temperature-dependent photoluminescence features: 1) Emission intensity;
   2) Ratio of emission intensities; 3) Emission peak shift; and 4)
   Emission lifetime. We compare the advantages, limitations, and
   challenges of the different probes using these types of sensing
   mechanisms. By focusing on molecular probes, rather than nanoparticles
   or polymers, the mechanisms of temperature dependence are discussed
   thoroughly, with the most common including twisted intramolecular charge
   transfer (TICT), aggregation-induced emission (AIE), and mechanically
   induced change in emission (MICE). With many different confounding
   variables associated with each experimental method and mechanism of
   temperature-dependent photoluminescence, lanthanide and transition metal
   complexes seem to be promising candidates for future microscopic
   thermometry applications.},

Abstract = {Classical assessments of temperature trends are based on the analysis of
   a small number of time series. Considering trend to be only smooth
   changes of the mean value of a stochastic process through time is
   limiting, because it does not provide a mechanism to study changes of
   the mean that could also occur over space. Thus, in studies of climate
   there is a substantial interest in being able to jointly characterize
   temperature trends over time and space. In this article we build
   wavelet-based space-time hierarchical Bayesian models that can be used
   to simultaneously model trend, seasonality, and error, allowing for the
   possibility that the error process may exhibit space-time long-range
   dependence. We demonstrate how these statistical models can be used to
   assess the significance of trend over time and space. We motivate and
   apply our methods to the analysis of space-time temperature trends,
   based on data collected in the last five decades from central Sweden.},

Abstract = {The variability of minimum and maximum temperature and the daily
   temperature range (DTR) in Poland was analyzed on the basis of the data
   from 9 stations with different periods of data (the longest was 98 yr),
   The long-term changes of seasonal means as well as for all Julian days
   were determined. The increase in the minimum temperature was accompanied
   by a slighter increase in the maximum temperature and a decrease in the
   DTR. It was found that the DTR changes correlate well with cloudiness,
   and the extreme temperature changes are related to the NAO (North
   Atlantic Oscillation) intensity, especially during winter and spring.
   The analysis of intra-annual changes has shown that the strongest
   increase in the minimum and maximum temperatures occurs in mid- and late
   winter, but there are also periods with decreasing tendencies, i.e. late
   autumn, the beginning of winter and the beginning of summer. All
   temperature indices indicate the cooling in autumn.},

Abstract = {Global climate projections show that rising trends in precipitation very
   probably contribute to the resurgence of the risk of flooding in African
   cities. There remain however uncertainties regarding the patterns of
   change in past and future precipitation in the countries of West Africa.
   There are still too few studies focus on the individual perceptions of
   populations in Africa on these climate changes, although this is an
   essential lever for the implementation of warning systems. The aim of
   present study is to consider in parallel the perceptions of the
   residents of the city of Abidjan re-garding the variability of
   precipitation and the meteorological data. A survey among 503
   individ-uals was carried out at Abidjan in two districts with contrasted
   topographical profiles, socio-economic conditions and exposure to
   flooding, in order to record their perceptions regarding the variations
   in precipitation between 2009 and 2018. The CHIRPS precipitation data
   was used to calculate the trends in the climate indicators with the
   Mann-Kendall method. The results show that there is a similarity between
   the perception of individuals surveyed and an increasing trend in days
   of rainfall of more than 50 mm and intensity of precipitation.},

Abstract = {This paper looks at the level of persistence in the temperature
   anomalies series of 114 European cities. Once this level of persistence
   has been identified, the time trend coefficients are estimated and the
   results indicate that most of the series examined display positive
   trends, supporting thus climate warming. Moreover, the results obtained
   confirm the hypothesis that long-memory behaviour cannot be neglected in
   the study of temperature time series, changing, therefore, the estimated
   effect of global warming.},

Abstract = {There has been considerable debate on the existence of trends in climate
   in the highlands of East Africa and hypotheses about their potential
   effect on the trends in malaria in the region. We apply a new robust
   trend test to mean temperature time series data from three editions of
   the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit database (CRU TS)
   for several relevant locations. We find significant trends in the data
   extracted from newer editions of the database but not in the older
   version for periods ending in 1996. The trends in the newer data are
   even more significant when post-1996 data are added to the samples. We
   also test for trends in the data from the Kericho meteorological station
   prepared by Omumbo et al. We find no significant trend in the 1979-1995
   period but a highly significant trend in the full 1979-2009 sample.
   However, although the malaria cases observed at Kericho, Kenya rose
   during a period of resurgent epidemics (1994-2002) they have since
   returned to a low level. A large assembly of parasite rate surveys from
   the region, stratified by altitude, show that this decrease in malaria
   prevalence is not limited to Kericho.},

Title = {Exploring future trends of precipitation and runoff in arid regions
   under different scenarios based on a bias-corrected CMIP6 model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {630},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Precipitation and runoff changes play a very important role in
   ecosystems and human well-being. Predicting its changes is critical for
   water resource management and coping with climate change. However,
   corresponding studies in arid regions are limited by lack of data and
   poor spatial distribution of meteorological stations. Therefore, this
   study identified the applicability of multi-source meteorological data
   in a typical arid region, the Shiyang River Basin, by comparing its
   variability with measured precipitation. Then, the best applicable
   precipitation product was selected to correct the data of CMIP6, and to
   predict the change of precipitation and runoff under the scenarios of
   SSP126/245/585 by 2100. The results showed that the CMADS dataset was
   more consistent with the measured data than TRMM and CFSR. Through
   Taylor diagram analysis and equidistant cumulative distribution
   functions matching (EDCDF) method bias correction, the GFDL-ESM4 model
   was more suitable for arid regions in terms of precipitation and
   temperature. During 2015-2100, the annual precipitation and average
   annual temperature under each scenario all showed an increasing trend.
   However, the monthly precipitation from May to October showed a
   decreasing trend, indicating an increase in precipitation during spring
   and winter, and a decrease during summer and autumn. The average
   temperature for all months from January to December showed an increasing
   trend. However, in arid regions, the temperature increase is more
   pronounced during colder months (1-3) compared to hotter months (6-9).
   The average annual runoff of SSP126 scenario showed an increasing trend
   from 2015 to 2100 (SSP126: 0.004/yr), while the runoff from the SSP245
   and SSP585 scenarios showed a decreasing trend (SSP245: - 0.031/yr;
   SSPSSP585: -0.084/yr). This is primarily attributed to a small increment
   of precipitation and a larger increment of temperature, an early melting
   of glacial snow and an increasing of evapotranspiration, which in turn
   leads to a reduction in annual runoff. The research can help achieving
   sustainable development, effective management of water resources in arid
   regions, and provide a reference and example for related research in
   high-resolution.},

Title = {North American extreme precipitation events and related large-scale

Abstract = {This paper surveys the current state of knowledge regarding large-scale
   meteorological patterns (LSMPs) associated with short-duration (less
   than 1 week) extreme precipitation events over North America. In
   contrast to teleconnections, which are typically defined based on the
   characteristic spatial variations of a meteorological field or on the
   remote circulation response to a known forcing, LSMPs are defined
   relative to the occurrence of a specific phenomenon-here, extreme
   precipitation-and with an emphasis on the synoptic scales that have a
   primary influence in individual events, have medium-range weather
   predictability, and are well-resolved in both weather and climate
   models. For the LSMP relationship with extreme precipitation, we
   consider the previous literature with respect to definitions and data,
   dynamical mechanisms, model representation, and climate change trends.
   There is considerable uncertainty in identifying extremes based on
   existing observational precipitation data and some limitations in
   analyzing the associated LSMPs in reanalysis data. Many different
   definitions of ``extreme{''} are in use, making it difficult to directly
   compare different studies. Dynamically, several types of meteorological
   systems-extratropical cyclones, tropical cyclones, mesoscale convective
   systems, and mesohighs-and several mechanisms-fronts, atmospheric
   rivers, and orographic ascent-have been shown to be important aspects of
   extreme precipitation LSMPs. The extreme precipitation is often realized
   through mesoscale processes organized, enhanced, or triggered by the
   LSMP. Understanding of model representation, trends, and projections for
   LSMPs is at an early stage, although some promising analysis techniques
   have been identified and the LSMP perspective is useful for evaluating
   the model dynamics associated with extremes.},

Title = {A study on flood runoff of the steppe river based on the modern trends

Journal = {DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY BULLETIN SERIES-GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {38-48},
Abstract = {This study aims to define the quantitative, qualitative and
   spatio-temporal parameters of atmospheric precipitation and the surface
   runoff of rivers within Dnipropetrovsk region using the example of
   Samara River. The specified goal is achieved taking into account the
   problems of keeping and development of the water resource potential in
   Dnipropetrovsk region. At the first stage the survey analyzes the
   features of precipitation formation in Dniproperovsk region. The
   analysis is based on climate data base which includes fifty-six years of
   measurements by nine meteorological stations. The entire monitoring
   period was divided into two parts in order to find the trends of
   precipitation formation. The initial processing allows to confirm that
   there is a rising of moistening at researched region, spatially from
   southwest to northwest, and according to the annual statistics the max
   precipitation shifts to warm seasons of the year. The winter season is
   characterized by longer period of precipitation, contrary to winter,
   there is no changes in summer. Moreover, there are the torrential rains
   in summer and the average rain intensity does not exceed 1 mm per min.
   The probability of events when the rain intensity is more than 1 mm per
   min is about 3\%. It was taking into account during the simulation.
   Nevertheless, one can see that rain type formation transformers into
   tropical one. The next main task of the research was to simulate the
   surface runoff of Samara River using the tool of QGIS- r. sim. water.
   The accuracy and reliability of the result correctness were confirmed by
   actual parameters of Vishnevy stream that placed in the territory of
   water-balance station Balzata (Moldova). As a result, the series of
   themes were created. It reflects the distribution of surface runoff
   parameters within Samara river basin during the warm season. In order to
   optimize the analyze the authors developed an estimation score system
   which is based on the influence of anthropogenic factors. Such solution
   allows to determine that the most problematic (from the ``anthropogenic
   factors influence{''} point of view) regions are placed in the main
   river valley and at the southeast part of the Samara River basin. The
   rest part of the basin is characterized by minor or inessential
   influence of anthropogenic factors. The main anthropogenic factor that
   has the highest level of influence on the river runoff is an
   agricultural activity in the territory of Samara River basin. It affects
   the transformation time. The highest level of anthropogenic influence is
   determined in the middle of summer season, the lowest - in spring and
   autumn.},

Volume = {18},
Number = {11},

Abstract = {Long-term changes in the monthly precipitation along the coastal areas
   of the Sea of Japan are examined using monthly operational observation
   data from the Japan Meteorological Agency. The monthly precipitation in
   December significantly increased from the mid-1980s to 2015, even though
   no remarkable changes were found in January, February, or November.
   Significant positive trends in the December precipitation extend widely
   over the coastal areas of the Sea of Japan, and the amounts increase to
   approximately 50\% of the climatological precipitation in December at
   most observational stations. The interannual variations in other
   variables, including the monthly accumulated actual sunshine duration,
   days with lightning detection, and satellite-retrieved outgoing longwave
   radiation, also show significant trends that are consistent with the
   precipitation increase in December. The effect of the sea surface
   temperature (SST) on precipitation change is discussed based on
   correlation and regression analyses. The interannual variations in the
   December precipitation averaged over the observational stations near the
   Sea of Japan are significantly correlated with the SSTs in the prior
   month (November). However, the SST increase in November is insufficient
   to account for the increase in precipitation. In addition, it was found
   that the satellite-retrieved surface wind speed in December has grown
   stronger in recent years over the Sea of Japan. It is suggested that the
   stronger wind corresponds to the enhanced monsoonal flow and is the
   primary cause of the precipitation increase in December.},

Abstract = {Amorphous materials are high-energy solids that can potentially enhance
   the bioavailability of poorly soluble compounds. A major impediment to
   their widespread use as a formulation platform is the tendency of
   amorphous materials to crystallize. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the relative crystallization tendency of six structural
   analogues belonging to the dihydropyridine class, in an aqueous
   environment in the absence and presence of polymers, using wide-angle
   X-ray scattering synchrotron radiation and polarized light microscopy.
   The crystallization behavior of precipitates generated from
   supersaturated solutions of the active pharmaceutical ingredients was
   found to be highly variable ranging from immediate to several hours in
   the absence of polymers. Polymers with intermediate
   hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity were found to substantially delay
   crystallization, whereas strongly hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers
   were largely ineffective. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
   experiments supported the supposition that polymers need to have
   affinity for both the drug-rich precipitate and the aqueous phase in
   order to be effective crystallization inhibitors. This study highlights
   the variability in the crystallization tendency of different compounds
   and provides insight into the mechanism of inhibition by polymeric
   additives. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists

   1995-2001. A groundwater data set of 983 samples with good geographical
   coverage and a long-term groundwater data set from 19 study sites were
   included. The isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in
   groundwaters shows a systematic shift from higher delta(18)O and deltaD
   values in the south to lower values in the north, the difference being
   approximately 4\% for oxygen and 34\% for hydrogen. The delta(18)O
   values are correlated with the mean annual surface temperature and the
   slope is close to that reported for the precipitation in European
   stations. In order to evaluate the relationship between the delta(18)O
   and deltaD values in precipitation and those in local groundwater,
   precipitation was collected at one site in southern Finland. No
   precipitation isotope records have been published in northern Finland,
   and those from groundwaters were therefore compared to published
   precipitation data from northern Sweden. No significant differences were
   observed between the mean annual delta(18)O and deltaD values in
   precipitation and those in local groundwaters. These groundwater data
   provide the first approximation of regional trends in the isotopic
   composition of precipitation in Finland. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Using the ERA-20C reanalysis and CRU TS4.03 observation based data, the
   study indicates a role of the rise in October-March mean seasonal
   surface pressure over the Near East (NE) in an intensification of moist
   air mass transport from Africa into the Eastern Mediterranean (EM)
   region during the last several decades. This yet non-addressed relevant
   mechanism allows an explanation for the actual less intense than over
   the rest of the Mediterranean Region (MR) precipitation decline as well
   as the rise in frequency of extreme precipitation events in the southern
   part of the EM under the global warming conditions in recent decades.
   This factor appears to be contributing in slowing the global warming
   associated precipitation decline in the southeastern EM and significant
   changes in the structure of the regional precipitation leading to an
   increase in the contribution of extreme precipitation associated with an
   intensification of the moist air mass transport over northeastern
   Africa-Arabian Peninsula area.},

Abstract = {The approximately century-long instrumental record of precipitation over
   land reflects a single sampling of internal variability. Thus, the
   spatiotemporal evolution of the observations is only one realization of
   ``what could have occurred{''} given the same climate system and
   boundary conditions but different initial conditions. While climate
   models can be used to produce initial-condition large ensembles that
   explicitly sample different sequences of internal variability, an
   analogous approach is not possible for the real world. Here, we explore
   the use of a statistical model for monthly precipitation to generate
   synthetic ensembles based on a single record. When tested within the
   context of the NCAR Community Earth System Model version 1 Large
   Ensemble (CESM1-LE), we find that the synthetic ensemble can closely
   reproduce the spatiotemporal statistics of variability and trends in
   winter precipitation over the extended contiguous United States and that
   it is difficult to infer the climate change signal in a single record
   given the magnitude of the variability. We additionally create a
   synthetic ensemble based on the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre
   (GPCC) dataset, termed the GPCC-synth-LE; comparison of the
   GPCC-synth-LE with the CESM1-based ensembles reveals differences in the
   spatial structures and magnitudes of variability, highlighting the
   advantages of an observationally based ensemble. We finally use the
   GPCC-synth-LE to analyze three water resource metrics in the upper
   Colorado River basin: frequency of dry, wet, and whiplash years.
   Thirty-one-year ``climatologies{''} in the GPCC-synth-LE can differ by
   over 20\% in these key water resource metrics due to sampling of
   internal variability, and individual ensemble members in the
   GPCC-synth-LE can exhibit large near-monotonic trends over the course of
   the last century due to sampling of internal variability alone.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated variabilities and trends in annual snowfall to
   total precipitation (S/P) ratio at Sodankyla, Kajaani and Kaisaniemi
   weather stations in northern, central and southern Finland during
   1909-2008. Annual S/ P ratio was estimated using daily precipitation and
   temperature records as input to a calibrated and validated
   temperature-index snowmelt model developed to simulate snowpack
   accumulation and melt processes in Finland. Factors controlling
   variations in annual S/P ratio and their relationships with large-scale
   atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs) were also studied. The results
   show that there were significant declines in annual S/P ratio during
   1909-2008, which were principally attributable to century-long
   decreasing trends in annual snowfall (S) in Finland. These reductions in
   annual S were predominantly controlled by both annual rainfall (R) and
   snowfall-day temperature (ST) in the south, annual ST in the centre, and
   annual R in the north. However, dividing the 100-year study period into
   an early (1909-1958) and late (1959-2008) periods revealed non-linear
   trend behaviours in annual S and consequently annual S/P ratio during
   1909-2008. The Arctic Oscillation, East Atlantic, East Atlantic/West
   Russia and Scandinavia patterns were the most influential ACPs for
   annual S variability.},

Title = {A unified statistical framework for detecting trends in multi-timescale
   precipitation extremes: application to non-stationary
   intensity-duration-frequency curves},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {145},

Abstract = {There is a large agreement that global warming induces changes of
   precipitation regimes of different nature and amplitude depending on the
   timescale considered. This question is of special concern regarding
   extreme rainfall that might have critical socio-environmental
   consequences. A unified framework is proposed here for detecting trends
   in extreme rainfall. It is based on the GEV distribution, whose
   parameters depend both on a simple scaling formulation to account for
   multiple time durations of rainfall and on time to account for the
   non-stationarity deriving from climatic trends. The implementation of
   the model is illustrated in the Sahel region by analyzing 30 in situ
   rainfall series of 28 years measured at time-steps from 2 to 24 h. While
   the separate analysis of the point series proves inconclusive for
   detecting trends at any of the time-steps considered, the inclusion of
   all the series and time-steps into the proposed unified model allows
   trends to be detected at a high level of confidence (p-value < 1\%).
   This trend essentially appears in the scale parameter of the regional
   GEV distribution, involving a 15 to 20\% increase of the 10-year
   rainfall in 28 years, and a 23 to 30\% increase of the 100-year
   rainfall. The main advantages of the proposed framework are (i) its
   parsimony, allowing for reducing the uncertainty associated with the
   model inference; (ii) its capacity for detecting trends either in the
   mean and/or in the variability of the extreme events; and (iii) its
   ability for producing non-stationary Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves
   that are coherent over a range of durations of accumulation.},

Abstract = {Changes in extreme precipitation are associated with changes in their
   probability distributions and the characteristics of quantiles derived
   from fitted distributions. In this study, the linear quantile regression
   method is employed to analyse spatio-temporal trends of extreme
   precipitation and to study the impact of North Atlantic tropical
   cyclones in the distribution of extreme precipitation for the
   southeastern United States. Daily annual maximum precipitation over the
   period of 64years (1950-2013) for 107 sites was used for the analysis.
   Our results show that changes in upper quantiles of the distributions of
   the extreme precipitation have occurred in the southeastern United
   States. Analysis of the potential changes in the distribution of the
   extreme precipitation by separating the historical record into two
   periods, that is, before and after 1981, reveals that upper-quantile
   trends have increasing magnitude in most of the sites for the latest
   time period. Analysis of the impact of tropical cyclones in the extreme
   precipitation distribution shows that overall the heavy rainfall events
   in the recent decades may have been caused by tropical cyclones. Such
   results are particularly useful for water managers who are more
   concerned with extreme values rather than the averaged one. Hence, our
   study has significant implication in environmental and infrastructural
   assessment as well as disaster risk management.},

Abstract = {California's interconnected water system is one of the most advanced
   water management systems in the world, and understanding of long-term
   trends in atmospheric and hydrologic behavior has increasingly being
   seen as vital to its future well-being. Knowledge of such trends is
   hampered by the lack of long-period observation data and the uncertainty
   surrounding future projections of atmospheric models. This study
   examines historical precipitation trends over the Shasta Dam Watershed
   (SDW), which lies downstream of one of the most important aspects of
   California's water system, Shasta Dam, using a dynamic downscaling
   methodology that can obtain reconstructed climate data at fine
   time-space scales. The methodology for reconstructing historical
   precipitation data over SDW started with the coarse-resolution
   historical 2.5 degrees Twentieth Century Reanalysis Version 2c (20CRv2c)
   dataset. The weather research and forecasting (WRF) model was then used
   to produce 159 years of long-term reconstructed hourly precipitation
   data at a 3 km spatial resolution over SDW. Trend analysis on this data
   indicated an increase in total precipitation over the study period as
   well as a growing intensity of extreme events such as 6, 12, 24, 48, and
   72-hour storms. These results both inform long-term planning decisions
   regarding the future of Shasta Dam and California's water system and
   validate a methodology that can be used in data-sparse basins around the
   world.},

Title = {Recent trends of the tropical hydrological cycle inferred from Global
   Precipitation Climatology Project and International Satellite Cloud
   Climatology Project data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Scores of modeling studies have shown that increasing greenhouse gases
   in the atmosphere impact the global hydrologic cycle; however,
   disagreements on regional scales are large, and thus the simulated
   trends of such impacts, even for regions as large as the tropics, remain
   uncertain. The present investigation attempts to examine such trends in
   the observations using satellite data products comprising Global
   Precipitation Climatology Project precipitation and International
   Satellite Cloud Climatology Project cloud and radiation. Specifically,
   evolving trends of the tropical hydrological cycle over the last 20-30
   years were identified and analyzed. The results show (1) intensification
   of tropical precipitation in the rising regions of the Walker and Hadley
   circulations and weakening over the sinking regions of the associated
   overturning circulation; (2) poleward shift of the subtropical dry zones
   (up to 2 degrees decade(-1) in June-July-August (JJA) in the Northern
   Hemisphere and 0.3-0.7 degrees decade(-1) in June-July-August and
   September-October-November in the Southern Hemisphere) consistent with
   an overall broadening of the Hadley circulation; and (3) significant
   poleward migration (0.9-1.7 degrees decade(-1)) of cloud boundaries of
   Hadley cell and plausible narrowing of the high cloudiness in the
   Intertropical Convergence Zone region in some seasons. These results
   support findings of some of the previous studies that showed
   strengthening of the tropical hydrological cycle and expansion of the
   Hadley cell that are potentially related to the recent global warming
   trends.},

Title = {Analysis and trends of precipitation lapse rate and extreme indices over
   north Sikkim eastern Himalayas under CMIP5ESM-2M RCPs experiments},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},

Volume = {167},

Abstract = {This paper draws attention to highlight the spatial and temporal
   variability in precipitation lapse rate (PLR) and precipitation extreme
   indices (PEIs) through the mesoscale characterization of Teesta river
   catchment, which corresponds to north Sikkim eastern Himalayas. A PLR
   rate is an important variable for the snowmelt runoff models. In a
   mountainous region, the PLR could be varied from lower elevation parts
   to high elevation parts. In this study, a PLR was computed by accounting
   elevation differences, which varies from around 1500 m to 7000 m. A
   precipitation variability and extremity were analysed using multiple
   mathematical functions viz. quantile regression, spatial mean, spatial
   standard deviation, Mann-Kendall test and Sen's estimation. For this
   reason, a daily precipitation, in the historical (years 1980-2005) as
   measured/observed gridded points and projected experiments for the 21st
   century (years 2006-2100) simulated by CMIP5 ESM-2 M model (Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Earth System Model 2) employing
   three different radiative forcing scenarios (Representative
   Concentration Pathways), utilized for the research work. The outcomes of
   this study suggest that a PLR is significantly varied from lower
   elevation to high elevation parts. The PEI based analysis showed that
   the extreme high intensity events have been increased significantly,
   especially after 2040s. The PEI based observations also showed that the
   numbers of wet days are increased for all the RCPs. The quantile
   regression plots showed significant increments in the upper and lower
   quantiles of the various extreme indices. The Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's estimation tests clearly indicated significant changing patterns
   in the frequency and intensity of the precipitation indices across all
   the sub-basins and RCP scenario in an intra-decadal time series domain.
   The RCP8.5 showed extremity of the projected outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {On the identification of seasonal trends, dependency and driving forces
   of precipitation and vertically integrated vapour transport over
   Northeast India},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {16},
Pages = {8019-8035},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {The vertically integrated horizontal vapour transport (IVT) accompanied
   by westerlies and southwesterlies mainly contributes as a distant source
   of moisture to the seasonal precipitation (PR). The moisture transport
   and PR patterns across the eastern Himalayas (Sikkim, northern
   Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh) are strongly modulated
   by the orographic setup, local land-atmospheric factors and
   teleconnection with climate indices of the Indian and Pacific oceans.
   This study elaborates on the changing patterns of PR and IVT, changes in
   IVT contribution to the seasonal PR under the nonstationary framework
   and evaluates the nonlinear dependency on local and distant drivers with
   piecewise regression model. Asymmetries in significant seasonal trends
   are conspicuous due to multi-altitude interactions. Strong declining
   trend over Assam and Arunachal Pradesh is evident for PR with concurrent
   rising trend over the Meghalaya plateau. The IVT signals show a
   significant decline in post-monsoon (October and November) and winter
   (December to February) across Assam Plain. The increase in mean IVT
   contributes significantly to seasonal PR. Significant decline in the
   contribution of heavy IVT to winter PR is observed over Manipur,
   Mizoram, Tripura and part of Assam. Surface 2 m temperature and net
   thermal radiation exhibit contrasting influence on seasonal PR. IVT
   shows mainly positive association with surface 2 m dew point temperature
   and latent heat flux across the eastern Himalayas. NINO3.4 index
   exhibits strong negative influence on post-monsoon PR. The Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation is strongly associated with summer (March to May)
   PR. Monsoon (June to September) IVT is negatively influenced by the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation over the Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Gangetic
   West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The Southern Oscillation Index is
   negatively linked with summer IVT. The combination of local driving
   forces mainly controls the seasonal PR and IVT across all seasons.
   Besides, distant drivers are prominent in monsoon and post-monsoon. This
   study reveals insights into recent changes of PR and IVT, their
   contribution to seasonal water resources in the eastern Himalayas and
   the controlling strength of local land-atmosphere feedback mechanism and
   distant land-ocean coupling drivers under nonstationary climate.},

Abstract = {Bayesian regularized back-propagation neural network (BRBPNN) was
   developed for trend analysis, acidity and chemical composition of
   precipitation in North Carolina using precipitation chemistry data in
   NADP. This study included two BRBPNN application problems: (i) the
   relationship between precipitation acidity (pH) and other ions (NH4+,
   NO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl- and Na+) was performed by BRBPNN and
   the achieved optimal network structure was 8-15-1. Then the relative
   importance index, obtained through the sum of square weights between
   each input neuron and the hidden layer of BRBPNN(8-15-1), indicated that
   the ions' contribution to the acidity declined in the order of NH4+ >
   SO42- > NO3-; and (ii) investigations were also carried out using BRBPNN
   with respect to temporal variation of monthly mean NH4+, SO42- and NO3-
   concentrations and their optimal architectures for the 1990-2003 data
   were 4-6-1, 4-6-1 and 4-4-1, respectively. All the estimated results of
   the optimal BRBPNNs showed that the relationship between the acidity and
   other ions or that between NH4+, SO42-, NO3- concentrations with regard
   to precipitation amount and time variable was obviously nonlinear, since
   in contrast to multiple linear regression (MLR), BRBPNN was clearly
   better with less error in prediction and of higher correlation
   coefficients. Meanwhile, results also exhibited that BRBPNN was of
   automated regularization parameter selection capability and may ensure
   the excellent fitting and robustness. Thus, this study laid the
   foundation for the application of BRBPNN in the analysis of acid
   precipitation.},

Title = {Long-term trend of wintertime precipitation chemistry at a remote islet
   site influenced by anthropogenic emissions from continental East Asia},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {262},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {In this study, the trends and factors influencing wintertime
   precipitation chemistry at a remote site downwind of continental East
   Asia were investigated. A total of 336 precipitation samples were
   collected from 2005 to 2019 at Pengjia Islet, a site similar to 56 km
   north of the main island of Taiwan. Overall, the samples had a
   volume-weighted mean pH of 4.81 (ranging from 3.03 to 7.00), with 74\%
   of samples considered as acid rain (pH < 5). PMF analysis of the samples
   identified sea-salt, anthropogenic emissions, and dust as sources of
   major ions in precipitation. Anthropogenic emissions were mostly
   associated with polluted air from East Asia. Four major air mass
   transport pathways to Pengjia Islet were identified, in which 87\%
   originated from northern China (i.e. polluted air masses) with a
   relatively low pH and high ionic concentrations compared to the
   remaining samples. Wintertime pH values associated with the most common
   trajectory from China significantly increased at a rate of +1.7\% yr(-1)
   (p < 0.01) from 2005 to 2019, similar to those observed at other sites
   in East Asia in the previous two decades. The increasing pH trend in
   this study was attributed to the decrease in nss-SO42- concentrations
   and an increase in Ca2+ concentrations, of which the former aligns with
   the decrease in nss-SO42- at sites in China caused by the decline of SO2
   emissions. The increase of Ca2+ concentrations is supported by the
   increase of coarse mode aerosol mass concentrations transported to
   northern Taiwan in winter. By splitting the dataset into two periods
   (i.e. 2005-2011 and 2012-2019), we found a close relationship between
   the changes in air-quality control in China and trends in precipitation
   chemistry at Pengjia Islet, including a consistently decreasing
   nssSO(4)(2-)/NO3 ratio in rainwater. Such a finding has important
   implications for the effectiveness of air pollution control policies on
   the regional scale. Additionally, changes in regional transport patterns
   of air masses might also contribute to the changes in precipitation
   chemistry at Pengjia Islet.},

Title = {Detection and attribution of precipitation trends associated with the

Abstract = {Observational studies demonstrate a poleward shift in the South Atlantic
   Convergence Zone (SACZ) in recent decades with regional impacts on
   extreme precipitation. However, the relative contribution of
   anthropogenic forcing and natural variability to the observed trends is
   presently unknown. To evaluate the main forcings associated with the
   recent trends in precipitation rate consistent with the poleward shift
   of the SACZ, this study examines the last 40 years of the historical
   scenario of 20 global climate models participating in the fifth phase of
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The relative
   contribution of natural variability and anthropogenic-related forcings
   to precipitation in the 20(th) century is assessed based on historical,
   natural, anthropogenic, and pre-industrial simulations from CMIP5
   models. Over the study area, precipitation trends simulated by the CMIP5
   historical scenario are small, with large disagreement among models and
   members. Despite the small magnitude of the trends, the spatial pattern
   emerging is coherent with a poleward displacement of the SACZ, as
   indicated by a reduction (increase) in the precipitation rate over
   Southeastern Brazil (Southeastern South America). Even with large
   discrepancies among models, the attribution analysis suggests that
   precipitation trends could partially result from land-use change,
   followed by changes in ozone concentrations, with more significant
   influence over Southeastern Brazil. The large uncertainty in the
   simulated precipitation suggests that not all mechanisms related to the
   position and intensity of the SACZ events are well captured by the CMIP5
   models considered here.},

Abstract = {The meteorological drought is a devastating phenomenon with far reaching
   social and economic effects. The study of drought is important for the
   sustainable management of water resources which are becoming depleted.
   This study looks at drought in Al Hoceima province of northern Morocco,
   using analysis of precipitation trends and the Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) with a simple linear regression followed by an
   assessment of severity. Meteorological information from five stations in
   the Al Hoceima region from 1975-2016 were used. According to the
   results, the 80s are the most affected by the drought. The occasional
   examination of precipitation has shown that trends in all seasons,
   precipitation series are expanding. More than 74\% of the observation
   years considered experienced a severe meteorological drought. The
   southern part of the province has been relatively less dry compared to
   the central and northern. The maximum severity of the drought was seven
   consecutive years recorded at the Al Hoceima station, at 74\% from
   October 1978 to November 1985. This drought trend requires intervention
   to minimize the impact as the earth continues to experience climate
   change.},

Abstract = {A novel quantitative assessment of late Holocene precipitation in the
   Levant is presented, including mean and variance of annual precipitation
   and their trends. A stochastic framework was utilized and allowed,
   possibly for the first time, linking high-quality, reconstructed
   rises/declines in Dead Sea levels with precipitation trends in its
   watershed. We determined the change in mean annual precipitation for 12
   specific intervals over the past 4500 yr, concluding that: (1) the
   twentieth century was substantially wetter than most of the late
   Holocene; (2) a representative reference value of mean annual
   precipitation is 75\% of the present-day parameter; (3) during the late
   Holocene, mean annual precipitation ranged between -17 and +66\% of the
   reference value (-37 to +25\% of present-day conditions); (4) the driest
   intervals were 1500-1200 BC and AD 755-890, and the wettest intervals
   were 2500-2460 BC, 130-40 BC, AD 350-490, and AD 1770-1940; (5)
   lake-level rises and declines probably occurred in response to trends in
   precipitation means and are less likely to occur when precipitation mean
   is constant; (6) average trends in mean annual precipitation during
   intervals of 200 yr did not exceed 15 mm per decade. The precipitation
   trends probably reflect shifts in eastern Mediterranean cyclone tracks.},

Abstract = {Recently, Japan's Meteorological Research Institute presented the d4PDF
   database (Database for Policy Decision-Making for Future Climate Change,
   d4PDF) through large-scale climate ensemble simulations to overcome
   uncertainty arising from variability when the general circulation model
   represents extreme-scale precipitation. In this study, the change of
   precipitation characteristics between the historical and future climate
   conditions in the Yongdam-dam basin was analyzed using the d4PDF data.
   The result shows that annual mean precipitation and seasonal mean
   precipitation increased by more than 10\% in future climate conditions.
   This study also performed an analysis on the change of the return period
   rainfall. The annual maximum daily rainfall was extracted for each
   climatic condition, and the rainfall with each return period was
   estimated. In this process, we represent the extreme-scale rainfall
   corresponding to a very long return period without any statistical model
   and method as the d4PDF provides rainfall data during 3,000 years for
   historical climate conditions and during 5,400 years for future climate
   conditions. The rainfall with a 50-year return period under future
   climate conditions exceeded the rainfall with a 100-year return period
   under historical climate conditions. Consequently, in future climate
   conditions, the magnitude of rainfall increased at the same return
   period and, the return period decreased at the same magnitude of
   rainfall. In this study, by using the d4PDF data, it was possible to
   analyze the change in extreme magnitude of rainfall.},

Title = {Long-Term Trends in Acid Precipitation and Watershed Elemental Export
   From an Alpine Catchment of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA},

Abstract = {Acid deposition associated with precipitation is an ecological problem
   that has affected watersheds in industrialized parts of North America
   and Europe, but remote landscapes, such as the Colorado Rocky Mountains,
   have also been impacted. The deposition of strong acids, including
   nitric and sulfuric acids, has decreased substantially over the past 30
   years at Niwot Ridge, a high-alpine watershed of Colorado. The pH of
   precipitation has followed these declines and has increased to similar
   to 5.5. Meanwhile, NH4+, another important constituent of acid/base
   balance, and a fertilizing nutrient, has more than doubled in
   precipitation between 1984 and 2017. A statistical model of long-term
   water chemistry concentrations and loads revealed a variety of trends in
   watershed export of acids and bases, some of which were unexpected, and
   remain unexplained. For example, despite declining sulfate deposition,
   sulfate export has increased. On the other hand, watershed nitrate
   export has remained constant despite decreases in atmospheric
   deposition, while watershed NH4+ export has increased, albeit minimally,
   relative to total nitrogen export. Watershed pH and alkalinity appear to
   have stabilized in response to decreased acid precipitation, which may
   be explained by geochemical processes, such as carbonate weathering.
   Overall, in this high-alpine watershed, atmospheric deposition is
   trending toward preindustrial conditions, and there is a need to conduct
   targeted, process-based studies to determine the mechanisms underlying
   these trends. The unexpected watershed responses that we identify here
   require a new framework for understanding acid precipitation recovery.},

Abstract = {The relationship between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and
   precipitation along the Peruvian Pacific coast is investigated over
   1964-2011 on the basis of a variety of indices accounting for the
   different types of El Nino events and atmospheric and oceanographic
   manifestations of the interannual variability in the tropical Pacific.
   We show the existence of fluctuations in the ENSO/precipitation
   relationship at decadal timescales that are associated with the ENSO
   property changes over the recent decades. Several indices are considered
   in order to discriminate the influence of the two types of El Nino,
   namely, the eastern Pacific El Nino and the central Pacific El Nino, as
   well as the influence of large-scale atmospheric variability associated
   to the Madden and Julian Oscillation, and of regional oceanic
   conditions. Three main periods are identified that correspond to the
   interleave periods between the main climatic transitions over 1964-2011,
   i.e. the shifts of the 1970s and the 2000s, over which ENSO experiences
   significant changes in its characteristics. We show that the
   relationship between ENSO and precipitation along the western coast of
   Peru has experienced significant decadal change. Whereas El Nino events
   before 2000 lead to increased precipitation, in the 2000s, ENSO is
   associated to drier conditions. This is due to the change in the main
   ENSO pattern after 2000 that is associated to cooler oceanic conditions
   off Peru during warm events (i.e. central Pacific El Nino). Our analysis
   also indicates that the two extreme El Nino events of 1982/1983 and
   1997/1998 have overshadowed actual trends in the relationship between
   interannual variability in the tropical Pacific and precipitation along
   the coast of Peru. Overall, our study stresses on the complexity of the
   hydrological cycle on the western side of the Andes with regard to its
   relationship with the interannual to decadal variability in the tropical
   Pacific. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Climate change has become an increasingly dominant environmental issue
   which has been attracting more and more attention in recent years. It is
   necessary to determine the cycle and trend of annual precipitation in
   the Haihe River Basin in the context of climate change because it is the
   largest river system in northern China. A combined method of rescaled
   range analysis and wavelet analysis is applied to identify the cycle and
   trend in annual precipitation based on data from 12 weather stations in
   the Haihe River Basin. The results of wavelet analysis show that the 12
   weather stations all have the long main cycles of 35-38 years and the
   medium length cycles of 22-25 years. Datong, Yuanping, Shijiazhuang,
   Taiyuan, Anyang, and Huimin stations have the short-length cycles of
   9-11 years. The results of re scaled range analysis show that all of the
   Hurst exponents are greater than 0.5, which indicates that the future
   trend of annual precipitation will very likely follow the historical
   trend. Therefore, nine stations will have the downward trends, and other
   stations will have the upward trends in the future, according to the
   analysis of the historical trends by the method of wavelet analysis.},

Abstract = {Evidence of biological responses to climate change continues to grow.
   Long-term monitoring programs are critical in documenting these changes
   as well as identifying the primary stressors that may influence a
   species' ability to adapt to changing climate. Eastern North American
   salt marshes support the greatest number of endemic salt marsh
   vertebrates globally, two of which are sympatric from southern Maine to
   northern Massachusetts, USA. Saltmarsh Sparrows (Ammodramus caudacutus),
   listed `vulnerable' by the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature (IUCN), have a restricted global breeding range that occurs in
   salt marshes from Maine to Virginia, USA. Nelson's Sparrows (Ammodramus
   nelsoni) breed in salt marshes from Massachusetts north to the Canadian
   Maritime Provinces and west to the prairie pothole regions of central
   Canada. These taxa hybridize in sympatry which may affect how these taxa
   respond to changing habitat quality and availability caused by climate
   change. We present the first estimates of the effects of sea level rise,
   breeding season precipitation, and salt marsh patch size on the
   abundance and population trends for three groups: (1) Saltmarsh
   Sparrows, (2) Nelson's Sparrows, and (3) all Sharp-tailed Sparrows
   {[}the combined population of both species including hybrids]. We used
   14 years of population monitoring data (2000-2013) from nine saltmarshes
   within the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, Maine, USA. We
   detected a declining trend for Saltmarsh Sparrow (i.e., significant
   decline, but not significantly more than 5 \% per year), stable trends
   for Nelson's Sparrows and for all Sharp-tailed Sparrows (i.e., no
   significant increase or decrease over the time period). Abundances for
   the three sparrow groups varied among years and marsh units. Drier years
   with relatively low mean sea levels had the greatest abundances.
   Breeding season precipitation negatively influenced population trends
   for Saltmarsh and Nelson's Sparrows and mean sea level had a negative
   effect on Saltmarsh Sparrow population trends. Our results indicate that
   Saltmarsh Sparrow, the species most specialized to salt marshes, has
   declined which may be indicative of broader, regional patterns. The
   negative relationships of mean sea level and precipitation with
   Saltmarsh Sparrow population trends suggest that the negative effects of
   increasing nest flooding may be having demographic-level effects on this
   local population. Analyses of other salt marsh bird long-term monitoring
   programs are warranted to determine if this pattern is consistent in
   other portions of the Saltmarsh Sparrow range.},

Title = {Contrasting long-term alpine and subalpine precipitation trends in a
   mid-latitude North American mountain system, Colorado Front Range, USA},
Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY},

Volume = {8},
Number = {5-6, SI},

Abstract = {Background: Long-term climate trends in mountain systems often vary
   strongly with elevation.
   Aims: To evaluate elevation dependence in long-term precipitation trends
   in subalpine forest and alpine tundra zones of a mid-continental,
   mid-latitude North American mountain system and to relate such
   dependence to atmospheric circulation patterns.
   Methods: We contrasted 59-year (1952-2010) precipitation records of two
   high-elevation climate stations on Niwot Ridge, Colorado Front Range,
   Rocky Mountains, USA. The sites, one in forest (3022m a.s.l.) and the
   other in alpine tundra (3739m), are closely located (within 7km
   horizontally, ca. 700m vertically), but differ with respect to proximity
   to the mountain-system crest (the Continental Divide).
   Results: The sites exhibited significant differences in annual and
   seasonal precipitation trends, which depended strongly on their
   elevation and distance from the Continental Divide. Annual precipitation
   increased by 60mm (+6\%) per decade at the alpine site, with no
   significant change at the subalpine site. Seasonally, trends at the
   alpine site were dominated by increases in winter, which we suggest
   resulted from an increase in orographically generated precipitation over
   the Divide, driven by upper-air (700 hPa) north-westerly flow. Such a
   change was not evident at the subalpine site, which is less affected by
   orographic precipitation on north-westerly flow.
   Conclusions: Elevation dependence in precipitation trends appears to
   have arisen from a change in upper-air flow from predominantly
   south-westerly to north-westerly. Dependence of precipitation trends on
   topographic position and season has complex implications for the ecology
   and hydrology of Niwot Ridge and adjacent watersheds, involving
   interactions among physical processes (e.g. snowpack dynamics) and
   biotic responses (e.g. in phenologies and ecosystem productivity).},

Title = {Composition of Ore Fluid Inclusions from the Viburnum Trend, Southeast
   Missouri District, United States: Implications for Transport and
   Precipitation Mechanisms},
Journal = {ECONOMIC GEOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {106},

Abstract = {Fluid inclusions hosted by sphalerite and dolomite cement from the
   Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposits of the Viburnum Trend of the
   Southeast Missouri district were analyzed by microthermometry and laser
   ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to
   determine the composition of mineralizing fluids and to seek insights
   into ore-forming processes. On the whole, fluid inclusions from
   throughout the paragenesis have compositions resembling deep sedimentary
   brines. A population of anomalously Pb-rich fluid inclusions with
   concentrations reaching 1,500 ppm was identified in some of the
   paragenetically early and main-stage sphalerite, which is interpreted to
   represent the influx of a Pb- and possibly overall metal-rich fluid into
   Southeast Missouri during the time of sulfide mineralization. This
   influx of Pb-rich fluid appears to have been intermittent, as at least
   one stage of dolomite cement that hosts Pb-poor fluid inclusions occurs
   between intervals of sphalerite that host Pb-rich fluid inclusions. If
   fluid flow into the district was principally from one direction, for
   example, from the Arkoma basin to the south, then the intermittency in
   high Pb concentrations could be explained by compositional changes in
   the source region or along the flow path. Alternatively, if fluid flow
   into the district was from two or more directions and fluid arriving
   from each direction had a different composition, then the intermittency
   in high Pb concentrations could be explained by transient variations in
   the relative flow rates from each direction.
   Lead concentrations on the order of thousands of parts per million make
   it unlikely that the Southeast Missouri ores were precipitated by any
   mechanism that involved simultaneous transport of metals and sulfide in
   the same fluid, as the concentrations of sulfide that could coexist with
   such high concentrations of Pb would be too low to allow the ores to be
   deposited within a geologically, reasonable period of time, unless the
   pH was very low or groundwater flow rates were very high. Thus, some
   type of mixing scenario seems more likely involving either mixing of a
   metal- with a sulfide-rich fluid or mixing of a metal- and sulfate-rich
   fluid with a reductant present either in the host rock or in another
   fluid.
   Fluid inclusions hosted by sphalerite have K/Na and Ca/Mg ratios that
   partly resemble the compositions of both main-stage cuboctahedral galena
   and less abundant late-stage cubic galena, suggesting that sphalerite
   was precipitated from a mixture of the fluids that precipitated these
   two types of galena. However, the fact that aqueous Pb concentration
   does not correlate with these ratios or other indicators of main-stage
   mineralization, such as matrix Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Ag, and Cd content in
   sphalerite, suggests that more than two fluids were involved in mixing.},

Title = {Controls of lithology and climate over chemical weathering trends: new
   insights from the precipitation-dominated Dokriani glacier, central
   Himalaya, India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 5},
Abstract = {The chemical composition of meltwater-draining Himalayan glacierized
   basins reflects the dominance of carbonic acid in weathering of silicate
   and carbonate minerals, yet the role of sulfuric acid-mediated reactions
   in the mineral weathering and ionic release is still unclear. Here, we
   present a long-term study (1992-2018) of chemical weathering
   characteristics of a precipitation-dominated glacierized basin (Dokriani
   glacier) of central Himalaya. By using new and reprocessed datasets of
   major ions from the glacial/subglacial zones of the glacier, we suggest
   that two-thirds of the dissolved load of the meltwater derives from
   sulfuric acid-mediated weathering of minerals and rocks. We observed a
   clear control of carbonic acid-mediated reactions in the early ablation
   periods, while sulfuric acid-mediated reactions dominate in peak and
   late ablation periods. The slopes and intercepts in best-fit regressions
   of {[}{*}Ca2+ + {*}Mg2+ vs {*}SO42- and HCO3-] and {[}HCO3- vs {*}SO42-]
   in meltwater were following the stoichiometric parameters of sulfide
   oxidation coupled to carbonate dissolution reactions. The glaciers of
   the central and western Himalaya are in good agreement with the present
   estimates. We contend that the bedrock lithology has limited or
   second-order effects over the ionic release from Himalayan glaciers and
   surmise that these patterns are broadly applicable to the other orogenic
   systems of the world.},

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {87},

Abstract = {In this study, the trends of annual and seasonal precipitation time
   series were examined on the basis of measurements of 22 surface stations
   in Greece for the period 1955-2001, and satellite data during the period
   1980-2001. For this purpose, two statistical tests based on the least
   square method and one based on the Mann-Kendall test, which is also
   capable of detecting the starting year of possible climatic
   discontinuities or changes, are applied. Greece, in general, presents a
   clear significant downward trend in annual precipitation for the period
   1955-2001, which is determined by the respective decreasing trend in
   winter precipitation. Both winter and annual series exhibit a downward
   trend with a starting year being 1984. Satellite-derived precipitation
   time series could be an alternative means for diagnosing the variability
   of precipitation in Greece and detecting trends provided that they have
   been adjusted by surface measurements in the wider area of interest. The
   relationship between precipitation variability in Greece and atmospheric
   circulation was also examined using correlation analysis with three
   circulation indices: the well-known North Atlantic Oscillation Index
   (NAOI), a Mediterranean Oscillation Index (MOI) and a new Mediterranean
   Circulation Index (MCI). NAOI is the index that presented the most
   interesting correlation with winter, summer and annual precipitation in
   Greece, whereas the MOI and MCI were found to explain a significant
   proportion of annual and summer precipitation variability, respectively.
   The observed downward trend in winter and annual precipitation in Greece
   is linked mainly to a rising trend in the hemispheric circulation modes
   of the NAO, which are connected with the Mediterranean Oscillation
   Index.},

Title = {Spatial trend and source apportionment of metals in wet atmospheric
   precipitation: a study on drying Urmia Lake implications, NW Iran},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 12},
Abstract = {During this decade, the drying of Urmia Lake resulted in devastating
   tragedies in the region, resulting in the emission of toxic metals into
   the atmosphere. Urmia city's wet atmospheric depositions were analysed
   to assess the quantity and spatial trends of numerous heavy metals and
   sodium (Na), as well as their sources. Wet precipitation was collected
   as rainwater, and the concentration of metals was determined using an
   Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). The
   mean concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper
   (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), and sodium (Na) were 0.14,
   0.18, 1, 3.7, 2.9, 5.6, 6.3 \& mu;g/L, and 2.6 mg/L, respectively,
   following the sequence Na > Zn > Ni > Cu > Pb > Cr > Cd > As. To
   identify the sources of these metals, enrichment factor analysis and
   principal component analysis (PCA) were employed. The enrichment factor
   analysis revealed that Na and As exhibited relatively low enrichment
   factors suggesting natural sources, whereas Zn, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb
   were highly enriched, indicating significant contributions from
   anthropogenic sources. The distribution map of Urmia City demonstrated
   that the northern and western parts of the city were highly polluted
   with As, Ni, Cr, and Zn. PCA analysis revealed that the emissions from
   vehicles and fuel combustion were the primary sources of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni,
   and Pb, whereas the drying of the Urmia lake is the primary source of
   Na, As, and Zn. The process of the lake bottom drying likely releases
   these metals into the atmosphere, leading to their deposition in the
   surrounding areas.},

Abstract = {The recent heavy downpours in specific regions have initiated several
   studies on the relationship between aerosol and precipitation. The
   increase in pollution/population and the recent outbreak of diseases and
   environmental deterioration have been preceded by an increase in aerosol
   concentration, which would be directly related to precipitation.
   Considering this background, several studies are being conducted to
   define a clear relationship between aerosol concentration and
   precipitation. With the current need to understand aerosol and its
   characteristics to reduce pollution, research in this domain has
   significantly increased followed by the demand for control measures and
   impacts on human health and the environment. A systematic literature
   review is followed to aid future researchers in mapping the studies and
   themes related to aerosol and precipitation. Some studies have shown the
   direct effect of aerosols on the reduction in land surface temperature,
   by reflection and indirectly enhancing the cloud reflectivity. Even
   though the research studies conducted in the past have not achieved the
   perfect correlation of airborne particles and their influence on
   precipitation around the globe. Our study attempts to show the
   bibliometric literature review of aerosol and precipitation studies. The
   mapping stated four conceptual structures of different theme domains:
   Sampling and retrieval methods, Characterization and effects, Assessment
   studies, Health and environmental impacts, and Modeling and measures.
   Lastly, the mapping identified the limitations of the research review,
   and the scope of future studies to be carried out.},

Title = {Using the snow-day fraction to measure climatic change in southern

Volume = {151},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Global temperatures are increasing, and regional precipitation patterns
   are changing. Snow is an excellent indicator of regional climate change;
   50 years of temperature and precipitation data were analysed from
   weather stations located within the five most populated cities of
   Ontario (Canada). Recorded measurements for temperature and
   precipitation were converted into binary values to indicate the
   frequency of rain days, snow days, wet days (when total precipitation is
   greater than 0.2 mm) and freezing days (when the average temperature is
   less than 0 degrees C); then, these values were summed over each winter
   season from 1970/71 to 2019/20. The snow-day fraction was calculated
   from the seasonal totals by dividing the total number of snow days by
   the total number of wet days. Historical trends were detected using
   Pearson's R, Kendall's Tau and Spearman's Rho. Differences in mean
   values between the first decade (1971-1980) and the last decade
   (2011-2020) within the time series for the snow-day fraction and total
   freezing days were determined using Student's t-tests. During the winter
   season in southern Ontario (December 1 to March 31), total snow days,
   total wet days, the snow-day fraction and freezing days were all
   decreasing at statistically significant rates (90 to 99\% confidence
   levels) across four of the five cities studied (Toronto, Ottawa,
   Hamilton and London). Mississauga was the exception, being the only city
   where rain days were increasing, but no trends were detected for snow
   days or wet days. The snow-day fraction was decreasing in Mississauga
   but not at a statistically significant rate, despite freezing days
   decreasing at the greatest rate compared to the other four cities. Total
   freezing days were highly correlated with the snow-day fraction during
   the winter season, being able to explain 61 to 76 percent of the
   observed variability, where Mississauga recorded the weakest correlation
   and London recorded the strongest correlation.},

Abstract = {In this study, the impacts of climate change on the extreme
   precipitation indices in the Western Black Sea Basin, Turkey, were
   investigated in terms of trend analyses based on the historical and
   projected daily precipitation data. Eight extreme precipitation indices
   were computed using the reference period data obtained from nine
   meteorological stations and dynamically downscaled outputs of
   GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-MR global circulation models (GCMs)
   under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The biases in the outputs of
   GCMs were corrected by using the linear scaling method. The Mann-Kendall
   and Spearman's rho tests were utilized to detection of the trend in the
   precipitation indices during the reference (1971-2000) and future
   periods (2020-2099). The results of the analyses for the reference
   period showed a strong increasing trend in indices in the eastern part
   of the basin and nonsignificant trends (both increasing and decreasing)
   in the western part. On the other hand, for the future period, the
   results demonstrated that the amount of total precipitation will
   increase (a positive trend in PRCPTOT). However, the number of dry days
   will increase. This situation indicates that there will be no
   significant change in the total amount of precipitation, but there will
   be an increase in the intensity of precipitation and the number of dry
   days during the coming years that can cause flooding and drought,
   respectively. Therefore, suitable adaptive and mitigative actions have
   to be taken, especially in terms of urban planning and agriculture.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of trends and variability in precipitation
   across Morocco: Comparative analysis of recent and old non-parametric
   methods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {196},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the essence of climate change, a better understanding of the
   variation in precipitation patterns provides in-depth knowledge of water
   resource management and mitigation of floods and droughts, particularly
   in Morocco where rainfed agriculture is predominant. This paper
   investigates the precipitation variability over the whole country of
   Morocco. To that end, a monthly precipitation dataset of 78 rain gauges
   with more than 40 years of observation was used to investigate the
   spatial-temporal variability of precipitation. Moreover, the
   spatio-temporal trends variation was also assessed through a comparative
   analysis of the various trend detection methods (both old and new
   tests). The new methods were used also to identify non-monotonic
   sub-trends. The results highlighted that (1) Morocco has experienced
   considerably larger variations regarding the temporal variability of
   precipitations and their spatial distribution during the last few
   decades; (2) the greatest variability of precipitation was observed
   moving latitudinally from humid to arid regions; (3) the annual
   precipitation exhibited positive and negative trends where there was no
   clear evidence of upward or downward trends. The significant trends are
   identified for 5(6,41\%), 6 (7,69\%), 3 (3,84\%), and 65 (83\%) stations
   from the results of the MK test, SR test, Onyutha???s method, and ITA
   method, respectively. (4) the MK, SR, and Onyutha methods exhibited
   similar trends which indicate that are in perfect concordance. The ITA
   method showed also some resemblance with the results of other methods
   even though it proved to be over-sensitive in determining trend
   significance; and (5) the highlands with a Mediterranean climate are
   prone to flooding whereas the regions with desertic and semi-arid
   climates are prone to drought. Overall, our findings allow policy-makers
   to properly design adaptation strategies for changing precipitation
   patterns as well as increasing extreme events (floods and droughts).

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAR 2},
Abstract = {Observations indicate that late-summer precipitation over the East Asian
   transitional climate zone (TCZ) showed a pronounced decreasing trend
   during 1951-2005. This study examines the relative contributions of
   anthropogenic {[}including anthropogenic aerosol (AA) and greenhouse gas
   (GHG)] and natural forcings to the drying trend of the East Asian TCZ
   based on simulations from CMIP5. The results indicate that AA forcing
   plays a dominant role in contributing to the drying trend of the TCZ. AA
   forcing weakens the East Asian summer monsoon via reducing the land-sea
   thermal contrast, which induces strong low-level northerly anomalies
   over eastern China, suppresses water vapor transport from southern
   oceans and results in drier conditions over the TCZ. In contrast, GHG
   forcing leads to a wetting trend in the TCZ by inducing southerly wind
   anomalies, thereby offsetting the effect of the AA forcing. Natural
   forcing has a weak impact on the drying trend of the TCZ due to the weak
   response of atmospheric anomalies.},

Abstract = {Spatial-temporal trends of extreme precipitation have great impacts on
   disaster risks, and relevant studies usually receive much attention. In
   China, spatial-temporal trends have been analysed in numerous studies
   based on daily rainfall data; however, the densities of rain gauges in
   many studies were relatively low, and the effects of complex topography
   on extreme precipitation were usually not considered, which have lowered
   the reliability and accuracy of the reported results. In this study,
   several widely used extreme precipitation indices were chosen, and the
   spatial-temporal trends of a typical watershed in the Hengduan Mountain
   Region in Southwest China, the Longchuanjiang watershed, were analysed
   using the Mann-Kendall trend analysis based on daily rainfall data. The
   effect of elevation on the extreme precipitation indices based on the
   high-intensity rain gauges and the effect of elevation on the temporal
   trends of extreme precipitation indices were analysed, which have rarely
   been reported. The results indicated that: (a) significant positive
   correlations with elevation were reported for annual precipitation and
   most of the extreme precipitation indices, including PRCPTOT, Rx5day,
   R95P, R99P, RD, SDII, and CWD, while significant negative correlations
   were reported for CDD; the relationships between SDII and Rx1day were
   not significant with elevation; (b) the density of rain gauges in the
   regions with complex topography can have great impacts on the results;
   and (c) no significant correlation between the elevation and the
   temporal trends of extreme precipitation indices were reported. This
   study highlights the effects of the density of rain gauges and
   elevation, or topographical factors on the spatial distribution and
   temporal trends of extreme precipitation indices, which has rarely been
   reported in previous studies, implying that such effects should be fully
   taken into consideration in the relevant studies in the future.},

Abstract = {Water scarcity is becoming a serious threat, which may have negative
   environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Increases in the projected
   global temperature and changes in regional distribution and intensity of

   identify drought events in the present and future climate. The index is
   initially calculated using data from meteorological stations of the

   regional climate models. The period of 1971-2000 is chosen as present
   climate and the future climate conditions are studied using the model
   timeseries up to 2100. The present-period was divided into two
   sub-periods and significant drought events were identified over the
   recent period of 1989-2000. Overall, we found that intense droughts
   occurred in continental Greece, whereas the islands, including Crete,
   experienced milder drought episodes. The years 1989 and 2000 were the
   driest on record for Greece, resulting in serious consequences for both
   urban and rural areas. The 21st Century projections did not suggest
   radical changes in the region's rainfall patterns, although potentially
   intense drought events are expected to increase in the western parts of
   the country.},

Abstract = {Based on the relevant modules of ArcGIS 10.5 platform, the singly
   independent precipitation datum of 25 hydrological and meteorological
   observation stations from 1960 to 2016 was converted into areal datum of
   different statistical units through multiscale transformation to study
   change rules and trends of precipitation in the upper Lijiang River. The
   variation coefficient and Mann-Kendall test methods were applied to
   analyzing the difference and significance of precipitation. According to
   the study, precipitation distribution within a year was highly uneven
   with an obvious difference between the rainy and dry seasons; the
   interannual changes of precipitation showed a slightly increasing trend
   in the high and low interlaced. The increasing trends of precipitation
   during the rainy season and decreasing during the dry season will
   further aggravate the contradiction between water resource shortages
   during the dry season and increasing flooding disasters during the rainy
   season in the Lijiang River basin.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric fronts are fundamental features of the weather variability
   in the mid-latitudes and are frequently associated with high-impact
   weather events such as hail, wind gusts or precipitation. A method to
   link precipitation with synoptic-scale fronts on sub-daily timescales is
   developed based on ERA-Interim data (1979-2016). A case study, a
   climatology and a trend analysis are presented and discussed. Spatially,
   an optimal attribution radius is identified based on a random sampling
   technique. The method is demonstrated using a past weather event that
   occurred over western Europe. Annual and seasonal cycles are presented
   and confirm, in agreement with previous studies, that frontal
   precipitation accounts for a large fraction of all precipitation (up to
   80\%) in the mid-latitudes, especially during autumn and winter.
   Finally, a negative trend in frontal precipitation is identified, mostly
   affecting the Gulf Stream region. Cold fronts drive most of the observed
   trends in this region and the trend pattern suggests a polewards
   displacement of the zone of enhanced precipitation.},

Abstract = {Drought is among the most complex climatic phenomena affecting the
   environment and society. Drought impacts are commonly quantified using
   drought indices (DIs), which are a function of several
   hydro-meteorological variables and are assumed to adequately quantify
   the degree of drought hazard for sensitive systems. The Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) has significant advantages such as simplicity,
   suitability on variable time scale and robustness, based on solid
   theoretical development. Consequently, SPI has been selected by the
   World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as a key indicator for
   monitoring drought and used increasingly during the last two decades.
   This study uses the 161-year-long global gridded dataset of the SPI,
   computed from v2c version of the NOAA-CIRES 20CR precipitation database
   for 4 most frequently used time windows of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months denoted
   here as SPI-1, SPI-3, SPI-6 and SPI-12, respectively. The time series of
   these SPIs are analyzed for three gridcells, located over the Balkan
   Peninsula, showing the onset, ending, duration and the severity of the
   longest drought events. This study describes one primary event, which is
   common for all gridcells and other 4 secondary ones. The trend analyses
   performed additionally using standard methods (linear regression,
   Mann-Kendall test) do not detect any general pattern (i.e. for all SPIs
   and gridcells).},

Abstract = {An analysis of high resolution network data of daily precipitation in
   Sardinia from 1951 to 2000 is presented. The mean distance between the
   stations is about 10 km. Comparison between monthly series shows
   significantly higher extreme values in October and November. Decadal
   mobile window Wilkoxon-Mann-Whitney test indicates that the decade
   1965-1975 has significantly higher values than the rest of the yearly
   series, while the decade 1976-1985 has lower values. Trends according to
   Mann-Kendall test do not present significant results except for March
   (decreasing) and July (increasing). The monthly and yearly series are
   fitted by the Gumbel distribution. The dependence of the previous
   results on the network density has been investigated. A second set of
   data has been selected by excluding about 20\% of stations in a uniform
   way, so that the mean distance between stations raises to about 12 km; a
   third set of data has then been obtained by excluding about 80\% of the
   stations, further increasing mean distance to 20 km. The previous
   analysis have been repeated with the two other sets. Comparison between
   the original data set and the second one by Wilkoxon-Mann-Whitney test
   shows that they are very similar; on the contrary the third one is very
   different. The fitting distributions of the original data set and of the
   second one are almost identical, while the fitting distributions of the
   third data set are very different. Different results have also been
   obtained for the third data set in the trend test.},

Abstract = {Smallholder farmers are the most vulnerable community to climate change
   in Ethiopia since they rely heavily on the subsistence rain-fed farming
   system. Thus, better climate change adaptation strategies need to be
   identified and implemented. This study aimed at identifying the farmers'
   perceptions of climate change and time series trend analysis of
   precipitation and temperature in northern Gondar Zuria District,
   Ethiopia. Data were gathered using a questionnaire from the
   institutional, socio-economic, and bio-physical situation of the 121
   sample households. The survey data were analyzed using SPSS software
   version 21, XLSTAT software, and excel spreadsheets. The climate change
   trend analysis was conducted using monthly precipitation, which has been
   downloaded from free online resources such as Global Precipitation. The
   temperature data were collected using the Climate Centre and Climate
   Research Unit with 0.5 by 0.5 degree resolutions from 1980 to 2013. The
   climate variable data have been analyzed using a precipitation
   concentration index, anomaly index, coefficient of variation, simple
   linear regression, and Mann-Kendall test. The result revealed that for
   the main rain season (summer), a statistically insignificant decreasing
   trend was obtained. In the Belg season, there was a growing trend of
   precipitation. The max monthly and annual temperatures have increased
   significantly over time. However, the min temperature trend shows a
   non-significant increasing trend over the 1980-2013 periods. The
   recorded monthly precipitation and temperature data trend analysis were
   similar to the farmers' perceptions of changes in temperature and
   rainfall over the past 30 years. Therefore, we recommend possible
   adaptation strategies designed for climate change. Particularly,
   countries whose economy is dependent on rain-fed agriculture should pay
   attention to the increasing trend of temperature and the decreasing and
   unreliable nature of rainfall.},

Abstract = {Information on spatial and temporal variation in rainfall and
   temperature pattern is of prime importance for understanding the climate
   dynamics and prerequisite for preparation of strategies to mitigate or
   adapt the ill impacts of potential future climate change on water
   resources, crop production and enhance resilience of vulnerable
   communities. In this study, five trend detection methods considering
   parametric tests {[}linear regression, Prais-Winsten AR, Pearson
   product-moment correlation coefficient (r)] and non-parametric tests
   {[}Spearman rank correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho) and
   Mann-Kendall test with Theil-Sen's slope] were considered. In addition,
   a new hybrid approach (Gaussian-linear trend detection test) to
   investigate the trends in historical rainfall and auto-segmented linear
   function for detecting trend in temperature of Upper Kharun Catchment
   (UKC), India, are introduced. Both parametric (except Gaussian-linear
   regression) and non-parametric test for trend analyses of annual
   rainfall (1961-2011) for the UKC shows non-significant trend. However,
   the Gaussian-linear trend analysis for peak (maximum) monthly rainfall
   amount in a year shows an increasing trend at the rate of 1.94mm per
   annum (p=0.05 level of statistical significance). At individual stations
   only Bhilai rainfall station shows a significant increase in monthly
   rainfall amount at the rate of 2.43mm (p=0.1) in August. Concerning
   trend detection of temperature, the results show no statistically
   significant trend for mean annual maximum, mean annual minimum and mean
   annual average temperature. However, a statistically significant slight
   increasing trend in temperature was detected in specific months.},

Abstract = {Hydrological and meteorological studies indicate that hydrological
   processes and water resources are significantly affected by the climate
   change, particularly with increasing greenhouse gases and temperature.
   In this study, the trend analyses of the biggest precipitation intensity
   values in Trabzon, the most populous province of the Eastern Black Sea
   Basin in Turkey, have been carried out by using Mann-Kendall and Sen's
   Innovative Trend methods. In line with this purpose; the precipitation
   intensity data of standard time series from 5 minutes to 24 hours for
   two meteorological stations in Trabzon (Trabzon and Akcaabat) were used.
   Before carrying out trend analyses, the Run (Swed Eisenhart) Homogeneity
   Test was applied to all data and non-homogeneous data were not analysed.
   Before applying the Mann-Kendall Method, the internal dependency of the
   data was examined. When the analysis results are reviewed; in Trabzon
   Meteorology Station an increasing trend for intensities of all-time
   series has been detected, whereas in the Akcaabat Meteorology Station, a
   general result of the trend could not be obtained as most the data
   related to different time series were not homogeneous data.},

Abstract = {Long-term changes in the interannual variation in summer seasonal
   {[}June-August (JJA)] precipitation over the tropical Asian summer
   monsoon (ASM) region were investigated using 22 simulations from phase 5
   of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) of the
   representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) run. Objective
   evaluations were performed with statistical tests to determine if there
   was an agreement among the multiple models. A robust increasing trend in
   fluctuations in the interannual variation in JJA precipitation over the
   ASM region was found. Expansions in both the wet and dry extremes of JJA
   precipitation anomalies were identified from the beginning to end of the
   twenty-first century, which were indicative of an intensification in
   interannual variation. These results indicate that the frequency and/or
   intensity of floods and droughts will likely increase under global
   warming. The spatial distribution of the projected expansion of wet and
   dry extremes differed over the ASM region. The signals in the wet
   extreme appeared throughout the whole ASM region, whereas those in the
   dry extreme were strong, particularly over the area from the Bay of
   Bengal to the equatorial western North Pacific, corresponding with the
   monsoon trough where the mean JJA precipitation increased.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study examined the trends in annual rainfall and temperature
   extremes over the Vea catchment for the period 1985-2016, using
   quality-controlled stations and a high resolution (5 km) Climate Hazards
   Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data. The CHIRPS
   gridded precipitation data's ability in reproducing the climatology of
   the catchment was evaluated. The extreme rainfall and temperature
   indices were computed using a RClimdex package by considering seventeen
   (17) climate change indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change
   Detection Monitoring Indices (ETCCDMI). Trend detection and
   quantification in the rainfall (frequency and intensity) and temperature
   extreme indices were analyzed using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK)
   test and Sen's slope estimator. The results show a very high seasonal
   correlation coefficient (r = 0.99), Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (0.98) and
   percentage bias (4.4\% and -8.1\%) between the stations and the gridded
   data. An investigation of dry and wet years using Standardized Anomaly
   Index shows 45.5\% frequency of drier than normal periods compared to
   54.5\% wetter than normal periods in the catchment with 1999 and 2003
   been extremely wet years while the year 1990 and 2013 were extremely
   dry. The intensity and magnitude of extreme rainfall indices show a
   decreasing trend for more than 78\% of the rainfall locations while
   positive trends were observed in the frequency of extreme rainfall
   indices (R1Omm, R2Omm, and CDD) with the exception of consecutive wet
   days (CWD) that shows a decreasing trend. A general warming trend over
   the catchment was observed through the increase in the annual number of
   warm days (TX90p), warm nights (TN90p) and warm spells (WSDI). The
   spatial distribution analysis shows a high frequency and intensity of
   extremes rainfall indices in the south of the catchment compared to the
   middle and northern of part of the catchment, while temperature extremes
   were uniformly distributed over the catchment.},

Abstract = {In this research, the precipitation data of 16 synoptic stations from
   1980 to 2014 in the south of Iran were used to evaluate the changes of
   the spatial and temporal pattern of drought based on the SPI index.
   Results of changes trend analysis in the temporal pattern based on
   linear regression (LR) showed that the most droughts occurred in the
   annual time scale (at 37.5\% of stations). Based on Mann-Kendall (MK)
   and Spearman's Rho (SR) tests, the most drought trends occurred in
   winter and annual time scales. Analysis of spatial pattern changes of
   drought showed that percent of areas in all classes of drought and
   all-time scales had non-significant changes (based on MK test),
   according to SR test, only the areas in moderate wet class of drought
   had a significant decreasing trend at 5\% level. Analysis of LR test
   showed that the percent of areas in all classes of drought in seasonal
   time scales had non-significant changes, in annual time scale severe dry
   and extreme dry classes had a significant decreasing trend at 5\% level.
   Generally, results showed that area percentage with dry classes had an
   increasing trend, therefore the study area is going to be drier and it's
   effective on agricultural activities, natural resources management,
   surface water resources and underground water resources planning and
   other activities.},

Abstract = {An evidence of a changing climate is already sensed in India where there
   is a large diversity from region to region and from season to season.
   The rainfall pattern in the pre-monsoon (March-April-May) season is
   important as it helps in determining many crop-related activities in
   many parts of the country. In the present study, an attempt is made to
   analyze the current trends in pre-monsoon season rainfall and
   temperatures over 34 meteorological subdivisions in India using the
   India Meteorological Department observed analysis datasets of rainfall
   (1951-2013) and temperatures (1981-2013). The results suggest that a
   significant decreasing trend in the pre-monsoon rainfall at all-India
   level and the maximum reduction is found in the month of March. From the
   regional scale analysis, the south peninsular India is found to have an
   increasing trend, whereas a decreasing trend is observed over Jammu and
   Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and northeast parts of the country. The
   analyses reveal an association of pre-monsoon rainfall over India with
   precipitation over China and temperature over the South China Sea, which
   may act as a precursor for the pre-monsoon rainfall that ultimately
   could affect the Indian summer monsoon rainfall. The increase of
   rainfall activity over south peninsular India is attributed to increases
   in the meridional temperature gradient with an increase of specific
   humidity. The results of the study will be useful for a long-term risk
   management in various sectors and would aid in adapting new technologies
   for a sustainable development in the changing climate scenario.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to examine the spatiotemporal variability and
   trends of rainfall and temperature in the northeast highlands of
   Ethiopia. To achieve this objective, long-term historical monthly
   rainfall and temperature data were recorded and analyzed for more than
   100 years (1900-2016). Gridded rainfall and temperature data were
   gathered from CenTrends Great Horn of Africa v1 and CRU\_TS 4.01 with a
   resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees and 0.50 x 0.5 degrees,
   respectively. The Mann-Kendall test was used to analyze the trends of
   rainfall data in different recording stations, and the Sen's slope
   estimator was used to determine the magnitude of change. The Inverse
   Distance Weighted spatial analysis tool was used to illustrate the
   spatial trends of rainfall and temperature. The results of the
   coefficient of variation revealed that the decadal, annual and seasonal
   rainfall distributions were varied though belg rainfall found to be more
   variable than the others. The MK test result demonstrated that belg and
   annual rainfall exhibit a decreasing trend as compared to kiremt
   rainfall. The distribution of kiremt, belg and annual rainfall
   demonstrated decreasing trends at a rate of 0.432, 0.335 and 0.595
   mm/year, respectively. The decadal rainfall also showed a decreasing
   trend at the rate of 6.537 mm/decade. On the other hand, the averages of
   annual, maximum and minimum temperature were increased at the rate of
   0.0034, 0.0028 and 0.0095 degrees C/year, respectively. The decadal
   minimum, maximum and average temperature has shown increasing trend at
   the rate of 0.098 degrees C, 0.041 degrees C and 0.069 degrees C,
   respectively. An abrupt declined rainfall and increased temperature were
   observed since the 1970s. Climate variability strongly affects rain-fed
   agriculture more than any other activities. Hence, policymakers and
   stakeholders have to give top priority in the designing and introduction
   of appropriate area-specific adaptive strategies to reduce the impacts
   on crop production over livelihood zones. Rainwater harvesting and the
   development of small-scale irrigation schemes could be taken as viable
   options where rainfall is scarce and more variable.},

Month = {2019 NOV 29},
Abstract = {Trends and spatial analysis of temperature and rainfall on rice yield in
   Nigeria was carried out. Forty year of past trends (1970-2010) was
   conducted with climate data obtained from the International Institute of
   Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria while upland rice yield data were
   obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization. Six cities, one in
   each of the six agro-ecological zones which were Calabar, Enugu, Ikeja,
   Ilorin, Kaduna, and Maiduguri were selected. Geographic information
   systems mapping for spatial analysis of temperature and rainfall over
   Nigeria was carried out. Mann-Kendall, Sens' tests, Pettitt's, and
   Buishand's tests and multiple linear regressions were used as
   statistical tools for analysis. Increasing rainfall trends in Enugu,
   Calabar, and Ikeja but decreasing trends were observed in Ilorin Kaduna
   and Maiduguri while temperature showed increasing trends in all the
   cities in the last four decades. Statistically significant positive
   trends of rice yield, rainfall, and temperature were observed in Ikeja
   and Maiduguri in the last four decades. Mann-Kendall tests showed that
   rice yield and temperature had generally statistically significant
   positive trends in Calabar Ilorin Kaduna, and Enugu while rainfall and
   yield were significant in Calabar Enugu but not significant in Ilorin
   and Maiduguri adaptation strategies to genetically modify rice varieties
   and effective water use strategies in areas of rainfall deficit are
   recommended to ensure food security.},

Title = {Five Decadal Trends in Averages and Extremes of Rainfall and Temperature
   in Sri Lanka},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {In this study, we used a comprehensive set of statistical metrics to
   investigate the historical trends in averages and extremes of rainfall
   and temperature in Sri Lanka. The data consist of 55 years (1961-2015)
   of daily rainfall, maximum temperature (T-max), and minimum temperature
   (T-min) records from 20 stations scattered throughout Sri Lanka. The
   linear trends were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test
   and Sen-Theil regression. The prewhitening method was first used to
   remove autocorrelation from the time series, and the modified seasonal
   Mann-Kendall test was then applied for the seasonal data. The results
   show that, during May, 15\% of the stations showed a significant
   decrease in wet days, which may be due to the delayed southwest monsoon
   (SWM) to Sri Lanka. A remarkable increase in the annual average
   temperature of T-min and T-max was observed as 70\% and 55\% of the
   stations, respectively. For the entire period, 80\% of the stations
   demonstrated statistically significant increases of T-min during June
   and July. The daily temperature range (DTR) exhibited a widespread
   increase at the stations located within the southwestern coast region of
   Sri Lanka. Although changes in global climate, teleconnections, and
   local deforestation in recent decades at least partially influence the
   trends observed in Sri Lanka, a formal trend attribution study should be
   conducted.},

Abstract = {Understanding the temporal inequality in precipitation is of great
   importance for water resource management, environmental risk management,
   and ecological conservation. This study investigated the spatial
   patterns and trends of the daily precipitation concentration over the
   Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin using the concentration index (CI) and the
   Lorentz asymmetric coefficient (LAC). A Mann-Kendall test and Hurst's
   rescaled range analysis were used to detect the change in CI trends. The
   CI ranged from 0.58 to 0.65, suggesting that a quarter of the rainiest
   days contributed approximately 69-78\% of the total precipitation. The
   LAC analysis indicated that the nonuniform distribution of precipitation
   was mainly attributed to a large proportion of days with light rainfall.
   Compared with that of the central region, the daily precipitation in the
   western and eastern regions was more irregular. At a seasonal scale, the
   dry season had a less homogeneous spatial distribution of CI compared to
   that of the wet season. Most areas exhibited no significant trends in CI
   from 1970 to 2017. A quarter of the stations presented a significant
   downward trend in CI, which were primarily found in the central and
   northern regions. In addition, the future trends of CI in most areas
   mostly agree with those of the current state; however, the majority of
   stations exhibited an uneven precipitation distribution in the dry
   season.},

Title = {A Case Study of Rainfall and Temperature Trends in San Diego Region,
   1985-2017},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Prolonged and frequent droughts in Southern California present hazards
   and uncertainty for the region's increasing population, resulting in
   proactive and aggressive water management strategies. The goal of this
   study is to present a case study of the San Diego region's rainfall and
   temperature time series analysis in order to determine annual and
   seasonal trends and their significance. Rainfall and temperature data
   from 20 rain-gauged stations were analyzed for the period 1985-2017. A
   project database was set up for data compilation and quality control,
   and a Mann-Kendall test for trend analysis was used. Results indicated
   that rainfall in the region decreased both annually and during the rainy
   season (November-April) by up to 0.14 mm between 1985 and 2017, although
   not in a statistically significant manner, except at two rainfall
   observation stations. Rainfall appears to have increased in many of the
   stations examined during the dry season (May-October), with an average
   magnitude of 0.09 mm. Analysis of daily minimum and maximum temperature
   reveals overall average annual and seasonal increases of 0.07 degrees C
   and 0.04 degrees C, respectively, with statistically significant
   increases at 10 of 17 for minimum temperature, and 0.27 degrees C and
   -0.25 degrees C with statistically significant increases at 9 of 16 for
   maximum temperature. Temperature tends to have increased more during the
   dry season compared to the rainy season. This study reveals an overall
   decreasing tendency in rainfall and an increasing tendency in minimum
   and maximum temperatures (although not statistically significant) in the
   San Diego region between 1985 and 2017, which likely contributed to
   important management implications for the region's water resources.},

Abstract = {Global warming and climate variability are emerging as the foremost
   environmental problems in the 21st century, particularly in developing
   countries. Ethiopia is one of the countries located in the sub-Sahara
   region and climate variability has a significant impact on the economy
   of the country. The aim of this study is to characterize annual and
   seasonal rainfall and annual temperature variability, and to measure
   trends on both the spatial and the temporal scale for ten selected
   stations in the Tana basin region, Ethiopia. The Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's slope estimator were used to assess trends and variability of
   rainfall and temperature. The spatial distribution of rainfall and
   temperature was determined using the inverse distance weighted
   technique. Results indicated that the amount of rainfall decreased for
   the majority of the stations. The annual rainfall showed significant
   decreasing trends with a magnitude ranging from -5.92 mm/year at
   Injibara to -9.74 mm/year in Wegera. However, a positive trend of annual
   rainfall was observed at Addis Zemen (1.81 mm/year). The minimum,
   maximum and mean temperatures have increased significantly for most of
   the stations. An increasing trend of annual maximum temperature was
   obtained between 1980 and 2015; an increase of 1.08 degrees C was
   observed.},

Abstract = {Due to inherent problems of water holding capacity of soil in the red
   and lateritic zone, the trend of climate change was assessed. Twenty
   rain gauge stations covering three districts (namely Bankura, Birbhum
   and Purulia) in the zone were considered to study the rainfall pattern.
   An increasing trend of yearly rainfall and shifting pattern of rainfall
   were observed in the said zone as a whole. The rainfall-during May
   decreased in most of the selected stations, where as in October the
   rainfall amount increased in 75\% cases and in November it increased in
   95\% cases. Analysis of maximum temperature data shows that average
   monthly temperature of summer months (April May) of 1990-2000 decreased
   marginally compared to that. of 1970-80 The minimum temperature of the
   zone, as a whole shows-an increasing trend.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal shifts in rainfall patterns over South Asia and the
   adjoining Seas during the pre-monsoon season have been observed over the
   past 2 decades from 2000 to 2019. Aerosol particles suspended above the
   boundary layer are a contributing factor to these changes. These
   particles not only alter cloud characteristics, but also diminish the
   lapse rate, thereby suppressing convective activity, leading to
   precipitation anomalies. Over the past 2 decades, high-rainfall regions
   have experienced declining rainfall, while low-rainfall regions have
   received increased rainfall. Coinciding with notable anomalies in
   precipitation, contrasting trends in aerosol optical depth, particularly
   due to absorbing aerosols in the elevated regions of the atmosphere, are
   seen. Apart from aerosols, several factors are considered that are
   critical in modifying precipitation patterns over the study region, such
   as water vapor content, convective processes, and lower-level relative
   humidity. We observed a potential transport of excess water vapor by
   ambient circulation from the oceanic regions having reduced rain, such
   as Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, to higher latitudes enabling
   precipitation anomaly at distant locations.},

Abstract = {Northern Chile is one of the most arid regions in the world, as it
   includes the Atacama Desert. At high elevations, most precipitation is
   observed only during a short period of the year, from December until
   March. This renders water availability a major concern for policymakers.
   Accumulated rainfall varies considerably from one year to another, and
   for this reason, climate projections have a very low degree of
   confidence in this area. Consequently, in this region, it is more
   interesting to study the irregularity of precipitation itself than
   accumulated rainfall values, as they express in a clearer way the
   behaviour of precipitation. According to daily data from 161
   meteorological stations, four irregularity indices of precipitation were
   calculated: concentration index, entropy, persistence index, and fractal
   dimension. These indices were measured according to observed values, and
   their spatial distribution was subsequently determined by interpolating
   following multivariate regression models that consider different
   geographical variables such as latitude, distance to the Amazon Basin,
   elevation, orientation, and curvature. The temporal trends of each index
   and for each meteorological station were also calculated, displaying
   different results depending on the latitude and elevation. These changes
   agree with the observed modifications on the inter-tropical atmospheric
   circulation and with changes in the precipitation diurnal cycle. These
   results will help improve climate projections for this region, in the
   process facilitating the development of more accurate climate models and
   informing the formulation of water management policies.},

Title = {Trend and concentration characteristics of precipitation and related

   India},

Abstract = {The Beas River, located in the Western Himalayan mountainous regions in
   India, is one of the major tributaries of the Indus River. However,
   recent changes of precipitation and related climatic teleconnections in
   this river basin have rarely been investigated yet. In this study, the
   trend and concentration characteristics of precipitation during
   1982-2010 are investigated by using Mann-Kendall trend test and two
   kinds of concentration indices. The climatic teleconnections are
   explored with the help of cross correlation, wavelet transform and
   composite analysis, revealing the relationship of precipitation with
   climatic indices of Indian summer monsoon (ISM), El Nino/Southem
   Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO). The results indicate that: (1) Precipitation of most
   of the stations increased in the monsoon season while precipitation of
   all the stations decreased in the non-monsoon seasons. As a result, the
   annual precipitation of the majority of the stations was on the
   decrease. (2) A general increase in the precipitation Gini coefficient
   and precipitation concentration degree (PCD) was detected. Moreover, the
   precipitation concentration period (PCP) is mainly within the period
   from May to August, and more PCP occurred in the monsoon months
   recently. (3) The relationship-between monsoon precipitation and ISM is
   not significant in the Beas River basin. The relationship between
   precipitation and ENSO in winter is less significant than in the monsoon
   season, and the relationship of monsoon/winter precipitation with IOD is
   not as evident as that with ENSO. Besides, ENSO and NAO play important
   roles in the changes of monsoon and winter precipitation in the Beas
   River basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Using observed daily precipitation data to classify five levels of rainy
   days by strength in South China (SC), with an emphasis on the Pearl
   River Delta (PRD) region, the spatiotemporal variation of different
   grades of precipitation during the period 1960-2010 was analyzed and the
   possible link with anthropogenic aerosols examined. Statistical analysis
   showed that drizzle and small precipitation has significantly decreased,
   whereas medium to heavy precipitation has increased slightly over the
   past 50 years (although not statistically significant). Further data
   analysis suggested that the decline in drizzle and small precipitation
   probably has a strong link to increased concentrations of anthropogenic
   aerosols produced by large-scale human activities related to the rapid
   socioeconomic development of the PRD region. These aerosols may also
   have led to the obvious decreasing trend in horizontal visibility and
   sunshine duration in SC, which is statistically significant according to
   the t-test.},

Abstract = {On the basis of daily precipitation records at 76 meteorological
   stations in the arid region, northwest of China, the spatial and
   temporal distribution of mean precipitation and extremes were analysed
   during 1960-2010. The Mann-Kendall trend test and linear least square
   method were utilized to detect monotonic trends and magnitudes in annual
   and seasonal mean precipitation and extremes. The results obtained
   indicate that both the mean precipitation and the extremes have
   increased except in consecutive dry days, which showed the opposite
   trend. The changes in amplitude of both mean precipitation and extremes
   show seasonal variability. On an annual basis, the number of rain days
   (R0.1) has significantly increased. Meanwhile, the precipitation
   intensity as reflected by simple daily intensity index (SDII), number of
   heavy precipitation days (R10), very wet days (R95p), max 1-day
   precipitation amount (RX1day) and max 5-day precipitation amount
   (RX5day) has also significantly increased. This suggests that the
   precipitation increase in the arid region is due to the increase in both
   precipitation frequency and intensity. Trends in extremes are very
   highly correlated with mean trends of precipitation. The spatial
   correlation between trends in extremes and trends in the mean is
   stronger for winter (DJF) than for annual and other seasons. The
   regional annual and seasonal precipitation and extremes are observed the
   step jump in mean in the late 1980s. Overall, the results of this study
   are good indicators of local climate change, which will definitely
   enhance human mitigation to natural hazards caused by precipitation
   extremes. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {A gridded data set with the size of 0.05 degree resolution
   (approximately 5.5km) which representing ground observations of daily
   rainfall and temperature of Peninsular Malaysia has been created over
   1975-2006. The integration and processing of the variety of data sources
   and data assessment is also presented. The 32-year period of the daily
   gridded rainfall and temperature data set were assessed to see how the
   daily mean rainfall and temperature have changed over time and space.
   Northeast monsoon (NEM) contributes more rainfall over the country
   compare to southwest monsoon (SWM). The rainfall trend during NEM is
   found significantly increased at the 95\% confidence level
   (7mm/season/year), meanwhile SWM rainfall does not pose any significant
   trends. Both NEM and SWM temperature trends show significant increasing
   trends at 95\% confidence level at 0.32 degrees C/decade and 0.31
   degrees C/decade, respectively over the 32-year period. A drastic
   increased of mean temperature (1.20 degrees C) was found in Klang Valley
   over the 20-year period. The mean decadal temperature was found
   consistently decrease as it approached the northern, east coast and

Abstract = {Trends and spatial analysis of temperature and rainfall on rice yield in
   Nigeria was carried out. Forty year of past trends (1970-2010) was
   conducted with climate data obtained from the International Institute of
   Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria while upland rice yield data were
   obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization. Six cities, one in
   each of the six agro-ecological zones which were Calabar, Enugu, Ikeja,
   Ilorin, Kaduna, and Maiduguri were selected. Geographic information
   systems mapping for spatial analysis of temperature and rainfall over
   Nigeria was carried out. Mann-Kendall, Sens' tests, Pettitt's, and
   Buishand's tests and multiple linear regressions were used as
   statistical tools for analysis. Increasing rainfall trends in Enugu,
   Calabar, and Ikeja but decreasing trends were observed in Ilorin Kaduna
   and Maiduguri while temperature showed increasing trends in all the
   cities in the last four decades. Statistically significant positive
   trends of rice yield, rainfall, and temperature were observed in Ikeja
   and Maiduguri in the last four decades. Mann-Kendall tests showed that
   rice yield and temperature had generally statistically significant
   positive trends in Calabar Ilorin Kaduna, and Enugu while rainfall and
   yield were significant in Calabar Enugu but not significant in Ilorin
   and Maiduguri adaptation strategies to genetically modify rice varieties
   and effective water use strategies in areas of rainfall deficit are
   recommended to ensure food security.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on annual air temperature has received a
   great deal of attention from climatologists worldwide. Many studies have
   been conducted to illustrate that changes in temperature are becoming
   evident on a global scale. Air temperature, one of the most important
   components of climate parameters, has been widely measured as a starting
   point towards the apprehension of climate change and variability. The
   main objective of this study is to analyse the temporal variability of
   mean monthly temperature for the period of 1941 to 2010 ( 70 years). To
   detect the magnitude of trend in mean monthly temperature time series,
   we have used non-parametric test methods such as The Mann-Kendall test,
   often combined with the Theil-Sen's robust estimate of linear trend.
   Whatever test is used, the user should understand the underlying
   assumptions of both the technique used to generate the estimates of a
   trend and the statistical methods used for testing. The results of this
   analysis reveal that four months -January, February, March and December
   -indicate a decreasing trend in average temperature, while the remaining
   eight months have an increasing trend. The magnitude of Mann-Kendall
   trend statistic Zc for this declining temperature and the magnitude of
   slope for the months of January, February and December are confirmed at
   the high significance levels of a = 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 respectively.
   Though, the overall trend is positive for monthly as well as seasonally
   efficient time series.},

Abstract = {There are well coherences between annual averaged air temperatures at
   every meteorological station along the Qinghai-Xizang railway, and its
   10-year moving average correlation coefficient is 0.92. Thus, the
   regional averaged annual mean temperature series along the
   Qinghai-Xizang railway (T-rw) from 1935 to 2000 are constructed. The
   investigation is suggested that: T-rw had significant responses to the
   5-year lagged sunspot cycle length (SCL) and 15-year lagged
   concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and the correlation
   coefficients between them are -0.76 (SCL) and 0.88 (CO2), respectively.
   The future SCL is predicted by the model of average generated function
   constructed with its main cycles of 76a, 93a, 108a, 205a and 275a. The
   result shows that the SCL would be becoming longer in the first half of
   the 21st century, and then it could be becoming shorter in the second
   half of the 21st century. Based on the natural change of SCL and the
   effect of double CO2 concentration, T-rw in the 21st century is
   forecasted. It could warm up about 0.50degreesC in the first half of the
   21st century compared with the last decade of last century. The mean
   maximum air temperature could be likely about 0.20degreesC in July and
   from 0.40degreesC to 1.10degreesC in January. The annual air temperature
   difference would likely reduce 0.3-1.00degreesC. The probability of
   above predictions ranges from 0.64 to 0.73.},

Title = {Trends in precipitation chemistry across the US 1985-2017: Quantifying
   the benefits from 30 years of Clean Air Act amendment regulation},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {247},

Abstract = {Acid rain was first recognized in the 1970s in North America and Europe
   as an atmospheric pollutant that was causing harm to ecosystems. In
   response, the U.S. Congress enacted Title IV of the Clean Air Act
   Amendments (CAA) in 1990 to reduce sulfur and nitrogen emissions from
   fossil fuel burning power plants. This study reports trends in
   wet-precipitation chemistry in response to emissions reductions
   implemented as part of the CAA. Trends were calculated for sulfate
   (SO4), nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) from 1985 to 2017 at 168
   stations operated by the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP);
   stations were divided into 9 regions across the United States. Trend
   analyses were conducted for three time periods: Period 1 (1985-1999),
   Period 2 (2000-2017), and the entire study period (1985-2017). Seasonal
   and regional Kendall trend analyses reveal significant decreasing trends
   in mean wet-precipitation SO4 concentrations in all 9 regions during the
   entire study period. The largest decreasing trends in monthly mean SO4
   precipitation-weighted concentrations were measured in the Mid-Atlantic
   (-1.29 mu eq/l/yr), Midwest (-1.15 mu eq/l/yr), and Northeast regions
   (-1.10 mu eq/l/ yr). The trends in monthly mean NO3 concentrations were
   not as strong as those for SO4, but all of the regions had significant
   decreasing trends in NO3 and again the Mid-Atlantic (-0.53 mu eq/l/yr),
   Midwest (-0.44 mu eq/l/yr), and Northeast regions (-0.50 mu eq/l/yr) had
   the strongest trends. Trends were steepest during Period 2 for SO4 and
   NO3, in fact for NO3 86\% of the stations had significant decreasing
   trends during Period 2 while only 8\% of the stations had significant
   decreasing trends during Period 1. The stations with the highest
   concentrations of SO4 and NO3 at the beginning of the study had the
   strongest decreasing trends and the relations were stronger during
   Period 2 than Period 1. For NH4, 22\% of the stations had statistically
   significant increasing trends in concentration during Period 1. The
   largest increasing trends in wet-precipitation NH4 concentration
   occurred in the North-Central region during Period 1, Period 2 and
   throughout the entire study. By comparison, NH4 trends in the
   Rocky-North and Rocky-South regions were about half as steep and trends
   in the South-Central and Midwest regions were about one-third as steep.
   We compared trends in SO4 and NO3 concentrations from NADP stations to
   emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, respectively to
   determine whether there was a relation between emissions and
   wet-precipitation concentration trends within proximity to NADP
   stations. There was a statistically significant relation (r(2) =
   0.62-0.69, p < 0.01) between the trend in SO4 concentrations at
   individual NADP stations and total and mean sulfur dioxide (SO2)
   emissions from power plants within a range of 750 km and 1000 km from
   each station. There were also significant relations between NO3
   concentration trends at NADP stations and power plant emissions of
   nitrogen oxides, but they were not nearly as strong (r(2) = 0.18-0.36, p
   < 0.01) as those for SO4 and were strongest for emissions within a range
   of 1000 km and 1500 km from each NADP station. Decreases in
   wet-precipitation SO4 concentrations were more consistent across regions
   and through time than decreases in NO3 and SO4 trends were more closely
   linked to stationary emissions sources than NO3 trends. There were
   statistically significant increases in NH4 wet-precipitation
   concentrations, as have been reported in previous studies, but this
   study found that those increases were strongest during Period 1 and were
   not consistent across the United States. During the first 3 years of the
   study period, wet-precipitation acidity was dominated by SO4 in 8 of the
   9 regions; by 2017 NO3 dominated the acidity of wet-precipitation in 7
   of the 9 regions. There has also been a downward shift in the NO3:NH4
   ratio of wet-precipitation as the emissions of nitrogen oxides have
   declined while ammonia emissions have remained essentially constant.
   This shift has resulted in an increase in wet-precipitation total
   nitrogen concentrations in 7 of the 9 regions and indicate that efforts
   to control NH3 emissions will become increasingly important as emissions
   of nitrogen oxides continue to decline.},

Abstract = {Nature of Precipitation - alkaline or acidic depends upon the
   concentration of major water soluble inorganic gaseous and soil derived
   particulates dissolved in it. If the concentration of cations is higher
   than that of anions the precipitations becomes alkaline and vice versa.
   pH is the main parameter indicating the nature of precipitation.
   If pH of rainwater <5.65 it is acidic and >5.65, it is alkaline,both in
   the pH scale ranging between 0 and 14. In this paper-average ionic
   concentration (mg/lit) and their trends have been analyzed. Srinagar,
   Mohanbari, Jodhpur, Allababad, Nagpur and Minicoy have been selected for
   the study of chemical precipitation during the period 1981-2001. Trends
   of different aerosols have been analyzed at the intervals 1981-87,
   1988-24 and 1995-2001. It has been observed that percentage of anions
   has increased which results in the increase of acidic character of the
   precipitation. During the interval 1995-2001, Nagpur and Mohanbari had
   pH values 5.16 and 5.47 respectively which were in acidic range.},

Abstract = {Mercury emissions in the USA declined between the 1990s and the
   beginning of this decade, largely due to the closure of municipal and
   medical waste incinerators. Declines in emissions have been greater in
   the Northeastern (NE) than the Midwestern (MW), and Southeastern (SE)
   regions of the eastern USA. During this time, global emissions of
   mercury have declined in Europe but have not declined in Asia and
   Africa. We have examined the patterns and trends in annual
   volume-weighted mean precipitation concentration for 33 Mercury
   Deposition Network (MDN) sites in the eastern USA, for the period
   1998-2005. Individual linear regressions indicate that, I I of 12 sites
   in the NE and all nine sites in the MW show declining patterns in
   mercury concentration, but only nine of these 21 sites show
   statistically significant downward trends (p<0.10). For the SE, seven of
   12 sites show a decreasing pattern, but only two sites show significant
   downward trends (p<0.10). Random coefficient models were used to test
   the trends in mercury concentration for each of the three regions as a
   whole. These results for the NE and the MW are statistically significant
   (p<0.01), and show annual declines of -1.70 +/- 0.51\% (S.E.) per year,
   and -3.52 +/- 0.74\% per year for the NE and MW, respectively. The SE
   region as a whole shows no significant trend in mercury concentration
   during the same period. Different mercury transformation and deposition
   processes in the SE may account for these results. A comprehensive
   mercury emissions record was not available for the same 1998-2005 time
   period as the precipitation concentration analysis. Therefore, while the
   empirical relation between changing regional mercury emissions and
   changing precipitation mercury concentrations is suggestive, it cannot
   be confidently assessed at this time. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The metropolitan area of Sao Paulo (MASP), with 18 million inhabitants,
   is one of the largest urban areas of the world, with serious
   environmental problems, including atmospheric pollution. Even though
   there is an official network monitoring the air quality, it does not
   include data on the chemical composition of precipitation. However, some
   research groups have sampled and measured common analytes in rainwater
   on several sites at MASP during restricted periods. Eventually,
   available data of pH values and ion concentrations in rainwater since
   1983 in the city of Sao Paulo have been compiled and are, now, discussed
   in this work, which, besides showing possible trends, gives support for
   future studies planned in MASP. A decreasing trend of rainwater free
   acidity in Sao Paulo occurred along the 2 decades considered. Since
   1995, no monthly volume weight mean (VWMm) pH values below 4.5 have been
   observed which, in part, reflects the gradual decrease in the
   atmospheric concentrations of the SO2, with annual average of 65 mu g
   m(-3) in 1983 and 15 mu g m(-3) in 2003. Scarce data on sulfate
   concentration in the rain shows a similar decay from 33 +/- 35 mu mol
   L-1 in 1989-1990 to 19 +/- 18 mu mol L-1 in 2002-2003. Despite the fact
   that no significant trends can be inferred in the limited nitrate
   database, for ammonium, high concentrations (47 +/- 42 mu mol L-1 of
   NH4+) have been - observed in recent years, indicating the contribution
   of the NH3 present in the Sao Paulo's atmosphere to the neutralization
   of the rain acidity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing Nonlinear Dynamics and Trends in Precipitation by Ensemble
   Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Fractal Approach in Benin
   Republic (West Africa)},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Climate dynamics and trends have significant environmental and
   socioeconomic impacts; however, in the Benin Republic, they are
   generally studied with diverse statistical methods ignoring the
   nonstationarity, nonlinearity, and self-similarity characteristics
   contained in precipitation time series. This can lead to erroneous
   conclusions and an unclear understanding of climatic dynamics. Based on
   daily precipitation data observed in the six synoptic stations of Benin
   Republic, in the period from 1951 to 2010, we have proposed (i)
   determining the local trends of precipitations, (ii) investigating
   precipitation nonlinear dynamics, and (iii) assessing climatic shift in
   the study period by Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and
   Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) method. To overcome
   the detrending issue in the standard MFDFA method, the EEMD algorithm is
   embedded into the MFDFA. The study period is subdivided into three
   subperiods: 1951-1970, 1971-1990, and 1991-2010. Intrinsic Mode
   Functions (IMFs) are obtained according to the climatic region in which
   the stations are located. Results show that precipitation variation is
   significantly governed by the five first IMFs, in which oscillation
   periods vary from 1 to 25 days. The trend curves decrease at all the
   synoptic stations, and their slope values vary accordingly to the
   subperiods. Referring to the values of the multifractal spectrum
   parameters, alpha 0, and the width of the spectrum w, consistent changes
   are observed regardless of the subperiods and the concerned stations.
   The spatial and temporal variability of precipitation indicates that the
   multifractal properties are good indicators for assessing changes in
   precipitation dynamics, and the changes in their features could be
   explained by the global change than by the local climate variation
   (climatic zones). Despite the observed differences in multifractal
   spectra properties from the three subperiods, it is not possible to
   verify the subdivision of 1951-2010 in three subperiods as it is done by
   previous studies in West Africa. Our findings can be used in the
   validation of global and regional climate models since a valid model
   should explain empirically detected scaling properties in observed data.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Based on the daily precipitation data from 53 meteorological stations,
   11 extreme precipitation indices were selected, categorized and
   calculated; the temporal and spatial patterns in these indices and their
   teleconnections with the large-scale circulations were analyzed by the
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test; and Sen's slope estimator and linear
   regression for the period of 1960-2014 were calculated. The results
   indicated that all extreme precipitation indices had spatial patterns
   decreasing from the southeastern to the northwestern parts of the
   Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Region (BTSSR), except for the consecutive
   dry days (CDD), which exhibited a reverse spatial pattern. At the
   whole-region scale, most extreme precipitation indices showed an
   insignificant decreasing trend, with exceptions in the intensity indices
   (RX1day and RX5day) with a statistical significance at the 90\%
   confidence level. The total annual precipitation showed a general shift
   towards a drier climate in the study area. Spatially, all indices for
   extreme precipitation showed decreasing trends at most stations, except
   for simple daily intensity index (SDII) and heavy precipitation days
   (R10). The change in extreme precipitation may be affected by the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Better understanding of extreme
   precipitation for the BTSSR may be useful in the regional planning for
   ecological restoration and water management.},

Title = {Evaluation of annual total precipitation in the transboundary

Abstract = {The Euphrates-Tigris River Basin (ETRB), one of the largest river basins
   in the Middle East, is also among the most risky transboundary basins in
   the world. ETRB has a critical importance for the region both
   politically and economically due to its location. Evaluating the
   increasing regional impacts of climate change is even more important for
   the sustainable management of water and soil resources, especially in
   transboundary basins such as ETRB. Turkiye is one of the most important
   riparian countries of the ETRB and the Turkiye part of ETRB constitutes
   the headwater of the basin. In this study, the temporal variability of
   the annual total precipitation data for the period 1965-2020 of eighteen
   stations located in the Turkiye part of the ETRB was investigated.
   Classical Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to statistically determine the
   monotonic trend of precipitation. In addition to the MK method, analyses
   were carried out with three innovative trend methods, which have the
   ability to interpret trends both statistically and graphically. These
   innovative trend methods are Sen innovative trend analysis (Sen-ITA),
   Onyutha trend test (OTT) and trend analysis with combination of Wilcoxon
   test and scatter diagram (CWTSD). The results obtained show that there
   is a decreasing trend in annual total precipitation in ETRB according to
   all trend methods generally used for the examined period. In addition,
   the results obtained from the relatively new OTT and CWTSD methods show
   strong consistency with the results of the other two methods. The
   advantages such as performing numerical and visual trend analysis with
   innovative OTT and CWTSD methods, identifying trends in low-medium-high
   value data and detecting sub-trends have shown that these methods can be
   used as an alternative to the widely used MK and Sen-ITA.},

Abstract = {An analysis of extreme daily precipitation events that occurred in the
   south-central United States during May and June 2010 is carried out
   using gridded station data and reanalysis products in use at the
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Various aspects of
   the daily extremes are examined from a climate perspective using a 62-yr
   (1948-2010) period of record, including their historical ranking, common
   circulation features, moisture plumes, and the possible influence of
   ENSO. The analysis also considers how the frequency and intensity of
   daily extremes is changing in the United States. Each of the 2010 flash
   flood events examined here was associated with historic daily rainfall
   totals. Several of the events had meteorological conditions in common at
   upper and lower levels of the atmosphere, and all of the events fit well
   into an existing classification scheme for heavy precipitation events
   associated with flash flooding. Each case exhibited characteristics of
   the ``Maya Express{''} flood events that link tropical moisture plumes
   from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico to midlatitude flooding over the
   central United States. Consistent with recent assessment reports, it is
   shown that extreme daily precipitation events in the United States have
   increased in frequency during the most recent 30-yr period (1980-2009)
   when compared to the previous 30-yr period (1950-79), though the
   increases are relatively small during May and June.},

   the time series' internal trend. An accurate database has been
   established thanks to the homogeneity of the data quality leading to
   rather satisfactory results with a precision of the spatial and temporal

Title = {Compiling non-parametric tests along with CA-ANN model for precipitation
   trends and variability analysis: A case study of Eastern India},
Journal = {WATER CYCLE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {71-84},
Abstract = {In the present research, mean monthly precipitation data have been used
   to analyze the existing trends of the precipitation for the periods of
   1981-2019 using non-parametric methods as the Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's Slope (beta). The results show a positive increasing trend in
   annual precipitation in the south whereas the central part of the study
   area recorded insignificant declining tends of precipitation over the
   last century. The maximum decrease in annual precipitation is detected
   in the Raiganj station (-0.286 mm/year). Alipore station recorded the
   maximum increase (1.354 mm/year) and the maximum decrease of monsoonal
   precipitation recorded in Malda station (-1.155 mm/year). The average
   coefficient value of all stations of winter is 72.83\% whereas
   seasonally the coefficient of variation is low as 19.21\% in monsoon
   time. The high coefficient value in winter (72.83\%), premonsoon
   (39.70\%), and post-monsoon (34.68\%) depicting the weather severity in
   the study area. For forecasting potential rainfall patterns CA-ANN
   method was utilized and the high kappa value of the forecasted maps
   illustrates the authenticity of the findings. The annual rainfall will
   notice a little of 0.26\% of rises in rainfall quantity from 2023 to
   2027 and the post-monsoon rainfall will experience a major decline of
   8.53\% by the year 2023. For the policymakers, this study significantly
   enhances the climatic knowledge regarding the study region and that can
   help in managing resources and overall development of this area.},

Title = {Impacts of the spatial extent of pollen-climate calibration-set on the
   absolute values, range and trends of reconstructed Holocene
   precipitation},
Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {178},

Abstract = {Pollen-based quantitative reconstructions of past climate variables is a
   standard palaeoclimatic approach. Despite knowing that the spatial
   extent of the calibration-set affects the reconstruction result,
   guidance is lacking as to how to determine a suitable spatial extent of
   the pollen-climate calibration-set. In this study, past mean annual
   precipitation (P-ann) during the Holocene (since 11.5 cal ka BP) is
   reconstructed repeatedly for pollen records from Qinghai Lake (36.7
   degrees N, 100.5 degrees E; north-east Tibetan Plateau), Gonghai Lake
   (38.9 degrees N, 112.2 degrees E; north China) and Sihailongwan Lake
   (42.3 degrees N, 126.6 degrees E; north-east China) using
   calibration-sets of varying spatial extents extracted from the modern
   pollen dataset of China and Mongolia (2559 sampling sites and 168 pollen
   taxa in total). Results indicate that the spatial extent of the
   calibration-set has a strong impact on model performance, analogue
   quality and reconstruction diagnostics (absolute value, range, trend,
   optimum). Generally, these effects are stronger with the modern analogue
   technique (MAT) than with weighted averaging partial least squares
   (WA-PLS). With respect to fossil spectra from northern China, the
   spatial extent of calibration-sets should be restricted to radii between
   ca. 1000 and 1500 km because small-scale calibration-sets (<800 km
   radius) will likely fail to include enough spatial variation in the
   modern pollen assemblages to reflect the temporal range shifts during
   the Holocene, while too broad a scale calibration-set (>1500 km radius)
   will include taxa with very different pollen-climate relationships. (C)

Abstract = {Understanding precipitation variations on various timescales and their
   correlations is important for assessment of flood risk and utilization
   of water resources. In this study, the spatial and temporal patterns of
   precipitation concentration in the upper reaches of the Huai River,
   China, were investigated using two indices: the precipitation
   concentration index (PCI) and the concentration index (CI) for measuring
   seasonality and daily heterogeneity using monthly and daily
   precipitation series, respectively. In particular, the trends of PCI and
   CI were tested by the Mann-Kendall method, and relationship among PCI,
   CI and percentage of precipitation contributed by the rainiest days was
   analyzed by the linear correlation analysis. The results show a
   significant seasonality of the rainfall distribution and very in
   homogeneous temporal distribution of the daily rainfall in the south
   part of the study area, especially in the three reservoirs. Positive
   trends in the PCI and CI were found at most stations, although none of
   the PCI trends were statistically significant. Daily heterogeneity of
   the rainfall in a year is highly correlated with the heavy rainfall
   amount of the 15 \% rainiest days, and seasonality in rainfall
   distribution over a year can be partly explained by the daily rainfall
   heterogeneity.},

Title = {Monthly precipitation trends on the Mediterranean fringe of the Iberian
   Peninsula during the second-half of the twentieth century (1951-2000)},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2009},

Abstract = {We analysed monthly precipitation trends on the eastern Mediterranean
   fringe of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) by means of a new monthly
   precipitation database {[}Monthly Precipitation Dataset, Mediterranean
   Spain (MOPREDA(MES))]. This database was created following an exhaustive
   quality control of the archives from the Meteorological Agency of Spain
   (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia, INM), and comprises 1113 complete
   and homogeneous monthly precipitation series (1951-2000), covering
   180000 km(2) (one-third of IP area). The new data set currently offers
   the highest spatial density of stations on the IP and around the
   Mediterranean Sea (1 station/150-200 km(2)), and includes available
   information at 1500 m asl.
   The analyses of monthly precipitation trends indicate high spatial and
   temporal variability. No global trend in the Study area was found.
   except for March, when significant negative trends affect the whole
   study area. Trends for winter months (December-January-February) are
   dominated by an East-West gradient with a latitudinal temporal shift.
   Positive trends are mainly located in coastland areas and negatives ones
   predominate inland. April shows a North-positive South-negative
   gradient, and the reverse is true for June and September. Negative
   trends are dominant in October over most of the study area, except for
   the Pyrenees area. July and August show the most complex spatial
   distribution pattern, with well-delimited areas of positive trends to
   the south and northwest. We generally detected no significant trends in
   May and November.
   In order to analyse the nature of rainfall variability in the study
   area, we also studied the synchronous influence of different
   low-variability modes {[}the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the
   Mediterranean Oscillation (MO) and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation
   (WeMO)]. On the Mediterranean fringe of the IP precipitation is mainly
   related to negative phases of the three low-frequency variability
   patterns analysed, and the MO and the WeMO emerge as predominant
   teleconnection patterns. These results suggest that monthly variations
   in rainfall may result from the simultaneous effects of different
   atmospheric modes of low variability, especially those linked to the
   Mediterranean region.
   Studies making use of high-density precipitation databases, as is the
   case in this paper, are useful for a better understanding of
   precipitation behaviour in a complex area like the Mediterranean fringe
   of the IP. The results also provide valuable information for downscaling
   and hydrological management. Copyright (C) 2008 Royal Meteorological

Abstract = {The paper presents the results of long-term measurements of rain
   chemistry in the woodland area of the Wielkopolski National Park
   (Western Poland) experiencing some human impact. The ions predominating
   in precipitation turned out to be those of ammonium and sulfates, which
   is indicative of human impact related with agriculture and animal
   breeding as well as with SO2 emissions. In the period 2002-2013 it is
   possible to identify, for both precipitation and throughfall,
   statistically significant decreasing trends in the concentrations and
   deposition of sulfates, ammonium and potassium, and an increasing trend
   for fluoride. Both bulk deposition and throughfall of N was higher than
   that of S. The deposition of nitrogen with throughfall was near to the
   critical load. High levels of acid-forming ions were observed in both,
   the winter and late-spring seasons, which proves not only the impact of
   heating but also of the local industry. Notable is the simultaneous
   occurrence of extremely high levels of acid-forming ions in some
   precipitation events, which might have many important implications for
   the soil, water and biota. There was a change in the pattern of
   atmospheric chemistry observed as a statistically significant downward
   trend in the rates of ionic concentration equivalents.},

Abstract = {Daily gridded (1A degrees x1A degrees) temperature data (1969-2005) were
   used to detect spatial patterns of temporal trends of maximum and
   minimum temperature (monthly and seasonal), growing degree days (GDDs)
   over the crop-growing season (kharif, rabi, and zaid) and annual
   frequencies of temperature extremes over India. The direction and
   magnitude of trends, at each grid level, were estimated using the
   Mann-Kendall statistics (alpha = 0.05) and further assessed at the
   homogeneous temperature regions using a field significance test
   (alpha=0.05). General warming trends were observed over India with
   considerable variations in direction and magnitude over space and time.
   The spatial extent and the magnitude of the increasing trends of minimum
   temperature (0.02-0.04 A degrees C year(-1)) were found to be higher
   than that of maximum temperature (0.01-0.02 A degrees C year(-1)) during
   winter and pre-monsoon seasons. Significant negative trends of minimum
   temperature were found over eastern India during the monsoon months.
   Such trends were also observed for the maximum temperature over northern
   and eastern parts, particularly in the winter month of January. The
   general warming patterns also changed the thermal environment of the
   crop-growing season causing significant increase in GDDs during kharif
   and rabi seasons across India. The warming climate has also caused
   significant increase in occurrences of hot extremes such as hot days and
   hot nights, and significant decrease in cold extremes such as cold days
   and cold nights.},

Abstract = {The lack of reliable rainfall projection records remains a major
   challenge to Uganda. In the advent of extreme wetness or drought events,
   reliable rainfall estimates for local planning and adaptation are
   essential. The present study used two main datasets to conduct a
   historical analysis from 1981 to 2019, coupled with future projections
   under representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) for the period
   2020-2050. Historical analysis revealed bimodal annual rainfall patterns
   for March-May (MAM) and September-November (SON) gradients representing
   heavier to lighter rainfall events, respectively, over the study area.
   Investigation of recent trends in rainfall patterns revealed an upward
   trend from 2010 onwards in annual and seasonal rainfall. Moreover,
   results for future projections show wet conditions are projected to
   occur over the study area between the months of April/May and October.
   Contrarily, March is likely to experience a reduction in wet conditions.
   Mann-Kendall test employed to make future projections of rainfall
   depicted decreasing patterns during MAM season whilst increasing
   tendencies with strong shift was highlighted for SON season over the
   study region. Meanwhile, annual projections indicate huge variations
   with linear trends showing a marginal increase as compared to historical
   trends. Findings would serve as baseline print to propel further studies
   that could delve into impact analysis of drought extreme events which
   pose significant threats to the agricultural sector which is heavily
   reliant on rainfall.},

Title = {Comparison of temporal trends from multiple soil moisture data sets and
   precipitation: The implication of irrigation on regional soil moisture
   trend},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {17-27},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this study, soil moisture trend during 1996-2010 in China was
   analyzed based on three soil moisture data sets, namely microwave-based
   multi-satellite surface soil moisture product released from European
   Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), ERA-Interim/Land
   reanalysis, and in-situ measurements collected from the nationwide
   agro-meteorological network. Taking the in-situ soil moisture as
   reference, it is found that ESA CCI generally captured soil moisture
   trend more accurately than ERA-Interim/Land did. From the spatial
   distribution of trend analysis results, it is seen that significant
   decreasing trend for summer soil moisture in northwestern China and
   northern Inner Mongolia, as well as the significant increasing trend for
   autumn soil moisture in northern China were identified by both ESA CCI
   and ERA-Interim/Land. This is in alignment with results from gauge-based
   precipitation provided by Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural
   Resources Research (IGSNRR) and satellite-based precipitation from
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). However, disagreements in
   derived trends between ESA CCI, ERA-Interim/Land and IGSNRR were
   observed in the southwest and north of China, especially in major
   irrigation regions, such as the oases in northern Xinjiang and large
   areas in Sichuan province. Prominent difference between soil moisture
   and precipitation exhibited in the extensively irrigated Huang-Huai-Hai
   Plain. The spatial coincidence between significantly wetting areas
   (identified by ESA CCI) and heavily irrigated areas, as well as the
   grid-based Student's t-test sampling from various irrigation levels
   revealed that the observed discrepancy was caused by massive
   anthropogenic interference in this region. Results indicate that, for
   regions with great magnitude of human interference, modules considering
   actual irrigation practice are crucial for successful modeling of soil
   moisture and capturing the long-term trend. Furthermore, results could
   provide insights on hindcast of historical irrigation areas using
   satellite-based precipitation and soil moisture data sets. (C) 2015

Title = {Characteristics of Dry and Wet Changes and Future Trends in the Tarim
   River Basin Based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
   Index},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Global changes in drought and wetness and their future trends in arid
   regions have recently become a major focus of research attention. The
   Tarim River Basin (TRB) in Xinjiang, China, is among the most
   climate-sensitive regions in the world. This study uses data from the
   past 60 years (1962-2021) to analyze the spatial and temporal features
   of drought and wetness conditions in the TRB, calculating the
   Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Trend
   detection for SPEI is performed using the BEAST mutation test,
   identification of drought events using the theory of operations, and
   spatial and temporal analyses of dry and wet changes using Empirical
   Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition. Additionally, the CMIP6 dataset
   is used to estimate future changes. The study results indicate the
   following: (1) From 1962 to 1998, the TRB exhibited a ``warm and wet{''}
   trend that suddenly shifted from ``wet-to-dry{''} in 1998 and
   subsequently transitioned to a pronounced ``warm and dry{''} trend. (2)
   After the ``wet-to-dry{''} shift, the frequency of drought events
   noticeably increased. The northern section of the basin witnessed more
   frequent drought events, albeit with lower severity, while the southern
   part had fewer occurrences but with higher severity. The spatial
   distribution of drought event frequency and severity is inconsistent.
   (3) The EOF decomposition results for SPEI-variable fields at 1-, 3-,
   and 6-month time scales show that the cumulative variance contribution
   rate of the first three principal spatial modal feature vectors exceeds
   70\%. The spatial distribution of the modes includes a consistent
   pattern across the entire basin, a north-south opposite pattern, and an
   east-west opposite pattern. (4) The future trend of drought in the TRB
   is expected to intensify, manifesting a spatial pattern characterized by
   dryness in the middle of the basin and wetness around the periphery.
   These research findings can provide support for decisions addressing
   regional drought risks.},

Abstract = {In situ observations of precipitation days (days when snow or rain was

   station on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula, and fields from
   the 40 year European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   re-analysis (ERA-40) project are used to investigate precipitation and
   atmospheric circulation changes around the Antarctic Peninsula. It is
   shown that the number of precipitation days is a good proxy for mean
   sea-level pressure (MSLP) over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea. The
   annual total of precipitation days at the station has been increasing at
   a statistically significant rate of +12.4 days decade(-1) since the
   early 1950s, with the greatest increase taking place during the summer
   and autumn. This is the time of year when the Southern Annular Mode
   (SAM) has experienced its greatest shift to a positive phase, with MSLP
   values decreasing in the Antarctic coastal zone. The lower pressures in
   the circumpolar trough have resulted in greater ascent and increased
   precipitation at Faraday/Vernadsky.},

Title = {Effects of large-scale climate anomalies on trends in seasonal
   precipitation over the Loess Plateau of China from 1961 to 2016},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {107},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The trends and cycles of seasonal precipitation at 77 stations over the
   Loess Plateau during the period of 1961-2016 were analysed in this
   study. The results indicate spatial differences in seasonal
   precipitation trends over the Loess Plateau from 1961 to 2016,
   suggesting that a decreasing trend in precipitation is found in most of
   the southern plateau in the spring and autumn, especially in Shaanxi
   Province. The changes in seasonal precipitation trends may indicate that
   there has been a shift in the seasonal hydrological cycle towards heavy
   spring precipitation and a much drier summer in the Loess Plateau. The
   magnitude of the downtrends means that regions with decreasing
   precipitation may become drier, which will exacerbate water scarcity in
   the region. The relationships between seasonal precipitation and
   large-scale climate anomalies indexes, including the western Pacific
   subtropical high index (WPSHI), the southern oscillation index (SOI) and
   the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), show that seasonal precipitation
   (except in the summer) over the Loess Plateau may be affected by ENSO,
   while summer precipitation in the southern and eastern is more are
   susceptible to the WPSH. Therefore, it will be better to predict trends
   in precipitation over the Loess Plateau with these relationships, which
   can provide valuable inputs to ecological restoration and water resource
   managers in these regions.},

   validated by comparison with ground station data. Extreme event maps
   were obtained from the use of high percentiles. Drought maps were
   obtained from the standardized precipitation index using low
   percentiles. The data were migrated to a geographic information system
   that allows interrelation with other geographic data. Its application to
   the study of the fortifications preserved in Andalusia classified all
   structures according to the level of exposure to these dangers and
   identified two areas of precipitation with different characteristics
   according to the influence of existing teleconnection patterns. Applied
   to the study of heritage landscapes, this methodological model minimizes
   the uncertainty associated with the use of satellite precipitation
   products, facilitates the planning of preventive conservation
   activities, and the management of existing resources in occurrence of
   extreme events.},

Abstract = {Precipitation samples have been collected by the National Atmospheric
   Deposition Program's (NADP) National Trends Network (NTN) using the
   Aerochem Metrics Model 301 (ACM) collector since 1978. Approximately
   one-third of the NTN ACM collectors have been replaced with N-CON
   Systems, Inc. Model ADS 00-120 (NCON) collectors. Concurrent data were
   collected over 6 years at 12 NTN sites using colocated ACM and NCON
   collectors in various precipitation regimes. Linear regression models of
   the colocated data were used to adjust for relative bias between the
   collectors. Replacement of ACM collectors with NCON collectors resulted
   in shifts in 10-year seasonal precipitation-weighted mean concentration
   (PWMC) trend slopes for: cations (-0.001 to -0.007 mgL(-1)yr(-1)),
   anions (-0.009 to -0.028 mgL(-1)yr(-1)), and hydrogen ion (+0.689
   meqL(-1)yr(-1)). Larger shifts in NO3- and SO4-2 seasonal PWMC trend
   slopes were observed in the Midwest and Northeast US, where
   concentrations are generally higher than in other regions. Geospatial
   analysis of interpolated concentration rasters indicated regions of
   accentuated variability introduced by incorporation of NCON collectors
   into the NTN. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Analysis of the Nonlinear Trends and Non-Stationary Oscillations of

   Empirical Mode Decomposition},

Abstract = {Changes in precipitation could have crucial influences on the regional
   water resources in arid regions such as Xinjiang. It is necessary to
   understand the intrinsic multi-scale variations of precipitation in
   different parts of Xinjiang in the context of climate change. In this
   study, based on precipitation data from 53 meteorological stations in
   Xinjiang during 1960-2012, we investigated the intrinsic multi-scale
   characteristics of precipitation variability using an adaptive method
   named ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Obvious non-linear
   upward trends in precipitation were found in the north, south, east and
   the entire Xinjiang. Changes in precipitation in Xinjiang exhibited
   significant inter-annual scale (quasi-2 and quasi-6 years) and
   inter-decadal scale (quasi-12 and quasi-23 years). Moreover, the
   2-3-year quasi-periodic fluctuation was dominant in regional
   precipitation and the inter-annual variation had a considerable effect
   on the regional-scale precipitation variation in Xinjiang. We also found
   that there were distinctive spatial differences in variation trends and
   turning points of precipitation in Xinjiang. The results of this study
   indicated that compared to traditional decomposition methods, the EEMD
   method, without using any a priori determined basis functions, could
   effectively extract the reliable multi-scale fluctuations and reveal the
   intrinsic oscillation properties of climate elements.},

Title = {On using a generalized linear model to downscale daily precipitation for

Abstract = {Portugal is on a climate change hot spot region, where precipitation is
   expected to decrease with important impacts regarding future water
   availability. As one of the European countries affected more by droughts
   in the last decades, it is important to assess how future precipitation
   regimes will change in order to study its impacts on water resources.
   Due to the coarse scale of global circulation models, it is often needed
   to downscale climate variables to the regional or local scale using
   statistical and/or dynamical techniques. In this study, we tested the
   use of a generalized linear model, as implemented in the program
   GLIMCLIM, to downscale precipitation for the center of Portugal where
   the Tagus basin is located. An analysis of the method performance is
   done as well as an evaluation of future precipitation trends and
   extremes for the twenty-first century. Additionally, we perform the
   first analysis of the evolution of droughts in climate change scenarios
   by the Standardized Precipitation Index in the study area. Results show
   that GLIMCLIM is able to capture the precipitation's interannual
   variation and seasonality correctly. However, summer precipitation is
   considerably overestimated. Additionally, precipitation extremes are in
   general well recovered, but high daily rainfall may be overestimated,
   and dry spell lengths are not correctly recovered by the model.
   Downscaled projections show a reduction in precipitation between 19 and
   28 \% at the end of the century. Results indicate that precipitation
   extremes will decrease and the magnitude of droughts can increase up to
   three times in relation to the 1961-1990 period which can have strong
   ecological, social, and economic impacts.},

Abstract = {This paper includes a study which applied homogeneity and trend tests on
   time series of monthly mean temperature and monthly total rainfall
   recorded in the provinces of Bartin, Bolu, Duzce, Kastamonu, Sinop, and
   Zonguldak of western Black Sea region in Turkey. The Runs test was used
   to check the homogeneity of both variables. Analyses were made using
   Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, Sen trend test, and linear trend test for
   the time period 1960-2017. According to the results of all tests,
   although monthly total rainfall of Bartin, Kastomonu, Sinop, and
   Zonguldak stations has inhomogeneous time series, Bolu and Duzce have
   homogeneous time series. The monthly mean temperature of all stations
   has no homogeneity. Although Kastamonu and Sinop have statistically
   significant increasing trends according to the linear trend test, other
   provinces have no statistically significant trends for both variables.
   There are no statistically significant trends for both variables in all
   stations according to the MK trend test; however, there are
   statistically significant increasing trends for monthly mean temperature
   in all stations according to the Sen trend test. Monthly total rainfall
   of Duzce (17072) has a statistically significant decreasing trend at
   95\% confidence interval; other stations have statistically significant
   increasing trends according to the Sen trend test.},

Abstract = {It is well known that any kind of ordinary hydrometeorological parameter
   trend may have increasing or decreasing tendency systematically. Various
   methodologies are developed for possible trend identification such as
   the well-known Mann-Kendall test and recently Sen innovative trend
   analysis (ITA) approaches. The former has a set of assumptions, whereas
   the latter is almost without any restrictive assumption. The main
   purpose of this paper is to present precipitation and temperature trend
   behaviors by applying ITA in Yesilirmak drainage basin. Selected
   observation stations are mainly located at the Black Sea confluence
   region of Yesilirmak while few others at the middle and upper drainage
   basins. ITA provided visual inspection with quantitative trend slopes
   distinctively for low, medium, and high sub-levels with physical
   interpretations. Based on categorization, precipitation records have
   significant decreasing trends in low, medium, and high levels as an
   average - 3.4\%, - 3.8\%, and - 2.4\%, respectively. In contrary to
   precipitation trend, and consistent to global expectation in climate
   change, temperature records have significantly strong increasing
   tendency along the basin. In sub-level of temperature, this strong trend
   tendencies are detected + 4.6\%, + 4.8\%, and + 7.2\% from low to high

Abstract = {Trends in mean monthly temperature in four agro-climatic zones of India
   have been studied using climate data for the period of 1901 to 2002. The
   Non-Parametric, Mann-Kendall Test has been applied to investigate the
   significance of trend over the years for four agro-climatic zones. The
   results were cross-checked with those obtained from Spearman's rank
   statistic and deterministic trend analysis. The investigation reveals
   that in all the zones, annual mean temperature is significantly
   increasing. The maximum increase in annual mean temperature is in zone 3
   with a tune of 0.3 degrees centigrade in the last century. The results
   also reveal that the winter months, i.e., November to January are
   becoming hotter in all four agro-climatic zones. The monthly mean
   temperature for zone 1 and 3 is increasing in all the months; on the
   other hand it is decreasing in June-September in zone 2 and 4 and
   increasing in other months.},

Abstract = {Long-term variability and trends in global stratospheric temperature are
   described, based on radiosonde observations since the 1960s and
   satellite measurements since 1979. New radiosonde-based data sets are

   these data show good agreement with satellite measurements in the lower
   stratosphere. The stratosphere exhibits well-known transient warming
   linked to large volcanic eruptions, plus long-term cooling with
   magnitudes similar to-0.5 K/decade in the lower stratosphere to similar
   to-1.2 K/decade in the upper stratosphere. Observations of stratospheric
   water vapor are also analyzed, based on satellite measurements for
   1993-2010. Observed interannual variability is dominated by the
   quasi-biennial oscillation, plus a step-like drop after 2001. For the
   observed satellite record, variability in stratospheric water vapor is
   closely tied to temperature anomalies near the equatorial cold point
   tropopause.},

Title = {Influence of temperature, rainfall and wind trends on grass pollination
   in Malaga (western Mediterranean coast)},

Abstract = {In the Mediterranean region respiratory allergies due to Poaceae pollen
   have increased during the last few decades despite the fall in
   atmospheric grass pollen levels recorded in some cities. We study
   whether airborne grass pollen trends have increased or decreased in a
   coastal city of the Mediterranean Basin, analysing not only annual and
   spring amounts but also phenological trends. We look to climatic change
   as the possible cause of any of these tendencies, without forgetting
   possible changes in land use in recent years. Since 1970s, Malaga has
   seen its annual mean temperature rise by 0.06 degrees C/year. Some
   meteorologists have observed certain tendencies in the rainfall of the
   western Mediterranean area. As regards winds (barely studied), the
   frequency of calm has decreased and ``levant winds{''} blowing off the
   sea have become more frequent, while SW winds have decreased in spring.
   The object of this contribution, then, is to analyse and individually
   explain the relation between (and possible influence of) each
   significant climatic trend and each significant atmospheric pollen
   trend. We have considered as significant the trends (regression lines)
   whose fitted points, determined by R(2), provided a p value of <= 0.05.
   We have obtained important results that allow us to explain the
   influence of certain climatic factors on the growth and pollination of
   these plants. During the springs of 1992-2007 there was a significant
   tendency for airborne grass pollen levels to increase, the number of
   days with high atmospheric concentrations (>100 grains/m(3) air) also
   increasing, which would explain the increase in allergenic illnesses
   (pollinosis) recorded in the population of Malaga. This increased amount
   of spring pollen is associated with higher than usual rainfall and
   minimum temperatures during early spring (March and April), which would
   favour seed germination and vegetative growth in these plants. The
   increased rainfall of early spring is also associated with the tendency
   for pollination to start later. Lastly, the end of pollination was
   brought forward significantly, with the consequent shortening of the
   overall pollination season by 1 week/year. This fact is significantly
   associated with the frequency of spring winds (more wind from directions
   unfavourable for pollen registration and fewer winds from favourable
   directions) and also with the tendency for the springs to be warmer,
   leading to plant wilting and parching. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},

Volume = {170},

Abstract = {Recent global warming has not been ubiquitous: there are seasons,
   regions, and time periods with negligible or even negative air
   temperature trends (frequently referred to as warming holes). This paper
   presents a novel method enabling a proper localization of specific trend
   events, such as periods of warming holes, of a particularly strong
   warming, and of rapid transitions of trend amplitudes during the
   calendar year. The method consists in analyzing trends for periods of a
   given length (10 to 90 days) that are sliding over the year with a one
   day step. This allows a detailed description of the annual cycle of
   trends. The analysis is conducted for daily maximum and minimum
   temperature at 135 stations in Europe in 1961-2000. Despite an overall
   warming in Europe, several warming holes are uncovered during various
   parts of the year, not only in autumn when a warming hole has already
   been reported. The autumn warming hole concentrates in Eastern Europe,
   but it changes its strength and spatial extent: it spreads into Western
   Europe in September and retreats to Eastern Europe in November when it
   intensifies especially north of the Black Sea. Three shorter warming
   holes are detected: In February and March, cooling occurs in the Eastern
   Mediterranean and Iceland, while in early April, cooling is detected
   over Central, Southern, and Southeastern Europe. Another large-scale
   cooling occurs in Central, Northern, and Northwestern Europe in
   mid-June. The periods of strongest warming occur around the middle of
   January in Eastern Europe, in early March over almost entire Europe, and
   in mid-May and early August mainly over Central and Western Europe.
   Cluster analysis of stations with respect to the annual cycles of trends
   demonstrates a spatial coherence of the trends; the lack of spatial
   coherence points to local peculiarities or data problems of individual
   stations. The method of sliding seasons proves to be much more effective
   in the identification and localization of notable trend events than the
   ordinary approach of trend detection for fixed calendar seasons and/or
   months.},

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-63},
Abstract = {We examined the seasonal trends of mean and extreme temperatures in Hong
   Kong using data from 1885-2010. The analysis revealed that the daily
   maximum temperature (T-Max), daily mean temperature (T-Mean), and daily
   minimum temperature (T-Min) of Hong Kong had a significant long-term
   increasing trend in all 4 seasons and that the warming trend was more
   prominent in winter and spring. The relatively higher rate of increase
   in temperatures in winter and spring could be attributed to local
   urbanization effects and the weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon
   in the last few decades. For extreme indices, we observed a significant
   increase in the hot indices (TN90p and TX90p) and a significant decrease
   in the cold indices (TX10p and TN10p) in all seasons. The seasonal
   variations in the heating and cooling degree-days (HDD and CDD) also
   indicated that CDD in spring, summer, and autumn had a significant
   increasing trend, while HDD in spring, autumn and winter had a
   decreasing trend. Analysis of the hot and cool periods in Hong Kong
   showed a significant decreasing (increasing) trend in the number of cool
   (hot) days. Also, the cool (hot) period has become shorter (longer) over

Abstract = {Determining whether Global Average Temperature (GAT) is an integrated

   function is crucial for detection, attribution, impact, and forecasting

   Our micro-founded evidence suggests that GAT is stationary around a

   breaks on individual grids and the standard aggregation method under

Abstract = {In our research work, we used quantile regression analysis to find out
   the trend of the temperature of Bangladesh and to calculate the
   forecasted temperature for different areas. Different established
   methods were used earlier but because of the existence of extreme
   values, quantile regression is preferred compared to linear regression
   and other methods. Here we used average, maximum and minimum
   temperatures from 1990 to 2013 at eight different stations of
   Bangladesh. Dhaka and Mymensingh stations represent central region,
   Barisal and Feni represent southern region, Rangpur station represents
   northern region, Rajshahi represents north western region, Khulna
   represents west southern region and Sylhet station represents north
   eastern region. Data is collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological
   Department (BMD). Temperature of an area changes with seasons. So we
   used moving average method and deseasonalization to make the data
   linear. After removing seasonal variation and employing quantile
   regression, the results showed that the temperature of Bangladesh is
   increasing significantly year by year which is an alarming sign. Among
   these eight stations, the rate of change of temperature is highest for
   Sylhet station. We also analyzed seasonal adjusted forecast and the
   predictions of temperatures were cross checked with the observed
   temperatures of previous years.},

Abstract = {The impact of the global sea surface temperature (SST) warming trend,
   which is the leading mode of SST variability, on late summer Asian
   rainfall is analyzed based on the simulations of five atmospheric
   general circulation models, which are performed by the U. S. Climate
   Variability and Predictability Drought Working Group. Our evaluations of
   the model outputs indicate that these models roughly capture the main
   features of climatological rainfall and circulations over Asia and the
   western North Pacific (WNP), but they simulate a too strong monsoon
   trough and a too northward shifted in the subtropical anticyclone in the
   WNP and fail to reproduce the rain belt over East Asia. It is found that
   all of the models simulate an intensified WNP subtropical high (WNPSH)
   in late summer, an enhanced precipitation in the tropical Indian Ocean
   and the maritime continent, and a suppressed precipitation in the South
   Asian monsoon region, the South China Sea, and the Philippine Sea, when
   the models are forced with the SST trend, which is characterized by a
   significant increase in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific. All these
   changes are suggested to be dynamically coherent. The warmer SST trend
   in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific may suppress precipitation over
   the Philippine Sea and thus result in a lower tropospheric anticyclonic
   circulation over the subtropical WNP. The warmer SSTs in the Indian
   Ocean may also be responsible for the anomalous easterlies and resultant
   less rainfall over the South Asian monsoon region. The precipitation
   changes forced by the SST trend are similar in the maritime continent
   but show an apparent difference over East Asia, in comparison with the
   observed rainfall trend over lands. The possible reasons for this
   difference are discussed.},

Title = {Temporal and spatial evolutionary trends of regional extreme
   precipitation under different emission scenarios: Case study of the
   Jialing River Basin, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {617},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Exploration of the temporal and spatial evolutionary trends of future
   extreme precipitation under different emission scenarios is of
   considerable importance for promoting active response to climate change.
   Based on the output of CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) with four
   Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), precipitation data for the Jialing
   River Basin (China) were obtained through CMhyd downscaling and
   correction. A relative threshold of 95 percentile of each year was used
   to extract extreme precipitation in the basin, and historical
   observational data were used to verify the capability of the GCMs to
   simulate extreme precipitation. Based on Extreme-point Symmetric Mode
   Decomposition, the trends and periodic characteristics of future extreme
   pre-cipitation in the Jialing River Basin under four different emission
   scenarios (SSP2.6, SSP4.5, SSP7.0, and SSP8.5) were simulated and
   analyzed. The future temporal and spatial distributions of extreme
   precipitation frequency and intensity in different periods were
   described. The results revealed the following. (1) Future extreme
   pre-cipitation in the Jialing River Basin is likely to increase with
   rates of 21.8 mm/10a, 11.4 mm/10a, 8.7 mm/10a, and 8.3 mm/10a for
   SSP8.5, SSP 7.0, SSP4.5, and SSP2.6, respectively. (2) The frequency of
   extreme precipi-tation decreased in the whole basin with a 1-day
   decrease of 3.88 \% (SSP8.5), 7.11 \% (SSP7.0), 5.66 \% (SSP4.5), and
   2.40 \% (SSP2.6) from historical levels. (3) The intensity of extreme
   precipitation increased with a 1-day increase of 11.18 \% (SSP8.5), 6.80
   \% (SSP7.0), 5.04 \% (SSP4.5), and 4.57 \% (SSP2.6) from historical
   levels. Over time, the change of extreme precipitation showed strong
   periodic characteristics with three periodic components of 2-3, 4-6, and
   9-12 years. In terms of spatial distribution, the frequency (intensity)
   center of extreme precipitation in the next 80 years will be distributed
   in the south (southeast) of the basin. Compared with historical
   observations, the area of extreme precipitation intensity in the future
   accounted for a larger proportion, while the area of extreme
   precipitation frequency accounted for a smaller proportion. In terms of
   increased emission levels, the extreme precipitation frequency would
   decrease and the intensity would increase. The conclusions of this study
   could provide a reference for disaster prevention and mitigation of the
   effects of extreme precipitation under future climate change.},

Abstract = {Ethiopia gets its agricultural water primarily from rainfall. This study
   was intended to investigate current climate variability and trends
   across space and time. Daily gridded temperature and rainfall data from
   1993 to 2022 in the Hulbarag district, Silte Zone of Ethiopia was
   obtained from the Ethiopian National Metrological Institute and the
   Climate Hazard Group Infrared Precipitation with Station. The trends and
   variability of temperature and rainfall were analyzed using the
   Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen's slope, coefficient of variation,
   precipitation concentration index, and rainfall anomaly index. The
   results indicated that annual, spring, and summer rainfall revealed
   statistically significant decreasing trends at Hulbarag and Sankura
   stations, with the magnitude of -13.4, -11.6, and -10.6 mm per year and
   -6.8, -3.6 and -10.9 mm per year respectively. Conversely, autumn and
   winter season rainfall showed statistically significant increasing
   trends at Hulbarag and Sankura stations, with the magnitude of 5.1 and
   5.5mm per year and 3.4 and 1.84mm per year consecutively. Between 43 \%
   and 47 \% of the observation periods had negative anomalies. The average
   yearly temperature, average yearly minimum temperature, and average
   yearly maximum temperatures at Sankura and Fonko stations all displayed
   statistically significant increasing trends, with a magnitude of 0.091
   degrees C, 0.009 degrees C and 0.051 degrees C per year and 0.03 degrees
   C,0.01 degrees C and 0.0022 degrees C per year successively. It is
   advisable to develop a farming system that is climate-resilient by
   improving the adaptive capacity of wheat and maize-growing farmers by
   expanding the availability of early maturing seeds, changing crop
   calendars, and enhancing proactive and credible climate information
   services.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 6},
Abstract = {Detecting changes in climate is a prerequisite for a better
   understanding of the climate and developing adaptation and mitigation
   measures at a regional and local scale. In this study long-term trends
   in rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature (T-max and T-min) were
   analysed on seasonal and annual time scales for East Africa. High
   resolution gridded rainfall (1981-2016) and temperature (1979-2010) data
   from international databases like the Climate Hazards Group are used.
   Long-term seasonal trend analysis shows a non-significant (except for
   small areas), decreasing (increasing) trend in rainfall in eastern
   (western) parts of Ethiopia and Kenya and a decreasing trend in large
   parts of Tanzania during the long rainy season. On the other hand, a
   non-significant increasing trend in large parts of the region is
   observed during the short rain season. With regard to annual trends,
   results largely confirm seasonal analyses: only a few significant trends
   in rainfall, but significant increasing trends in T-max (up to 1.9
   degrees C) and T-min (up to 1.2 degrees C) for virtually the whole
   region. Our results demonstrate the need and added value of analysing
   climate trends based on data with high spatial resolution allowing
   sustainable adaptation measures at local scales.},

Abstract = {Since historical times, the climate of the earth has been changing. In
   terms of diversity and population, India is a vast country. Any
   significant change in its climatic conditions can have an impact on the
   country's entire economic and cultural structure. Temperature is the
   most important variable when focussing on climate change study. This
   study aims to recognise the changing trend of temperature in India. For
   this purpose, temperature data from 1901 to 2020 has been analysed. To
   find out the variability in temperature, various statistical tools were
   applied. The Mann-Kendall method has been used along with Sen's slope
   estimator for determining the trend and slope magnitude. ARIMA modelling
   is applied to the data series to forecast the temperature trend. The
   study has shown that variability in temperature is increasing in recent
   years and the temperature trend is increasing in all the months,
   especially in the cold months of November, December and January. The
   average annual temperature of India in the year has increased
   significantly in the past 120 years. The trend analysis of temperature
   is tested significantly statistically at a 95\% confidence level.},

   the ensemble size further would not dramatically improve confidence in

Title = {What's the temperature tomorrow? Increasing trends in extreme volatility
   of daily maximum temperature in Central and Eastern United States
   (1950-2019)},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Several studies have recently shown that rapid changes in temperature
   are linked to higher mortality and hos-pitalization rates, increased
   risk of respiratory epidemics and lower economic growth. Here, we
   present the first continental-scale analysis of day-to-day variability,
   defined as volatility, of daily maximum temperature across the
   contiguous United States for the period (1950-2019). We first outline
   spatial patterns of climatology, sea-sonality and directionality
   (increase vs. decrease) in volatility using data from 1,484 ground
   stations. Next, we investigate the existence of trends in the magnitude
   of extreme volatilities where it is found that most stations in Central
   US exhibit a statistically-significant increasing trend of approximately
   0.2-0.3 C/decade in magnitude of volatility. Furthermore, we compare
   these results with those obtained from two reanalysis data sets and one
   gridded (station-based) data set. Although reanalysis data sets
   adequately capture spatial variability of volatility, they underestimate
   the magnitude of volatility and fail to reproduce observed trends which
   might be attributed to deficiencies in numerical weather prediction
   models. Overall, these findings pinpoint changes in volatility of daily
   maximum temperature as a potential manifestation of climate change.},

Abstract = {Based on the latest series of homogenized ground surface temperature
   (GST) and surface air temperature (SAT) data for China, this study
   performed a detailed analysis of the trend of the differences between
   the two homogenized series in 1961-2016. The differences, referred to as
   surface-air temperature differences (SATDs) in this study, were
   separately averaged by month, season, and year. The long-term and
   spatial changes in the trends of SATDs were investigated. Moreover,
   interdecadal trend breakpoints were identified to understand the
   characteristics of trends in fluctuation. The possible influences of
   precipitation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and global warming on
   SATDs were also analyzed. The results showed that during the 12 months
   of a year, only three months, March, April, and May, exhibited
   increasing trends of station-averaged, monthly mean SATDs while the
   other nine months exhibited decreasing trends. In addition, the
   station-averaged annual and seasonal mean SATDs of summer, autumn, and
   winter all showed significant decreasing trends, while the spring mean
   SATDs showed a significant increasing trend. The spatial distribution
   pattern of the linear trends of monthly, seasonal, and annual SATDs in
   meteorological stations indicated that SATDs had more obviously
   increasing trends in the northern regions than the southern regions of
   China. The trends of station-averaged monthly mean SATDs (except for
   April) and station-averaged seasonal and annual mean SATDs experienced
   interdecadal breakpoints, fully indicative of obvious interdecadal
   fluctuations with temporal complexity among China's SATD trends. By the
   regression analysis of monthly STADs against simultaneous precipitation,
   as well as the comparative analysis of their linear trends, we found
   that both amount of precipitation and the change of precipitation type
   have important influences on SATDs. The results of convergent cross
   mapping analysis also revealed the causal effect of precipitation on
   SATDs.},

Abstract = {In light of recent reductions in sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) emissions
   mandated by Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, temporal
   trends and trend coherence in precipitation (1984-2001 and 1992-2001)
   and surface water chemistry (1992-2001) were determined in two of the
   most acid-sensitive regions of North America, i.e. the Catskill and
   Adirondack Mountains of New York. Precipitation chemistry data from six
   sites located near these regions showed decreasing sulphate (SO42-),
   nitrate (NO3-), and base cation (CB) concentrations and increasing pH
   during 1984-2001, but few significant trends during 1992-2001. Data from
   five Catskill streams and 12 Adirondack lakes showed decreasing trends
   in SO42- concentrations at all sites, and decreasing trends in NO3-,
   C-B, and H+ concentrations and increasing trends in dissolved organic
   carbon at most sites. In contrast, acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC)
   increased significantly at only about half the Adirondack lakes and in
   one of the Catskill streams. Flow correction prior to trend analysis did
   not change any trend directions and had little effect on SO42- trends,
   but it caused several significant non-flow-corrected trends in NO3- and
   ANC to become non-significant, suggesting that trend results for
   flow-sensitive constituents are affected by flow-related climate
   variation. SO42- concentrations showed high temporal coherence in
   precipitation, surface waters, and in precipitation-surface water
   comparisons, reflecting a strong link between S emissions, precipitation
   SO42- concentrations, and the processes that affect S cycling within
   these regions. NO3- and H+ concentrations and ANC generally showed weak
   coherence, especially in surface waters and in precipitation-surface
   water comparisons, indicating that variation in local-scale processes
   driven by factors such as climate are affecting trends in acid-base
   chemistry in these two regions. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons,

   and a northward (southward) shift in mean station location in the CDD
   correspond with decreases (increases) in temperature. Although the
   movement of station locations in the CDD showed only modest impacts on
   trends, the effects of the movements are statistically significant, and
   explain some of the variances in the temperature trends. Results
   therefore suggest that climate divisions with more rugged terrain and
   greater shifts in elevation are more susceptible to spuriously generated
   trends.},

Title = {Distribution and temporal trends of temperature extremes over Antarctica},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature extremes over
   Antarctica remain largely unknown. Here, we use quality-controlled daily
   datasets from Antarctic weather stations to show that the annual maximum
   and minimum temperatures exhibit a decreasing pattern over Antarctica
   from the coast to inland regions. This feature holds for the warmest
   daily maximum and coldest daily minimum temperatures, which define the
   intensity of extremes, but not for the number of warm (cold) days
   measuring the frequency of extremes, which show limited dependence on
   latitude or elevation. During 1970-2000, the temperature extremes in the
   South Orkney islands and on the margins of East Antarctica show opposite
   trends, especially with a significant increasing and decreasing trend in
   warm events, respectively. During 1999-2013, the intensity and frequency
   of extreme temperatures decrease significantly over West Antarctica, but
   the trends vary greatly across sub-regions of Antarctica. Despite the
   limited number of stations and the potential time dependence of trends,
   these results not only help to decipher the climate regimes of
   Antarctica and fill current gaps in the map of global climate extremes,
   but also may guide the future design of Antarctic observational networks
   and be used to assess the capability of reanalysis datasets and climate
   models.},

Abstract = {Radiative and dynamical heating rates control stratospheric
   temperatures. In this study, radiative temperature trends due to ozone
   depletion and increasing well-mixed greenhouse gases from 1980 to 2000
   in the polar stratosphere are directly evaluated, and the dynamical
   contributions to temperature trends are estimated as the residual
   between the observed and radiative trends. The radiative trends are
   obtained from a seasonally evolving fixed dynamical heating calculation
   with the Parallel Offline Radiative Transfer model using four different
   ozone datasets, which provide estimates of observed ozone changes. In
   the spring and summer seasons, ozone depletion leads to radiative
   cooling in the lower stratosphere in the Arctic and Antarctic. In Arctic
   summer there is weak wave driving, and the radiative cooling due to
   ozone depletion is the dominant driver of observed trends. In late
   winter and early spring, dynamics dominate the changes in Arctic
   temperatures. In austral spring and summer in the Antarctic, strong
   dynamical warming throughout the mid-to lower stratosphere acts to
   weaken the strong radiative cooling associated with the Antarctic ozone
   hole and is indicative of a strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson
   circulation. This dynamical warming is a significant term in the thermal
   budget overmuch of the Antarctic summer stratosphere, including in
   regions where strong radiative cooling due to ozone depletion can still
   lead to net cooling despite dynamical terms. Quantifying the
   contributions of changes in radiation and dynamics to stratospheric
   temperature trends is important for understanding how anthropogenic
   forcings have affected the historical trends and necessary for
   projecting the future.},

Abstract = {The waters of Kuwait Bay, northern Arabian Gulf, are well mixed by
   macrotidal, semi-diurnal tides. Sea surface temperature (SST) is thus a
   good proxy of water mass temperature in the bay. The factors governing
   SST have been conveniently sub-divided into global, regional and local
   drivers. This paper provides a study on long-term drivers of temperature
   change in the northern Arabian Gulf: that is, factors that influence
   decadal changes. AVHRR (NOAA) satellite data of Kuwait Bay, collected
   between 1985 and 2002, show that SST has steadily increased at a rate of
   0.6 (+/- 0.3)A degrees C/decade. This trend was three times greater than
   the concurrent global average. The rate of change was greatest in May
   and June and least during winter months. The trends defined by satellite
   data were substantiated by routine in situ monthly measurements of SST
   made in the region and were also similar to air temperature trends
   recorded at Kuwait airport. The monthly measurements of SST also showed
   a peak in summer temperature coincident with an El Nino event in 1998. A
   relatively low summertime peak during 1991 in the aftermath of Iraqi
   invasion of Kuwait is considered to be the result of atmospheric dimming
   brought about by dense smoke that persisted in the region for most of
   that year.},

Abstract = {We analyse annual northern and southern hemisphere temperature data from
   1856 to 1998 using models that contain either stochastic linear trends
   or deterministic non-linear trends. We find that changes in southern
   hemisphere temperatures lead to changes in northern hemisphere
   temperatures, with no evidence of feedback, in both types of model.
   Where the models differ is that the assumption of stochastic linear
   trends leads to a common trend with constant growth throughout the
   sample period, whereas with deterministic non-linear trends there are
   divergent trend growth paths in the two hemispheres after the early part
   of the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Analyses of maximum temperature data from 49 stations in Nepal for the
   period 1971-94 reveal warming trends after 1977 ranging from 0.06
   degrees to 0.12 degrees C yr(-1) in most of the Middle Mountain and
   Himalayan regions, while the Siwalik and Terai (southern plains) regions
   show warming trends less than 0.03 degrees C yr(-1). The subset of
   records (14 stations) extending back to the early 1960s suggests that
   the recent warming trends were preceded by similar widespread cooling
   trends. Distributions of seasonal and annual temperature trends show
   high rates of warming in the high-elevation regions of the country
   (Middle Mountains and Himalaya), while low warming or even cooling
   trends were found in the southern regions. This is attributed to the
   sensitivity of mountainous regions to climate changes. The seasonal
   temperature trends and spatial distribution of temperature trends also
   highlight the influence of monsoon circulation.
   The Kathmandu record, the longest in Nepal (1921-94), shows features
   similar to temperature trends in the Northern Hemisphere, suggesting
   links between regional trends and global scale phenomena. However, the
   magnitudes of trends are much enhanced in the Kathmandu as well as in
   the all-Nepal records. The authors' analyses suggest that contributions
   of urbanization and local land use/cover changes to the all-Nepal record
   are minimal and that the all-Nepal record provides an accurate record of
   temperature variations across the entire region.},

Abstract = {Understanding and quantifying land management impacts on local climate
   is important for distinguishing between the effects of land management
   and large-scale climate forcings. This study for the first time
   explicitly considers the radiative forcing resulting from realistic land
   management and offers new insights into the local land surface response
   to land management. Regression-based trend analysis is applied to
   observations and present-day ensemble simulations with the Community
   Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2.2 to assess the impact of
   irrigation and conservation agriculture (CA) on warming trends using an
   approach that is less sensitive to temperature extremes. At the regional
   scale, an irrigation- and CA-induced acceleration of the annual mean
   near-surface air temperature (T-2m) warming trends and the annual
   maximum daytime temperature (TXx) warming trends were evident.
   Estimation of the impact of irrigation and CA on the spatial average of
   the warming trends indicated that irrigation and CA have a pulse cooling
   effect on T-2m and TXx, after which the warming trends increase at a
   greater rate than the control simulations. This differed at the local
   (subgrid) scale under irrigation where surface temperature cooling and
   the dampening of warming trends were both evident. As the local surface
   warming trends, in contrast to regional trends, do not account for
   atmospheric (water vapour) feedbacks, their dampening confirms the
   importance of atmospheric feedbacks (water vapour forcing) in explaining
   the enhanced regional trends. At the land surface, the positive
   radiative forcing signal arising from enhanced atmospheric water vapour
   is too weak to offset the local cooling from the irrigation-induced
   increase in the evaporative fraction. Our results underline that
   agricultural management has complex and non-negligible impacts on the
   local climate and highlight the need to evaluate the representation of
   land management in global climate models using climate models of higher
   resolution.},

Abstract = {The HadCRUT4 time series of 166 annual values of global average
   temperature was analysed both deterministically and stochastically and
   the results compared. The deterministic model comprised the sum of a
   linear trend and a multi-decadal oscillation fitted by ordinary least
   squares regression. The stochastic model was an ARMA(1,2) model with a
   drift term included. The deterministic model showed a linear trend of
   0.5 degrees C per century while the stochastic model showed no
   significant drift. In both cases, the residuals were tested for
   self-correlation using standard statistical tests. The residuals from
   the deterministic model were significantly self-correlated whereas those
   from the stochastic model were not. We conclude that the stochastic
   model was a much better fit to the data and that the apparent linear
   trend of the deterministic model was spurious and a consequence of
   performing a regression in which time was the explanatory variable.},

Pages = {565-U291},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Most present-generation climate models simulate an increase in
   global-mean surface temperature (GMST) since 1998, whereas observations
   suggest a warming hiatus. It is unclear to what extent this mismatch is
   caused by incorrect model forcing, by incorrect model response to
   forcing or by random factors. Here we analyse simulations and
   observations of GMST from 1900 to 2012, and show that the distribution
   of simulated 15-year trends shows no systematic bias against the
   observations. Using a multiple regression approach that is physically
   motivated by surface energy balance, we isolate the impact of radiative
   forcing, climate feedback and ocean heat uptake on GMST-with the
   regression residual interpreted as internal variability-and assess all
   possible 15- and 62-year trends. The differences between simulated and
   observed trends are dominated by random internal variability over the
   shorter timescale and by variations in the radiative forcings used to
   drive models over the longer timescale. For either trend length, spread
   in simulated climate feedback leaves no traceable imprint on GMST trends
   or, consequently, on the difference between simulations and
   observations. The claim that climate models systematically overestimate
   the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas
   concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.},

Abstract = {We consider monthly temperature data collected over a period of 16 years
   at 24 stations in the estuarine wetlands of the Elkhorn Slough
   watershed, located in the Monterey Bay area in Central California, USA.
   Our goal is to develop a statistical model in order to separate the
   seasonal cycle, short-term fluctuations, and long-term trends, while
   accounting for the spatial variability of these features. In the model,
   each station has a specific, time-invariant mixture of two seasonal
   patterns, to encompass the spatial variability of oceanic influence.
   Likewise, trends are modeled as local mixtures of two patterns, to
   include the spatial variability of long-term temperature change.
   Finally, all stations share a common baseline, whose temporal
   variability is linearly dependent on a variable that summarizes several
   atmospheric measurements. We use a Bayesian approach with a purposely
   developed Markov chain Monte Carlo method to explore the posterior
   distribution of the parameters. We find that the seasonal cycles have
   changed in time, that neighboring stations can have substantially
   different behaviors, and that most stations show significant warming
   trends.},

Abstract = {The national meteorological institutes in the Nordic countries have
   produced a comprehensive dataset of climatic extreme temperatures
   (monthly mean daily maximum and minimum, and monthly absolute highest
   and lowest temperatures) comprising stations from Fenno-Scandia, the
   Nordic Seas, and Greenland. Mean maximum and minimum temperatures show
   statistically significant negative trends in western coastal Greenland
   during the period 1950-95, while over the Nordic Seas and Fenno-Scandia
   the trends are generally positive. The diurnal temperature range (DTR)
   is decreasing significantly throughout the study area and is unrelated
   to regional temperature trends, which show both warming and cooling. The
   opposite temperature trends between western coastal Greenland and
   Fenno-Scandia since the 1950s are in accordance with a strengthening of
   the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, the simple NAO index
   fails to explain the decrease of DTR. In Fenno-Scandia, the reliable
   long-term mean maximum and minimum temperatures show cooling in winter
   and warming in spring and summer during the period 1910-95.
   Simultaneously, DTR has been decreasing in all seasons except winter.
   Most of the decrease has occurred since the 1940s. Atmospheric
   circulation indices defined by zonal and meridional sea level pressure
   differences, along with sea level pressure and cloud cover anomalies
   were used to build a multiple linear regression model for the
   Fenno-Scandian DTR. During the period 1910-95 the model explains from
   53\% (winter) to 80\% (summer) of the variation in DTR and reproduces
   the statistically significant decreasing trend on annual level. Cloud
   cover is the dominant predictor, while circulation provides substantial
   improvement in explanation.},

Title = {Temperature carbon dioxide partial pressure trends in confined aquifers},
Journal = {CHEMICAL GEOLOGY},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {145},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {73-89},
Month = {MAR 6},
Abstract = {More than 500 published data of partial pressure of CO2 (P-CO2) were
   collected for aqueous solutions from about 30 confined aquifers. The
   selection was limited to cases with no gas phase. Hence, with a
   temperature range for the data from 10 degrees C to 300 degrees C, the
   corresponding hydrostatic pressure is greater than a few bars to 100
   bar, respectively. The data of P-CO2 plotted as a function of
   temperature are clearly grouped into two exponential curves. The lower
   curve corresponds to a pure magmatic rock environment. The P-CO2 varies
   from 10(-6) to 50 bar when the temperature increases from 10 degrees C
   to 300 degrees C. The higher curve corresponds to a sedimentary
   environment. The P-CO2 varies from 2 10(-3) to 130 bar when the
   temperature increases from 10 degrees C to 200 degrees C. Such trends of
   P-CO2 can be computed thermodynamically. The chemical species CO2 can be
   expressed as a relation including solely minerals (m(j)) and their
   stoichiometric coefficient (alpha(j)):
   CO2 double left right arrow (j) Sigma alpha(j)m(j)
   If a solution is at equilibrium with respect to these minerals, the
   P-CO2 value equals the product of their solubility products:
   P-CO2 = (j) Pi K-j(alpha j)/K-CO2
   This expression of P-CO2 depends on temperature (mainly) and pressure
   (weakly) and is independent of any other solution characteristic such as
   chloride content. The seventeen sets of minerals tested can be divided
   into two generic sets:
   \{calcite, Ca-Al-silicate, additional silicates\}
   \{calcite, dolomite, Mg-Al-silicate, other silicates\}The ones including
   only one carbonate, calcite, fit the lower P-CO2 data from magmatic
   rocks. The ones including two carbonates, calcite and dolomite, fit the
   higher P-CO2 data from magmatic rocks. Although carbon in solution might
   have several origins (deep magmatic flux, decomposition of organic
   matter and dissolution of carbonate minerals), the P-CO2 data are equal
   to the ones that would be buffered by the equilibrium of the solution
   with respect to a set of minerals. These results are of interest for the
   use of chemical geothermometers and for studies of changes in sediment
   porosity by diagenesis over geologic times. When modelling chemical
   evolution of a solution in a geologic formation, it is useful to test
   simulations including, among the chemical constraints, equilibrium with
   respect to some j minerals allowing the P-CO2 value to be buffered. (C)

Journal = {GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {99},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This study evaluates recent spatiotemporal variability and trends in
   rainfall and temperature in the central highlands of Ethiopia by using
   monthly rainfall and temperature records. The monthly rainfall data are
   for 132 points of 10x10km grids reconstructed from weather stations and
   meteorological satellite observations, which cover the period between
   1983 and 2013. The monthly maximum and minimum temperatures are for the
   same points and girds, but cover the period 1981-2011. Linear regression
   is used to each of the 132 grid points to detect changes or trends in
   rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures and the statistical
   significance of the trends is determined by the F-distribution test.
   These points were reclassified into the three districts (Woredas in
   Amharic) studied having different agroecologies by extraction techniques
   with ArcGIS 10.1 and converted into raster to generate surface data
   using simple krigging interpolation technique. Annual and June-September
   (Kiremt) rainfall exhibit statistically insignificant increasing trends
   in most of the grid points while March-May (Belg) rainfall shows
   significant decreasing trends. On the other hand, significant
   spatiotemporal variability in the maximum and minimum temperatures is
   observed across the study area. The warming trends in the maximum and
   minimum temperatures for Basona Werana and Efratana Gidim, respectively,
   are statistically significant at p=.05 and p=.01 levels. It is concluded
   that trends of rainfall and temperature vary considerably within the
   study area. This indicates the need for local-level analysis, and
   context-specific planning and implementation of climate change
   adaptation interventions.},

Abstract = {Temperature is one of the most significant elements in climate and
   weather forecasting. There was an increase in the earth's surface (land
   and ocean) temperature by 0.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C during 1901-2000 (NOAA,
   Global Climate Report 2017). In evaluating the effects of climate
   change, the spatiotemporal variability of temperature was examined in
   the Chhattisgarh State, India, using monthly data at 16 stations over
   the period 1901-2016 with a length of 116 years. The standard normal
   homogeneity test was used to evaluate the homogeneity of temperature
   data. Linear regression analysis and four altered versions of the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) method were utilized to analyze the existence of
   trends in temperature series. These four versions of the MK tests
   include the conventional Mann-Kendall method (MK1), the removed
   influence of noteworthy lag-1 autocorrelation (MK2), the removed
   influence of all noteworthy autocorrelation coefficients (MK3) and the
   considered Hurst coefficient (MK4). The results of both parametric and
   non-parametric tests indicated an increase in the annual and seasonal
   temperature in the Chhattisgarh State over the period 1901-2016. The
   most likely change year in the state was 1950. There was a decreasing
   trend at some stations during the period 1901-1950, which reversed in
   the following period 1951-2016. Overall, annual and seasonal temperature
   time series showed increasing trends in all stations over the course of
   the long-term period. Our results confirmed a fact that the agriculture
   crop production has been decreased due to climate change.},

Number = {9},
Pages = {4609-4616},

Abstract = {The projected recovery of ozone from the effects of ozone depleting
   substances this century will modulate the stratospheric cooling due to
   CO2, thereby affecting the detection and attribution of stratospheric
   temperature trends. Here the impact of future ozone changes on
   stratospheric temperatures is quantified for three representative
   concentration pathways (RCPs) using simulations from the Fifth Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). For models with interactive
   chemistry, ozone trends offset similar to 50\% of the global annual mean
   upper stratospheric cooling due to CO2 for RCP4.5 and 20\% for RCP8.5
   between 2006-2015 and 2090-2099. For RCP2.6, ozone trends cause a net
   warming of the upper and lower stratosphere. The misspecification of
   ozone trends for RCP2.6/RCP4.5 in models that used the International
   Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC)/Stratosphere-troposphere Processes
   and their Role in Climate (SPARC) Ozone Database causes anomalous
   warming (cooling) of the upper (lower) stratosphere compared to
   chemistry-climate models. The dependence of ozone chemistry on
   greenhouse gas concentrations should therefore be better represented in
   CMIP6.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {31},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {Observations suggest that the earth's surface has been warming relative
   to the troposphere for the last 25 years; this is not only difficult to
   explain but also contrary to the results of climate models. We provide
   new evidence that the disparity is real. Introducing an additional data
   set, R2 2-meter temperatures, a diagnostic variable related to
   tropospheric temperature profiles, we find trends derived from it to be
   in close agreement with satellite measurements of tropospheric
   temperature. This suggests that the disparity likely is a result of
   near-surface processes. We find that the disparity does not occur
   uniformly across the globe, but is primarily confined to tropical
   regions which are primarily oceanic. Since the ocean measurements are
   sea surface temperatures, we suggest that the disparity is probably
   associated with processes at the ocean-atmosphere interface. Our study
   thus makes unlikely some of the explanations advanced to account for the
   disparity; it also demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between
   land, sea and air measurements.},

Abstract = {The cooling of the Northern Hemisphere since 1940 had been variously
   interpreted as the overture to the next Ice Age, the effect of
   industrial pollution in the atmosphere or of a decline in the solar
   output. Are we in a position to judge between these various
   interpretations and to make a prediction for the next few decades? The
   link with the next Ice Age may be dismissed as a confusion of time
   scales; the explanation in terms of atmospheric pollution merits careful
   examination but seems unlikely to be adequate on its own. Natural
   fluctuations must also be considered. {[}Some predictions or

Title = {Assessing Variability and Trends of Rainfall and Temperature for the
   District of Musanze in Rwanda},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Variability in rainfall and temperature results in different impacts on
   agricultural practices. Assessesment of variability and trend of
   rainfall and temperature for the district of Musanze in Rwanda was
   conducted using six meteorological stations for a period of 37 years,
   ranging from 1981 to 2018, and data were obtained from Rwanda
   Meteorology Agency. Musanze district is located in highland areas of
   Rwanda, understanding the variability and trend in rainfall and
   temperature is paramount to increase the uptake of climate information
   and support strategic orientation. The Mann-Kendall nonparametric test
   and modified Mann-Kendall were used to assess the trend in rainfall and
   temperature, whereas Sen's slope estimator was used to assess the
   magnitude of change. The results from both methods showed much
   similarity and consistency. The assessment of variability and trend in
   rainfall and temperature in Musanza district indicated that increasing
   temperature and decreasing rainfall trends gave an indication of changes
   in variability and trend in rainfall and temperature. The annual pattern
   revealed a substantial downward tendency of -25.7\% for Nyange, the only
   station with constant decreasing trend over all seasons, DJF, -61.4\%,
   SON, -12.2\%, JJA, -40.3\%, and MAM, -4.35. Temperature analysis for
   both maximum and minimum indicated increasing trend which was signal for
   constant warming up in the area. The results from coefficient of
   variation indicated a high disparity in rainfall variation from June to
   August which ranged between 51 and 74\%, and other seasons changes were
   moderate.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {The ocean plays an essential role in regulating global and regional
   climate, which is mainly achieved through sea surface temperature
   anomaly (SSTA) changes. Studies on global sea surface temperature (GSST)
   are primarily carried out under linear assumption, which is not capable
   of fully revealing the evolution characteristics of sea surface
   temperature (SST) due to the non-linear and non-stationary nature of the
   SST. Here, the evolution of the GSST trend in the past century is
   investigated by using an adaptive and local spatial-temporally
   multidimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition method. The
   results show that the global ocean has been warming except for the
   subpolar North Atlantic, the equatorial central Pacific, and the
   Southern Ocean in the Pacific sector. The equatorial central Pacific
   turned from cooling to warming around the middle of the last century
   made it one of the fastest-warming regions in recent decades with other
   regions located in the Arctic Ocean and the western-boundary current
   regions and their mid-latitude extensions in both hemispheres. The
   strongest warming during recent decades is found in the Arctic Ocean,
   east of the continents in the northern hemisphere, the entire Indian
   Ocean, and especially in the tropical Pacific Ocean. From a zonal
   average perspective, warming (>0.1 K since 1900) first took place in the
   subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere and 50 degrees S of the
   Southern Hemisphere almost simultaneously around 1910, then followed by
   the subpolar warming in the Northern Hemisphere. The first two bands of
   warming both expanded equatorward leading to the fast warming of
   tropical oceans, especially for the Pacific Ocean.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the analysis of time trends for European average
   temperature anomalies for the period from 1655 to 2017 using a dataset
   based on the Central England Temperatures (CET) and other meteorological
   stations. The reason for this study is to determine first if long memory
   is present in the data, and then to estimate the time trends in a more
   rigorous way. The results indicate that the series display long memory
   behavior. Based on this and using recursive methods, we show that the
   time trend becomes statistically significant when the data from 2010
   onwards is incorporated, indicating the importance of the last few years
   in the evidence for warming. It should be noted, however, that this last
   result may be a consequence of the statistical method employed and
   should, therefore, be treated with caution.},

Abstract = {Trends and periodicity analyses can provide information on climate
   variability inherent in a particular variable. In this study, trend
   tests and spectral analysis are used to examine the existence of trends
   and cycles in temperature series (1901-2000) of Nigeria. Periods
   1901-1929 and 1942-1980 exhibited cooling trends while 1930-1941 and
   1981-2000 showed warming trends. The warmest years in Nigeria were 1941,
   1935, 1931 and 1987. The coldest years were 1929, 1975, 1925 and 1974.
   Whereas no significant trends were detected for 1901-1930 period, the
   standard period 1931-1960 was marked by significant cooling while
   1961-1990 was marked with significant warming. Annual temperature has
   risen by 0.03 A degrees C/decade during the last century. The overall
   warming was mostly confined to the south of 12A degrees N especially
   during April and June. Changes in minimum temperature are higher than
   that of maximum temperature. The quasi-biennial oscillation was found in
   annual data for all the six zones with periods of about 2-4 years.
   Nigeria landscape is under strong North Atlantic Oscillation influence
   in dry season and under ENSO influence during wet season. Annual
   temperature series was also found to exhibit significant negative
   correlation with SOI.},

Abstract = {In this note, changes in temperature extremes over a 40-yr period are
   analyzed, based on daily minimum and maximum temperatures over
   Argentina. Trend analysis was performed on seasonal means, standard
   deviations, and extremes (5th and 95th percentiles) over the 1959-98
   period. The strongest ( positive) changes over time occurred in mean
   summer minimum temperature, whereas the standard deviation decreased.
   Mean maximum temperatures mostly decrease over time in summer over
   northern Argentina, but they increase in Patagonia ( southern
   Argentina). Generally, negative trends were obtained in the number of
   cold nights and warm days per summer, while the number of warm nights
   and cold days has increased at certain locations. Patagonia shows many
   stations with an increasing number of warm days and nights in winter and
   a decreasing number of cold days and nights in summer. The summer mean
   temperature is more sensitive to extremes than the winter one. In
   summer, the increase in mean temperature is more strongly related to the
   increase in the number of warm days and nights than to a decrease in the
   number of cold days and nights. In winter, the region with the highest
   correlation was found in Patagonia, while in the most productive area
   (La Pampa, Argentina), very little or nonsignificant association exists
   between mean temperature and the occurrence of warm or cold days.},

Abstract = {Controversy remains over a discrepancy between modeled and observed
   tropical upper tropospheric temperature trends. This discrepancy is
   reassessed using simulations from the Coupled Climate Model
   Inter-comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP 5) together with radiosonde and
   surface observations that provide multiple realizations of possible
   observed temperatures given various methods of homogenizing the data.
   Over the 1979-2008 period, tropical temperature trends are not
   consistent with observations throughout the depth of the troposphere,
   and this primarily stems from a poor simulation of the surface
   temperature trends. This discrepancy is substantially reduced when (1)
   atmosphere-only simulations are examined or (2) the trends are
   considered as an amplification of the surface temperature trend with
   height. Using these approaches, it is shown that within observational
   uncertainty, the 5-95 percentile range of temperature trends from both
   coupled-ocean and atmosphere-only models are consistent with the
   analyzed observations at all but the upper most tropospheric level (150
   hPa), and models with ultra-high horizontal resolution ( 0.5 degrees x
   0.5 degrees) perform particularly well. Other than model resolution, it
   is hypothesized that this remaining discrepancy could be due to a poor
   representation of stratospheric ozone or remaining observational
   uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Climatological annual and seasonal dewpoint, specific humidity, and
   relative humidity maps for the United States are presented using hourly
   data from 188 first-order weather stations for the period 1961-90.
   Separate climatologies were calculated for daytime (three observations
   per day between 0800 and 1600 LST), nighttime (three observations per
   day between 2000 and 0400 LST), and the full day (eight observations per
   day, every 3 h).
   With extended datasets for the period 1961-95, trends in these same
   variables and temperature are calculated for each of 170 stations and
   for eight regions of the country. The data show increases in specific
   humidity of several percent per decade, and increases in dewpoint of
   several tenths of a degree per decade, over most of the country in
   winter, spring, and summer. Nighttime humidity trends are larger than
   daytime trends. The specific humidity increases are consistent with
   upward temperature trends. The upward temperature and humidity trends
   are also consistent with upward trends in apparent temperature, a
   measure of human comfort based on temperature and humidity. Relative
   humidity trends are weaker than the specific humidity trends, but they
   do show evidence of increases, especially in winter and spring.
   The possibility that the detected trends may be artifacts of changes in
   instrumentation was examined, but several lines of reasoning suggest
   that they are not. Anthropogenic water vapor produced from fossil fuel
   consumption, both locally and globally, is too small a source to explain
   the observed trends.},

Title = {Trends in intraseasonal temperature variability in Europe, 1961-2018},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {14},
Pages = {7298-7320},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {While long-term changes in measures of central tendency of climate
   elements, that is, mean temperature, are well acknowledged, studies of
   trends in measures of their variability are much less common. This is
   despite the fact that trends in variability can have higher effect on
   climate extremes than trends in mean. Here, four measures of
   intraseasonal variability are examined: (a) standard deviation of mean
   daily temperature, (b) the range between the 90th and 10th quantile of
   mean daily temperature, (c) mean absolute value of day-to-day
   temperature change, and (d) one-day lagged temporal autocorrelation.
   ECA\&D daily data from 168 stations and linear regression method are
   utilized to calculate trends of these characteristics in period from
   1961 to 2018. Significant trends (positive and negative) are revealed
   with substantial differences between seasons, regions and measures. The
   most considerable decreases in temperature variability were recorded in
   winter, for temporal autocorrelation in eastern Europe and for
   variance-based measures in northern Europe. For example, the standard
   deviation has decreased by more than 10\% in the Arctic Ocean. This can
   indicate a decrease in the frequency of cold extremes in Scandinavia. On
   the contrary, increasing persistence may suggest a greater likelihood of
   cold extremes in the East European Plain. Increases in variability
   prevail only in summer, but not for all measures and not as clearly as
   decreases in winter. Trends in temporal autocorrelation and day-to-day
   change appear to be sensitive to data issues, such as inhomogeneities
   and changes in observational procedures.},

Abstract = {We assess the most probable causes of late twentieth century (1960-1994)
   tropospheric temperature changes. Optimal detection techniques are used
   to compare observed spatio-temporal patterns of near-surface and
   tropospheric temperature change with results from experiments performed
   with two different versions of the Hadley Centre climate model. We
   detect anthropogenic forcings, particularly well-mixed greenhouse-gases,
   with a less certain sulfate aerosol cooling influence. More limited
   evidence exists for a detectable volcanic influence. Our principal
   results do not depend upon the choice of model. Both models, but
   particularly HadCM3, appear to overestimate the simulated climate
   response to greenhouse gases (especially at the surface) and volcanoes.
   This result may arise, at least in part, due to errors in the forcings
   (especially sulfate) and technical details of our approach, which
   differs from previous studies. We use corrected and uncorrected versions
   of the radiosonde record to assess sensitivity of our detection results
   to observational uncertainties. We find that previous corrections
   applied to the radiosonde temperature record are likely to have been
   sub-optimal in only taking into account temporal consistency. However,
   the choice of corrected or uncorrected version has no systematic effect
   upon our main conclusions. We show that both models are potentially
   internally consistent explanations of observed tropospheric
   temperatures.},

Abstract = {Temperature trends in the three years following the volcanic eruptions
   of Agung, El Chichon and Pinatubo are studied, employing monthly mean
   temperature data from four meteorological stations of the Meteorological
   Poligon of Camaguey (PMC). A descendent tendency was found for monthly
   mean temperature following those eruptions. In general the trends in the
   three years following the eruptions are different, at a significative
   level of 99.5\%, from the trends of the entire data periods, revealing
   the cooling effects of those eruptions. Also in the Agung and El Chichon
   case the trends were significatively different at a 90\% level, from the
   null trends. Different cooling effects between Pinatubo eruption and
   Agung and El Chichon eruptions are explained by the particularities of
   the movement of the stratospheric aerosols plume of the first,
   occasioned by the different epochs of the year in which Pinatubo erupted
   respect to Agung and El Chichon. The evaluation of the temperature
   anomalies registered in the PMC in the year following the eruptions show
   a most intense cooling than in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole,
   reinforcing the hypothesis of the particular acentuate response of the
   PMC and probably for an island as Cuba to the shadowing of solar
   radiation by stratospheric aerosols, as result of its particular thermal
   insulation occasioned by the notable difference between the thermal
   capacities of the land and sea.},

   showed a non-significant trend. The annual mean maximum temperature,
   warm days, diurnal temperature range and a monthly minimum of maximum
   temperature had decreased significantly by 0.029 \& DEG;C, 0.159 days,
   0.032 \& DEG;C and 0.122 \& DEG;C/yr respectively, whereas cool days and
   cold spell duration had increased significantly by 0.264 \& DEG;C and
   0.372 days/yr respectively, indicating an increased cooling effect over
   the study area. Similarly, out of the 11 rainfall indices, only two
   showed a significant trend, while the remaining showed a nonsignificant
   trend. The increasing drought over the study area is evident as the
   number of rainy days and consecutive wet days have decreased
   significantly by 0.262 days and 0.058 days/yr respectively, with a
   non-significant increase in consecutive dry days during the same period.
   The weak negative non-significant trend of a maximum of five consecutive
   days of rainfall, very heavy rainfall days and total annual
   precipitation indicate the decreasing trend of floods. This study
   stresses the development of adaptation plans to overcome the adverse
   consequences of extreme weather events in Varanasi district.},

Abstract = {The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) provides hindcasts and
   real-time predictions for monthly mean climate fields at lead times of
   up to a year. These global climate model outputs can be useful in
   constructing improved seasonal forecasts. Here, several simple methods
   are developed and evaluated for forecasting monthly temperatures up to a
   year in advance based on either unweighted or weighted NMME outputs, and
   compared to previously developed statistical forecast methods that use
   only time series of past observations. It is found that the NMME-based
   methods produce forecast temperature probability distributions that are
   appropriately shifted toward the warm end of past experience and also
   show skill at representing interannual variability. NMME-based methods
   clearly outperformed purely statistical methods for forecasting
   temperatures over ocean, though over land this improvement is less clear
   over the evaluation period tested. The NMME seasonal forecasts may be
   particularly useful for giving early warning of heat waves, given their
   societal significance and higher conditional skill under those
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Regional changes in California surface temperatures over the last 80
   years are analyzed using station data from the US Historical Climate
   Network and the National Weather Service Cooperative Network.
   Statistical analyses using annual and seasonal temperature data over the
   last 80 years show distinctly different spatial and temporal patterns in
   trends of maximum temperature (Tmax) compared to trends of minimum
   temperature (Tmin). For trends computed between 1918 and 2006, the rate
   of warming in Tmin is greater than that of Tmax. Trends computed since
   1970 show an amplified warming rate compared to trends computed from
   1918, and the rate of warming is comparable between Tmin and Tmax. This
   is especially true in the southern deserts, where warming trends during
   spring (March-May) are exceptionally large. While observations show
   coherent statewide positive trends in Tmin, trends in Tmax vary on finer
   spatial and temporal scales. Accompanying the observed statewide warming
   from 1970 to 2006, regional cooling trends in Tmax are observed during
   winter and summer. These signatures of regional temperature change
   suggest that a collection of different forcing mechanisms or feedback
   processes must be present to produce these responses.},

Abstract = {Within the area of climate change, summer temperatures are of special
   interest because of the economic, social and environmental consequences
   that can derive from their hypothetical increase. A number of recent
   studies have shown a worldwide trend towards increasing summer
   temperatures. In this work, we analyse summer temperatures (July and
   August) in the Valencia region of Spain from 1958 to the present, with
   the aim of characterising their evolution and detecting any trend
   towards a higher frequency of warmer days. First results indicate that
   in our study area there is indeed a higher frequency of days with
   tropical characteristics and persistent heat; in contrast, we found no
   tendency to exceed the records of absolute maximum temperatures.

Abstract = {Climate change is a matured area and it is of current social and
   economic concern. It has drawn political attention due to recent global
   efforts to curb its damaging effect. Due to increased availability of
   geographical data, the knowledge discovery from datasets is critical for
   climate change science and its impacts. This research work discusses the
   prospects of analysing climate change w.r.t recorded trends in abiotic
   factors such as land surface temperature using data mining. A region
   based study on India has been conducted in order to compute and analyse
   the recorded trends against proposition of ``human influence climate
   change{''} advocated especially for developing economy. The approach
   used here is graphing and clustering techniques such as K-means. The
   experimental results show the demographics professing the ground reality

Abstract = {A series of in-situ temperature measurements performed by falling
   spheres at high latitudes in the last similar to 10 years is compared
   with historical temperature data collected by the rocket grenade
   technique in the mid 1960s. Concentrating on summer (here from mid May
   to mid August) and on altitudes between 50 and 85 km, where natural
   variability and instrumental uncertainties are small, the observed trend
   is very small, if present at all. Taking into account all data from 50
   to 85 km the mean trend is -0.024 K/y with a statistical error of
   +/-0.014 K/y, i.e., practically zero. The mean deviation of the grenade
   temperatures from the falling sphere data is 0.8+/-6.4 K and the
   differences are randomly distributed. We have also analyzed various
   subsets of the entire data set, e.g., in a restricted altitude range
   where lidars have shown large trends at mid latitudes, namely from 55 to
   75 km. The main result remains unchanged. The deviation between `old'
   and `new' data is practically zero and the temperature trend in the high
   latitude summer mesosphere is certainly much smaller (if any at all)
   compared to that observed at mid latitudes.},

Abstract = {New homogeneous time series of daily standard phase-height (SPH) and
   daily plasma scale-height (PSH) have been derived from a 50-year
   long-radio-wave measurement of the broadcasting station Allouis (France,
   162 kHz). The signal was received at Kiihlungsbom (54 degrees N, 12
   degrees E, Mecklenburg, Germany) and the present series is a third
   release. The daily time series of SPH shows in its spectrum dominant
   modes which are typical for the solar cycle (SC), for El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) and for quasi-biannual oscillation (QBO), indicating
   solar and lower atmospheric influences. Surprisingly, the time series of
   daily PSH shows a band of dominant cycles larger than 16 years.
   In order to exclude the influence of the winter anomaly in the
   determination of column-integrated mesospheric temperature trends the
   phase-height-temperature procedure is confined to summer months.
   The derived thickness temperature of the mesosphere decreased
   statistically significant over the period 1959-2008 after pre-whitening
   with summer mean of solar sun spot numbers. The trend value is in the
   order of about-1.05 K/decade if the stratopause trend is excluded. The
   linear regression is more pronounced, -1.35 K/decade for the period of
   1963-1985 (2 SCs), but weaker, -0.51 K/decade during 1986-2008 (last 2
   SCs). The linear regression is in very good agreement with a mean
   column-integrated mesospheric trend derived from OHP-Lidar temperatures
   on a monthly mean basis for the last two SCs.
   This clearly shows that the thickness temperature of the mesosphere
   derived from phase-height measurement is a useful proxy for the
   long-term summer temperature change in the mesosphere from 1959 until
   2008.},

Abstract = {The paper analyzes the air temperature characteristics in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina in order to identify recent trends in mean air temperature.
   Trends in annual, seasonal and monthly mean air temperatures during
   1961-2015 periods were determined based on data from sixteen
   meteorological stations. MAKESENS procedure (Salmi, et al., 2002), which
   uses the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and the nonparametric Sen's
   method, was applied on time series of annual, seasonal and monthly mean
   air temperatures to assess the trend magnitude and its statistical
   significance. Given the results, the warming trend is present all over
   Bosnia and Herzegovina. Significant positive trends in annual and summer
   temperatures were detected over the entire territory (p<0.01). Positive
   winter and spring trends are largely significant (p<0.01 or p<0.05),
   whereas autumn trends are low and insignificant. The highest increase
   was registered in June-August and December-January periods. In some
   areas, a low negative trend was present in September and November. A
   significant positive correlation between East-Atlantic pattern index and
   temperature was determined over the entire territory of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina throughout the year. Winter and spring temperatures were
   also significantly related to the North Atlantic Oscillation index and
   Arctic Oscillation index, respectively.},

Abstract = {The progress in the research and development of high temperature sodium
   batteries suggests that all-solid-state batteries with inorganic or
   polymer solid electrolytes are promising power sources for a wide range
   of applications due to their high thermal stability, reliability,
   long-cycle life and versatile geometries. The electrolytes play a
   fundamental role in terms of current (power) density, the time
   stability, and the safety of batteries and, as a result, their
   continuous improvement and innovation are indeed critical to success. In
   fact, inorganic solid electrolytes pave the way for improving the
   cost-effective development of rechargeable sodium batteries. This review
   describes a state-of-the-art overview of most of the Na+ conductors for
   use as electrolytes in sodium/sulphur and ZEBRA batteries. The emphasis
   of this article is on inorganic solid electrolytes, especially, ceramic
   and glass-ceramic electrolytes as promising alternatives applicable to
   all solid-state batteries. As part of a continuous effort to find new
   materials that operate at room temperature and moderate temperatures,
   NASICON electrolytes will also be considered. Polymer electrolytes based
   on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) are also very suitable for all solid-state
   batteries. Hence, the review focuses on ion transport based on the
   observed conductivity, electrolyte preparation, safety and environmental
   impact.},

Abstract = {The Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) from similar to 17 to 14 million
   years ago (Ma) represents an enigmatic reversal in Cenozoic cooling. A
   synthesis of marine paleotemperature records shows that the MCO was a
   local maximum in global sea surface temperature superimposed on a period
   from at least 19 Ma to 10 Ma, during which global temperatures were on
   the order of 10 degrees C warmer than at present. Our high-resolution
   global reconstruction of ocean crustal production, a proxy for tectonic
   degassing of carbon, suggests that crustal production rates were similar
   to 35\% higher than modern rates until similar to 14 Ma, when production
   began to decline steeply along with global temperatures. The magnitude
   and timing of the inferred changes in tectonic degassing can account for
   the majority of long-term ice sheet and global temperature evolution
   since 20 Ma.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {139},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {1305-1316},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Temperature trends differ markedly not only region-to-region and between
   seasons but also depending on the selected dataset. Only a few studies
   have attempted to compare temperature trends between data sources of
   different types. Here, one station-based (ECA\&D), two gridded (E-OBS;
   CRUTEM) and two reanalysis (ERA-40; NCEP/NCAR) datasets are used for
   long-term temperature change detection over Europe. The period from 1957
   to 2002 when all the datasets overlap is examined and the linear
   regression method is utilized to calculate temperature trends in each
   season separately. Raster maps illustrating differences in trends
   between datasets are accompanied by mean temperature series showing the
   causes of these discrepancies. We demonstrate that trends in reanalyses
   deviate considerably from the other datasets mainly because the type and
   amount of data assimilated into them change in time. Interestingly,
   whilst the ERA-40 shows lower trends due to an overestimation of the
   mean temperature prior 1967, the NCEP/NCAR reveal lower trends compared
   with other datasets owing to mean temperature underestimation at the end
   of the examined period. A noticeable anomaly in NCEP/NCAR data was
   detected in Eastern Europe in summer with temperature trends nearly
   twice as steep compared with other data sources. The study also reveals
   the weaknesses of gridded datasets, such as the unstable number of
   stations entering the interpolation over time. The lack of
   representativeness of some climate stations is the major drawback of the
   station data.},

Title = {Long-term trends in daily temperature extremes in Iraq},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {198},
Pages = {97-107},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The existence of long-term persistence (LTP) in hydro-climatic time
   series can lead to considerable change in significance of trends.
   Therefore, past findings of climatic trend studies that did not consider
   LTP became a disputable issue. A study has been conducted to assess the
   trends in temperature and temperature extremes in Iraq in recent years
   (1965-2015) using both ordinary Mann-Kendal (MK) test; and the modified
   Mann-Kendall (m-MK) test, which can differentiate the multi-decadal
   oscillatory variations from secular trends. Trends in annual and
   seasonal minimum and maximum temperatures, diurnal temperature range
   (DTR), and 14 temperature -related extremes were assessed. MK test
   detected the significant increases in minimum and maximum temperature at
   all stations, where m-MK test detected at 86\% and 80\% of all stations,
   respectively. The temperature in Iraq is increasing 2 to 7 times faster
   than global temperature rise. The minimum temperature is increasing more
   (0.48-1.17 C/decade) than maximum temperature (0.25-1.01 C/decade).
   Temperature rise is higher in northern Iraq and in summer. The hot
   extremes particularly warm nights are increasing all over Iraq at a rate
   of 2.92-10.69 days/decade, respectively. On the other hand, numbers of
   cold days are decreasing at some stations at a rate of 2.65 to 8.40
   days/decade. The use of m-MK test along with MK test confirms the
   significant increase in temperature and some of the temperature extremes
   in Iraq. This study suggests that trends in many temperature extremes in
   the region estimated in previous studies using MK test may be due to
   natural variability of climate, which empathizes the need for validation
   of the trends by considering LTP in time series.},

Abstract = {Tropical atmospheric temperatures in different tropospheric layers are
   retrieved using satellite-borne Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU)
   observations. We find that tropospheric temperature trends in the
   tropics are greater than the surface warming and increase with height.
   Our analysis indicates that the near-zero trend from Spencer and
   Christy's MSU channel-2 angular scanning retrieval for the tropical
   low-middle troposphere (T-2LT) is inconsistent with tropical
   tropospheric warming derived from their MSU T-2 and T-4 data. We show
   that the T-2LT trend bias can be largely attributed to the periods when
   the satellites had large local equator crossing time drifts that cause
   large changes in calibration target temperatures and large diurnal
   drifts.},

Abstract = {Three realizations of the atmospheric temperature representing the layer
   from the surface to about 18 km generated from microwave emissions were
   published in 2003. Their 1979 - 2002 linear trends were stated as + 0.24
   +/- 0.02, + 0.12 +/- 0.02 and + 0.03 +/- 0.05 degreesC decade(-1).
   Because the upper portion of this layer includes the stratosphere, the
   opportunity to utilize radiosonde measurements as an independent
   assessor of these trend values is diminished. However, the University of
   Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) also produces a lower tropospheric
   temperature ( LT) product (0 - 8 km, trend of + 0.08 degreesC
   decade(-1)) for which radiosondes are much more suitable. Comparisons of
   this UAH product with radiosonde-simulated layer temperatures show no
   significant difference in LT trends, lending support for the least
   positive trend of the three deeper layer values (+ 0.03 +/- 0.05
   degreesC decade(-1)) as it was constructed in the same manner as LT.},

Abstract = {Strong and thick temperature inversions are key components of the Arctic
   climate system and it is important to study and better understand them.
   The present study quantifies the temporal and spatial variability of
   surface-based inversions (SBIs) and elevated inversions (EIs) over
   Greenland, as derived from the ERA-Interim (ERA-I) dataset for the
   period 1979-2017. The seasonal and multiannual variability of inversion
   strength, thickness, and frequency are examined. Our results clearly
   show regional as well as seasonal patterns of both SBIs and EIs. SBIs
   are more frequent and stronger than EIs, and the spatial variability of
   inversions is larger during winter and smaller during summer.
   Furthermore, during summer, there has been a trend toward stronger (0.3
   K decade(-1)), thicker (12m decade(-1)), andmore frequent (3\%
   decade(-1)) SBIs in the southern part of Greenland, especially in the
   past two decades. Evidently, the strengthening of the anticyclone over
   Greenland causes a reduction of cloud cover, which manifests in an
   increase in SBI strength and thickness, particularly in the southern
   part of Greenland.},

Title = {Impacts of Atmospheric Temperature Trends on Tropical Cyclone Activity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {26},

Pages = {3877-3891},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Impacts of tropical temperature changes in the upper troposphere (UT)
   and the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) on tropical cyclone (TC)
   activity are explored. UT and lower TTL cooling both lead to an overall
   increase in potential intensity (PI), while temperature changes at 70
   hPa and higher have negligible effect. Idealized experiments with a
   high-resolution global model show that lower temperatures in the UT are
   associated with increases in global and North Atlantic TC frequency, but
   modeled TC frequency changes are not significantly affected by TTL
   temperature changes nor do they scale directly with PI.
   Future projections of hurricane activity have been made with models that
   simulate the recent upward Atlantic TC trends while assuming or
   simulating very different tropical temperature trends. Recent Atlantic
   TC trends have been simulated by (i) high-resolution global models with
   nearly moist-adiabatic warming profiles and (ii) regional TC downscaling
   systems that impose the very strong UT and TTL trends of the NCEP-NCAR
   reanalysis, an outlier among observational estimates. The impact of
   these differences in temperature trends on TC activity is comparable to
   observed TC changes, affecting assessments of the connection between
   hurricanes and climate. Therefore, understanding the character of and
   mechanisms behind changes in UT and TTL temperature is important to
   understanding past and projecting future TC activity changes. The UT and
   TTL temperature trends in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis are unlikely to be
   accurate and likely drive spuriously positive TC and PI trends and an
   inflated connection between absolute surface temperature warming and TC
   activity increases.},

Abstract = {Long-term variability in global sea surface temperature (SST) is often
   quantified by the slope from a linear regression fit. Attention is then
   focused on assessing the statistical significance of the derived slope
   parameter, but the adequacy of the linear model itself, and the inherent
   assumption of a deterministic linear trend, is seldom tested. Here, a
   parametric statistical test is applied to test the hypothesis of a
   linear deterministic trend in global sea surface temperature. The
   results show that a linear slope is not adequate for describing the
   long-term variability of sea surface temperature over most of the
   earth's surface. This does not mean that sea surface temperature is not
   increasing, rather that the increase should not be characterized by the
   slope from a linear fit. Therefore, describing the long-term variability
   of sea surface temperature by implicitly assuming a deterministic linear
   trend can give misleading results, particularly in terms of uncertainty,
   since the actual increase could be considerably larger than the one
   predicted by a deterministic linear model.},

Abstract = {Maximum and minimum surface air temperatures (T-max, T-min) throughout
   Mexico were analysed to look for a regional sign of climate change.
   Temperature (T) records were divided into two periods: early (1940-1969)
   and recent (1970-2004): and the analysis was performed for the four
   seasons plus the annual average. For these 20 cases, and for each of
   similar to 1400 selected stations, time series were Constructed and
   their linear trends (m) were obtained. The statistical significance of m
   was tested by posing the null hypothesis m = 0, i.e. that there was no
   trend. The length of the time series (n) considered for this test was
   the n-effective (n(eff)) that takes into account the fact that
   consecutive values of T have non-zero correlation. The null hypothesis
   was rejected in less than 25\% of the stations in all cases. The
   principal findings are: (1) Mexico warmed up during the recent period,
   and this warming was more generalized in T-max than in T-min and in
   summer than in the other seasons: (2) Mexico cooled down during the
   early period, and this cooling was more generalized in winter than in
   the other seasons (3) In neither of these two cases El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) seems to play any direct role, (4) In contrast to
   ENSO, the trends and phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are
   consequent in both cases: a warming trend at the beginning of the 1970s
   and a warm PDO phase prevailing during the recent warming period; as
   well as a cooling trend at the beginning, of the 1940s and a cold PDO
   phase prevailing during the early cooling period and (5) north-western
   and central Mexico temperature trends often contrast with those of the
   rest of the country. Copyright (C) 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 16},
Abstract = {Most climate models suggest amplification of global warming in high
   mountains, but observations are less clear. Using comprehensive,
   homogeneity-adjusted temperature records from over 1000 high elevation
   stations across the globe, we examine the causes of changing temperature
   trends with elevation, assessing the roles of free atmospheric change,
   topography (exposure and aspect), and cryospheric feedback. The data
   show that observed 20th century temperature trends are most rapid near
   the annual 0 degrees C isotherm due to snow-ice feedback. Mountain
   summit and freely draining slope sites are dominated by free-air
   advection and thus have consistent trend magnitudes, with reduced
   inter-site variance in comparison with incised valley sites where local
   factors are more important. Thus, while there has been no simplistic
   elevational increase in warming rates, some generalizations can be made.
   Water resources and ecosystems near the 0 degrees C isotherm in the
   extratropics are at increased risk from accelerated warming. The data
   also suggest that exposed mountain summits, away from the effects of
   urbanization and topographic sheltering, may provide a relatively
   unbiased record of the planet's climate.},

Title = {Recent variability and trends of Antarctic near-surface temperature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Number = {D4},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {A new monthly 1 degrees x 1 degrees Antarctic near-surface temperature
   reconstruction for 1960-2005 is presented. The use of numerical model
   fields to establish spatial relationships between fifteen continuous
   observational temperature records and the voids to which they are
   interpolated inherently accounts for the effects of the atmospheric
   circulation and topography on temperature variability. Employing a fixed
   observation network ensures that the reconstruction uncertainty remains
   constant in time. Comparison with independent observations indicates
   that the reconstruction and two other gridded observational temperature
   records are useful for evaluating regional near-surface temperature
   variability and trends throughout Antarctica. The reconstruction has
   especially good skill at reproducing temperature trends during the
   warmest months when melt contributes to ice sheet mass loss. The spatial
   variability of monthly near-surface temperature trends is strongly
   dependent on the season and time period analyzed. Statistically
   insignificant (p > 0.05) positive trends occur over most regions and
   months during 1960-2005. By contrast, 1970-2005 trends are weakly
   negative overall, consistent with positive trends in the Southern
   Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) during summer and autumn. Subtle
   near-surface temperature increases during winter from 1970 to 2000 are
   consistent with tropospheric warming from radiosonde records and a lack
   of winter SAM trends. Widespread but statistically insignificant (p >
   0.05) warming over Antarctica from 1992 to 2005 coincides with a
   leveling off of upward SAM trends during summer and autumn since the
   mid-1990s. Weakly significant annual trends (p < 0.10) of about +1 K
   decade(-1) are found at three stations in interior and coastal East
   Antarctica since 1992. The subtle shift toward warming during the past
   15 years raises the question of whether the recent trends are linked
   more closely to anthropogenic influences or multidecadal variability.},

Title = {ABUNDANCES OF STARS WITH PLANETS: TRENDS WITH CONDENSATION TEMPERATURE},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {732},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Precise abundances of 18 elements have been derived for 10 stars known
   to host giant planets from high signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution
   echelle spectroscopy. Internal uncertainties in the derived abundances
   are typically less than or similar to 0.05 dex. The stars in our sample
   have all been previously shown to have abundances that correlate with
   the condensation temperature (T-c) of the elements in the sense of
   increasing abundances with increasing T-c; these trends have been
   interpreted as evidence that the stars may have accreted H-depleted
   planetary material. Our newly derived abundances also correlate
   positively with T-c, although slopes of linear least-square fits to the
   {[}m/H]-T-c relations for all but two stars are smaller here than in
   previous studies. When considering the refractory elements (T-c > 900 K)
   only, which may be more sensitive to planet formation processes, the
   sample can be separated into a group with positive slopes (four stars)
   and a group with flat or negative slopes (six stars). The four stars
   with positive slopes have very close-in giant planets (three at 0.05 AU)
   and slopes that fall above the general Galactic chemical evolution
   trend. We suggest that these stars have accreted refractory-rich planet
   material but not to the extent that would increase significantly the
   overall stellar metallicity. The flat or negative slopes of the
   remaining six stars are consistent with recent suggestions of a planet
   formation signature, although we show that the trends may be the result
   of Galactic chemical evolution.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {21},
Number = {18},
Pages = {4749-4765},

Abstract = {Long-term trends in the heat content of the Southern Hemisphere ocean
   are evaluated by comparing temperature profiles collected during the
   1990s with profiles collected starting in the 1930s. Data are drawn both
   from ship-based hydrographic surveys and from autonomous floats. Results
   show that the upper 1000 m of the Southern Hemisphere ocean has warmed
   substantially during this time period at all depths. Warming is
   concentrated within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). On a global
   scale, this warming trend implies that the ocean has gained heat from
   the atmosphere over the last 50 to 70 years. Although the data do not
   preclude the possibility that the Southern Ocean has warmed as a result
   of increased heat fluxes, either into the ocean or within the ocean, in
   general the strong trend in the Southern Ocean appears regionally
   consistent with a poleward migration of the ACC, possibly driven by
   long-term poleward shifts in the winds of the region, as represented by
   the southern annular mode.},

   system (QUARC). Independent satellite records from the Microwave
   Sounding Unit (MSU) record are Used to validate breakpoints over the
   satellite era.
   Differences in the treatment of metadata and the strictness of the
   Statistical breakpoint detection Methods used lead to relatively poor
   agreement in breakpoint identification. Agreement ill long-term
   (1958-2003) trends in the homogenized data was found to result from a
   fortuitous cancellation of large differences in the pre- and
   post-satellite era trends between the two approaches.
   A consideration of independent MSU satellite data lends some credence to
   the presence and calculated magnitude of many of the assigned
   breakpoints that were not associated with recorded metadata events. in
   the later part of the record. However, it also highlights that neither
   of the approaches is likely to be perfect at identifying breaks.
   Improved metadata are likely to prove vital in confirming the presence
   of these breaks and hence the veracity of the various homogenization
   approaches to data Cor eastern China. Copyright (C) 2007 Royal

Abstract = {The interannual and decadal variability and trends of summer (June to
   August) air temperature over the Oltenia Plain area is analysed for the
   period 1961 to 2010. The datasets cover monthly temperatures from six
   meteorological stations. Linear regression and the non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test are used to discover any trends present in the
   datasets. As expected, the most significant trends found for temperature
   mark increases of up to 0.5 degrees C. From the temporal variations, a
   dramatic increase in temperature is observed particularly in the last
   two decades. This enhancement of average temperature is strongly
   consistent with the results of present studies made in Europe, warming
   being mainly attributed to an increase in anthropogenic greenhouse
   gases. From the spatial distribution viewpoint, most stations behave
   quite similarly, indicating that the increasing trends are more likely
   linked to large-scale rather than local processes. The analysis of
   temperature during distinct seasons is quite important as different
   seasonal warming rates may have important consequences for natural
   vegetation, agriculture, human health, and energy consumption, amongst
   others.},

Abstract = {Analyses are conducted to assess whether simulated trends in SST and
   land surface air temperature from two versions of a coupled
   ocean-atmosphere model are consistent with the geographical distribution
   of observed trends over the period 1949-1997. The simulated trends are
   derived from model experiments with both constant and time-varying
   radiative forcing. The models analyzed are low-resolution (R15, similar
   to 4 degrees) and medium-resolution (R30, similar to 2 degrees) versions
   of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled climate
   model. Internal climate variability is estimated from long control
   integrations of the models with no change of external forcing. The
   radiatively forced trends are based on ensembles of integrations using
   estimated past concentrations of greenhouse gases and direct effects of
   anthropogenic sulfate aerosols (G+S). For the regional assessment, the
   observed trends at each grid point with adequate temporal coverage
   during 1949-1997 are first compared with the R15 and R30 model unforced
   internal variability Nearly 50\% of the analyzed areas have observed
   warming trends exceeding the 95th percentile of trends from the control
   simulations. These results suggest that regional warming trends over
   much of the globe during 1949-1997 are very unlikely to have occurred
   due to internal climate variability alone and suggest a role for a
   sustained positive thermal forcing such as increasing greenhouse gases.
   The observed trends are then compared with the trend distributions
   obtained by combining the ensemble mean G+S forced trends with the
   internal variability ``trend{''} distributions from the control runs.
   Better agreement is found between the ensemble mean G+S trends and the
   observed trends than between the model internal variability alone and
   the observed trends. However, the G+S trends are still significantly
   different from the observed trends over about 30\% of the areas
   analyzed. Reasons for these regional inconsistencies between the
   simulated and the observed trends include possible deficiencies in (1)
   specified radiative forcings, (2) simulated responses to specified
   radiative forcings, (3) simulation of internal climate variability, or
   (4) observed temperature records.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing technology to study vegetative canopies by measuring
   optical, thermal, and microwave signatures provides optimism for
   frequent characterization of plant performance in the field. Ground
   truth data are required in the calibration and the validation of
   satellite data. The objective of this work was to measure canopy
   temperature (CT), canopy photosynthesis (CER), and evapotranspiration
   (ET) of spring wheat (Triticum durum Desf. `'Aldente'') irrigated at two
   levels. A large portable field chamber (volume of 3.25 m(3) and an area
   of 2.67 m(2)) enclosed the canopy, and CO2 and water vapor
   concentrations were measured at 2-s intervals for 60 s with an infrared
   gas analyzer operated in differential mode. Canopy temperature was
   measured with an infrared thermometer (4 degrees FOV; 0.15 m dia spot
   size) mounted on the outside front corner of the chamber aimed 3 m
   directly in front of the chamber and represents the mean of 15
   measurements. Other estimates of CT were obtained from a fixed infrared
   thermometer at the weather station and from low flying aircraft. Diurnal
   measurements were completed on 10 April 1989 when the wheat was in
   midflowering (Zadoks scale 65). Diurnal trends in CER showed differences
   between fully irrigated and deficit-irrigated plots. The small
   differences in ET and CT between irrigated and deficit-irrigated plots
   suggested minimum plant stress on deficit-irrigated plots, at least
   during the early part of the day. The cumulative daytime photosynthesis
   showed the irrigated plots averaged 28.9 g CO2 m(-2) while the
   deficit-irrigated plots showed a 52\% reduction in CER. The CT ranged
   from about 7 degrees C near sunrise through a maximum of 27 degrees C
   and then decreased to 15 degrees C at sundown. The average cumulative
   daytime chamber ET was 8.41 mm and 7.69 mm for the fully and
   deficit-irrigated plots, respectively, which compared with reference ET
   of 8.91 mm and aircraft estimate of 8.93 mm. Diurnal trends in CT and ET
   showed a stronger association and were similar for both irrigated and
   deficit-irrigated plots.},

Abstract = {The change in the mean temperature in Finland is investigated with a
   dynamic linear model in order to define the sign and the magnitude of
   the trend in the temperature time series within the last 166 years. The
   data consists of gridded monthly mean temperatures. The grid has a 10 km
   spatial resolution, and it was created by interpolating a homogenized
   temperature series measured at Finnish weather stations. Seasonal
   variation in the temperature and the autocorrelation structure of the
   time series were taken account in the model. Finnish temperature time
   series exhibits a statistically significant trend, which is consistent
   with human-induced global warming. The mean temperature has risen very
   likely over 2 A degrees C in the years 1847-2013, which amounts to 0.14
   A degrees C/decade. The warming after the late 1960s has been more rapid
   than ever before. The increase in the temperature has been highest in
   November, December and January. Also spring months (March, April, May)
   have warmed more than the annual average, but the change in summer
   months has been less evident. The detected warming exceeds the global
   trend clearly, which matches the postulation that the warming is
   stronger at higher latitudes.},

Abstract = {This work seeks to understand the variability of warm and cool events
   during summer in Turkey. Daily maximum air temperature data from 97
   weather stations were analyzed to determine percentile threshold values
   (99th, 95th, 90th, 1st, 5th, and 10th) at each station. Trends in the
   percentile values were determined using the Mann-Kendall trend test. The
   analysis demonstrates an increase in frequency of warm, hot, and
   extremely hot days, whereas cool, cold, and extremely cold days show a
   decreasing trend. Increasing trends are statistically significant at the
   0.05 and 0.01 levels for 13 and 46\% of the stations, respectively.
   Significant decreasing trends have been detected at 0.05 and 0.01 levels
   for 19 and 15\% of 97 stations, respectively. Analysis of the
   observations shows that the number of warm and hot event started to
   increase in the 1970s. Warm events are comparatively more numerous than
   cold events in western and southern parts of the country.},

Abstract = {Various indices have been used to investigate recent changes in the
   annual frequencies of extreme temperature events in Mongolia. A
   high-quality daily temperature dataset including 53 station records was
   used to determine trends from 1961 to 2010. The Climdex1.0 software was
   used to calculate 11 extreme temperature indices for this study. The
   results showed significant changes in important temperature indices over
   the study period, especially in the Gobi Mongolia. The analysis showed
   that an apparent increase in summer days was observed, while an
   appreciable decrease in frost days was observed. The maximum values of
   daily maximum temperature (TXx) and daily minimum temperature (TNx) and
   the minimum values of T-max (TXn) and T-min (TNn) tended to increase.
   However, for TXx and TNx, this increasing trend was mainly observed in
   the Gobi Mongolia, while for TXn and TNn, this increasing trend was
   observed over the entire country. A significant reduction at a rate of
   -0.6 d decade(-1) (-1.0 d decade(-1)) occurred for cool nights (days),
   and a significant increase at a rate of 2.8 d decade(-1) (3.1 d
   decade(-1)) occurred for warm nights (days). The reduction of cool
   nights and cool days occurred over four seasons, while the increase of
   warm days and warm nights occurred mainly in summer. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {This paper deals with the modelling of the global and northern and
   southern hemispheric anomaly temperature time series using a novel
   technique based on segmented trends and fractional integration. We use a
   procedure that permits us to estimate linear time trends and orders of
   integration at various subsamples, where the periods for the changing
   trends are endogenously determined by the model. Moreover, we use a
   non-parametric approach (Bloomfield P, Biometrika, 60:217-226, 1973) for
   modelling the I(0) deviation term. The results show that the three
   series (global, northern and southern temperatures) can be well
   described in terms of fractional integration with the orders of
   integration around 0.5 in the three cases. The coefficients associated
   to the time trends are statistically significant in all subsamples for
   the three series, especially during the final part of the sample, giving
   then some support to the global warming theories.},

Abstract = {Daily maximum and minimum temperatures from 40 stations in Israel were
   analyzed to detect long-term trends and changes in temporal and spatial
   distribution patterns during the second half of the 20th Century. The
   trend analysis, reveals a rather complex changing pattern, with a
   significant decreasing trend of both the daily maximum and minimum
   temperature, during the cool season, and an increasing trend during the
   warm season.
   The seasonal temperature range exhibits an increasing trend: the summers
   have become warmer while the winters have become colder. The increase of
   the minimum summer temperature is more pronounced than the increase of
   the maximum temperature, while the decrease of the maximum temperature
   in winter is greater than the decrease of the minimum, thus resulting in
   a significant decline of the air temperature diurnal range in both
   seasons.
   It appears that the frequency of occurrence of extreme temperature
   events, with lower winter and higher summer temperatures, has increased.
   On an annual basis, there seems to be almost no temporal trends in
   minimum and maximum temperatures since the changes in winter and summer
   show an opposite tendencey.},

Abstract = {Temporal trends in sulfate, base cation (Ca2+ + Mg2+ + K+), and H+ ion
   concentrations in bulk precipitation and throughfall samples collected
   over a seven year period (1989-95) in four forested catchments in
   Finland are presented. The catchments are in remote locations and span
   the boreal zone (61-69 degrees N). The stands represent old, undisturbed
   forests, and are composed of varying proportions of Scots pine, Norway
   spruce and deciduous species (mainly Betula spp.). Monthly SO42--S and
   H+ ion concentrations in bulk precipitation averaged over the study
   period and catchments were: 18.7 mu mol L-1 and 32.3 mu mol L-1. The
   corresponding values for throughfall were: 37.4 mu mol L-1 and 32.4 mu
   mol L-1. Sulfate and H+ ion concentrations in bulk precipitation and
   throughfall both showed negative linear trends, which were significant
   (p < 0.05) for the three southernmost catchments. Concentrations and
   trend slope decreased northwards (e.g., bulk precipitation SO42--S slope
   estimates: -1.6 to -1.0 mu mol L-1 yr(-1)). The decline was greater for
   throughfall than for bulk precipitation, indicating a proportionally
   greater reduction in dry deposition than wet. The sum of base cation
   concentrations averaged 12.1 mu mol((+)) L-1 in bulk precipitation and
   83.1 mu mol((+)) L-1 in throughfall. There were no significant trends in
   the sum of base cations (p > 0.05). It is concluded that the reported
   reduction in S emissions over the study period has resulted in a
   significant reduction in the acidity and SO42- concentration of bulk
   precipitation, and this reduction has has been reflected in throughfall
   concentrations. The greatest reduction has taken place in the southern
   part of the country.},

Abstract = {A paper in 1991 claimed that regions affected by desertification
   experience warming trends relative to neighbouring areas. To assess
   this, an index of aridity/humidity based on the ratio of annual
   precipitation to annual potential evapotranspiration totals (P/PET) is
   developed. This index is used to define regions experiencing increases
   (and those where the increase is statistically significant) in aridity
   and humidity. We also consider regions always and (average values of
   P/PET < 0.5) and always humid (P/PET > 2.0). Trends of average annual
   and summer surface air temperature are then calculated for regions in
   the various aridity/humidity categories and compared to most of the rest
   of the world's land areas equatorward of 60 degrees. The results
   indicate that most of the differences in trends between categories are
   not statistically significant.},

Title = {Relationship between values and trends of two circulation indices and

Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {427-442},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Extreme values of two circulation indices are examined for the time
   series covering the period 1960-2006. The influence of circulation on
   surface temperature and rainfall in Argentina is analysed using a zonal
   index Z and a meridional index R at the 1000 and 500 hPa levels.
   Seasonal means for all the years representing extreme negative values of
   R(Z) at 1000 and/or 500 hPa, determine mainly positive (negative)
   temperature anomalies with increased rainfall in both indices. These
   characteristics revert for extreme positive values of R(Z). At 1000 hPa,
   seasonal anomaly trends of R are negative and significant. Trends of Z
   are all positive and significant, except for winter when they are not
   significant. Signs of trends at 500 hPa are the same as at 1000 hPa,
   except for Z in winter and R in summer, whose values are not
   significant. Annual and seasonal trends of the anomalies of Z
   differences between 500 and 1000 hPa, are mostly negative, which implies
   a decrease in baroclinicity in southernmost South America. Analysis of
   the statistical values obtained for both variables generated by extreme
   values of R and Z, and of the signs and significance of index trends at
   1000 hPa indicates that both circulation indices might contribute to
   surface temperature warming during the last years of the period
   1960/2006. The increase in R, whose influence is greater than that of Z,
   might contribute to greater rainfall. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal

Title = {Analysis of rainfall and temperature trends and variability in semi-arid
   Tharaka South Subcounty, Kenya},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {13-38},
Abstract = {To better understand the impacts of climate variability, including
   spatiotemporal variations in mean rainfall, temperature, and other
   climatic elements, it is imperative to analyze the dynamics of these
   elements. Despite the high vulnerability of the Tharaka South Subcounty,
   Kenya, to the impacts of climate change and variability, no studies have
   analyzed the local climatic trends and variability to inform response
   strategies. In this study, we analyzed rainfall and temperature trends
   and variability in Tharaka South Subcounty using gridded rainfall and
   temperature data sourced from CHIRPS and CHIRTS. Variability analysis
   employed descriptive statistics, coefficients of variation, standardized
   anomalies, and the precipitation concentration index. Trends were
   analyzed using a Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. The study
   area is characterized by low rainfall that shows a decreasing trend.
   Local rainfall is generally marked by high and increasing variability,
   high and increasing concentration, and a high probability of extreme
   events. The area has also experienced increasingly severe and frequent
   droughts, with most years in the study period having below-average
   rainfall. Rainfall variability is thus characterized by a decrease in
   rainfall, high rainfall concentration, extreme rainfall events, and more
   frequent and severe droughts. Large-scale climate forcings also
   influence the local rainfall trends and variability. In addition, the
   study area has high temperatures that show an increasing trend, and the
   region experiences a fluctuating temperature regime. An increase in
   temperature is associated with a reduction in rainfall amount. Moreover,
   the area is marked by spatial variability of rainfall and temperature,
   both with positive and negative spatial trends. The findings of this
   study will improve understanding of climatic trends and variability,
   leading to a better understanding of their impacts and informing the
   development of effective response strategies in the study area.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the temporal variability and trend of
   temperature and rainfall in Gelana sub-watershed, northern highlands of
   Ethiopia. The study employed a mixed methods approach, but
   overwhelmingly relied on gridded monthly rainfall and maximum and
   minimum temperature data at a resolution of 10 x 10 km. The quantitative
   data were analyzed using standardized rainfall anomaly, precipitation
   concentration index, coefficient of variation and Mann-Kendall (MK)
   trend analysis. The results indicated that rainfall over ``Kiremit{''}
   and ``Belg{''} seasons is found highly variable in the study area. The
   annual total rainfall has shown an increasing trend of 0.05 mm per year.
   The MK test results showed that ``Kiremit{''} rainfall has a positive
   increasing trend, while Belg rainfall showed a statistically significant
   decreasing trend. A warming trend of annual maximum and minimum
   temperature has been observed over the study area. The study suggests
   strategies to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and
   to reduce the likelihood of production risks.},

   temperature and rainfall variations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {In this study, we investigated whether long-term normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) data show climate change signals after the
   mid-1990s which are inferred from other studies on changing trends in
   precipitation and dust frequencies. In doing so, mean NDVI data for the
   growing seasons (April-October) from 1982 to 2006 were used for
   examining the spatiotemporal variations in the vegetation over East
   Asia, in conjunction with precipitation and temperature data. Results
   indicate that there was a prominent change in the trend of NDVI around
   the mid-1990s: a pronounced positive trend over most of the East Asian
   domain before the mid-1990s (1982-1996) and a reverse (or weakened)
   trend after the mid-1990s (1997-2006). The reverse trend is evident over
   the higher-latitude regions north of 50 degrees N and the eastern
   Mongolian border area. The EOF and SVD analysis suggest that the
   dominant warming trend until the mid-1990s led to the increased NDVI
   over the high-latitude regions. However, after the mid-1990s, the
   reverse NDVI trend found primarily in the east of Lake Baikal and the
   arid and semiarid regions south of 50 degrees N seems to be closely
   linked to local precipitation changes occurred abruptly in the
   mid-1990s. However, precipitation influences on the reverse NDVI changes
   are not clear over the high-latitude regions north of 50 degrees N.},

   locations viz. Ambala, Bawal, Hisar, Karnal and Sirsa, in both the

   1989) in Haryana state were analyzed. Calculations were performed using
   the Excel template MAKESENS (Mann-Kendall test for trend and Sen's slope
   estimator). The annual trend and slope values of temperature related
   climate change indicators for five locations in the state of Haryana
   indicated a decrease in the cold extreme event. The hot extreme events
   showed an increasing order. The trend and slope of night extremes (TR20
   and TN90) were more potent than those in day extremes (TNn, TXn,)
   resulting in the decrease of day-night temperature variation as
   demonstrated by constructing diurnal temperature range (DTR) for Bawal,
   Hisar, Karnal and Sirsa.Overall, the results showed widespread
   significant changes in temperature trends consistent with warming,
   especially for those indices derived from daily minimum temperature.
   Annual average trend for DTR in the state was -0.78 degrees C. The trend
   of rainfall indices in Haryana showed an increase in rainfall intensity
   for Bawal however the trends of rainfall indices showed no definite
   trends over different stations.},

Abstract = {Continuous times series \{f (x)\} such as a depth of water is written
   f(x) = T (x)+ P (x)+ S (x) + C (x) in hydrological science where T (x),
   P (x), S (x) and C(x) are called the trend, periodic, stochastic and
   catastrophic components respectively. We simplify this model and apply
   it to the local temperature data such as given E. Halley (1693), the UK
   (1853-2010), Germany (1880-2010), Japan (1876-2010). We also apply the
   model to CO2 data. The model coefficients are evaluated by a symbolic
   computation by using a standard personal computer. The accuracy of
   obtained nonlinear curve is evaluated by the arithmetic mean of relative
   errors between the data and estimations. E. Halley estimated the
   temperature of Gresham College from 11/1692 to 11/1693. The simplified
   model shows that the temperature at the time rather cold compared with
   the recent of London. The UK and Germany data sets show that the maximum
   and minimum temperatures increased slowly from the 1890s to 1940s,
   increased rapidly from the 1940s to 1980s and have been decreasing since
   the 1980s with the exception of a few local stations. The trend of Japan
   is similar to these results.},

   active gases, may dominate the response of the mesosphere to greenhouse
   gas emissions. In support of this an examination of the variability in
   the superposed epoch of OH temperature and radiance showed strong
   impulses near equinox. A simple gravity-wave transmission and
   dissipation model indicates that these are due in part to seasonal
   increases in the gravity-wave transmission of the lower atmosphere, and
   enhanced wave heating and mixing in the mesosphere. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study investigates the long-term trends in precipitation, runoff
   and runoff coefficient in major urban watersheds in the United States.
   The seasonal Mann-Kendall trend test was performed on monthly
   precipitation, runoff and runoff coefficient data from 1950 to 2009
   obtained from 62 urban watersheds covering 21 major urban centers in the
   United States. The results indicate that only five out of 21 urban
   centers in the United States showed an uptrend in precipitation. Twelve
   urban centers showed an uptrend in runoff coefficient. However, six
   urban centers did not show any trend in runoff coefficient, and three
   urban centers showed a significant downtrend. The highest rate of change
   in precipitation, runoff and runoff coefficient was observed in the
   Houston urban watershed. Based on the results obtained, we also
   attributed plausible causes for the trends. Our analysis indicated that
   while a human only influence is observed in most of the urban
   watersheds, a combined climate and human influence is observed in the
   central United States.},

Abstract = {By using Caterpillar-SSA analysis method, through the process of
   embedding, singular value decomposition, grouping and diagonal
   averaging, the seasonal precipitation trend at north Helan Mountain and
   Baiyinaobo regions, Inner Mongolia for the next 20 years is forecasted.
   The results show an increasing precipitation trend from 1992 to 2004. In
   the subsequent decade the precipitation should reduce quickly, and it
   will reach a minimum near 2012 to 2014 in both regions. The drought
   caused by the decrease of the precipitation from May to July in the
   north Helan Mountain area during the period of 2013-2014 is probably
   quite similar to that around 1929. Further, the period of precipitation
   gradual increase follows in the researched regions.},

Abstract = {The average January, July and annual temperatures were examined at 27
   stations located in the Canadian Arctic. Some of these stations have
   temperature records extending as far back as 1895. Nearly all stations
   exhibited warming trends. For each station, the difference between the
   temperatures relative to the average value found during 1961-1990 was
   found. The resulting temperature change averaged over the 27 stations
   was then plotted to give a time series covering the period 1895-2014.
   Trends were found for the January, July and annual temperatures of 3.1,
   1.6 and 1.9 degrees C per century, respectively. Similar trends were
   found in the western and eastern Arctic. The warming occurred primarily
   in the first and last decades of the twentieth century. For the period
   1915-1995, the annual temperature trend was only 0.4 degrees C per
   century.},

   surface and troposphere with each other and with model simulations for
   the past 26 years. The observations at the surface and in the
   troposphere are consistent with climate model simulations. At middle and
   high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, the zonally averaged
   temperature at the surface increased faster than in the troposphere
   while at low latitudes of both hemispheres the temperature increased
   more slowly at the surface than in the troposphere. The resulting global

   0.05 K/ 10 yr, which compares very well with the trend obtained from

Abstract = {New time series of the hemispheric and global mean temperature anomalies
   in the troposphere and lower stratosphere are presented for the period
   May 1958 through December 1989. The statistics are based on objective
   monthly analyses of all available daily soundings from the global
   rawinsonde network (approximately 700-800 stations). The results are
   compared with Angell's earlier statistics based on a subset of 63
   stations. Excellent agreement is found with these earlier results as
   well as with an 11-year set of satellite-derived microwave sounding unit
   data. These detailed comparisons support the conclusion that the
   rawinsonde network can provide reliable estimates of the actual
   interseasonal hemispheric-scale temperature changes that have occurred
   between the earth's surface and about 20 km (50 mb) height since the
   1950s.},

Abstract = {The US Climate Change Science Program {[}CCSP, 2006] reported, and
   Douglass et al. {[}2007] and NIPCC {[}2008] confirmed, a ``potentially
   serious inconsistency{''} between modeled and observed trends in

   {[}2008: hereafter ``Santer{''}], though sharing several co-authors with
   CCSP {[}2006], offered ``new observational estimates of {[}tropical]
   surface and tropospheric temperature trends{''}, concluding that ``there
   is no longer a serious discrepancy between modelled and observed
   trends.{''} Santer's key graph {[}shown here as Fig. 5] misleadingly
   suggests an overlap between observations and modeled trends. His ``new
   observational estimates{''} conflict with satellite data. His modeled
   trends are an artifact, merely reflecting chaotic and structural model
   uncertainties that had been overlooked. Thus the conclusion of
   ``consistency{''} is not supportable and accordingly does not validate
   model-derived projections of dangerous anthropogenic global warming

Title = {Trend detection in the temperature of Quebec (Canada) rivers},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 29},
Abstract = {Trend detection in environmental data subjected to natural fluctuations
   can prove difficult. With river temperature, the difficulty also lies in
   the typically limited lengths of the time series. In this work, three
   different river temperature data sources (continuous and spot instream
   measurements, and satellite thermal images) were combined to build 30-
   to 44-year-long time series at 116 locations, distributed throughout
   most of the Quebec Province territory. Mann-Kendall tests and a
   non-linear model were used to detect and quantify trends. Uncertainty
   and biases due to the different data sources and uneven samplings were
   evaluated and included in the assessment of the trends' quantification
   and reliability. Overall, most trends detected in the temperature of
   Quebec rivers are positive, with higher warming occurring in summer.
   Annual maxima are found to have increased by 0.023 degrees C/year
   (median value) between 1979 and 2022, and this maximum appears to occur
   2.6 days (median value) later.},

Abstract = {Condition monitoring can greatly reduce the maintenance cost for a wind
   turbine. In this paper, a new condition-monitoring method based on the
   nonlinear state estimate technique for a wind turbine generator is
   proposed. The technique is used to construct the normal behavior model
   of the electrical generator temperature. A new and improved memory
   matrix construction method is adopted to achieve better coverage of the
   generator's normal operational space. Generator incipient failure is
   indicated when the residuals between model estimates and the measured
   generator temperature become significant. Moving window averaging is
   used to detect statistically significant changes of the residual mean
   value and standard deviation in an effective manner; when these
   parameters exceed predefined thresholds, an incipient failure is
   flagged. Examples based on data from the Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition system at a wind farm located at Zhangjiakou in northern
   China have been used to validate the approach and examine its
   sensitivity to key factors that influence the performance of the
   approach. It is demonstrated that the technique can identify dangerous
   generator over temperature before damage has occurred that results in
   complete shutdown of the turbine.},

Title = {Temperature trend-altitude relationship in China during 1963-2012},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {122},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Based on daily air temperature data from 745 stations in China, the
   present study investigates the regional characteristics of temperature
   trend and the dependence of temperature changes on the altitude during
   the period of 1963-2012. There is a consistent warming trend throughout
   the country except for the southwest China where a cooling trend is
   identified. Moreover, significant warming trend exists in highland areas
   such as the Northeast, Inner Mongol, and the Tibet region. Compared with
   other seasons, the warming trend is most pronounced in highland regions
   in winter. In summer, the temperature has no obvious increasing trend in
   north China, while the cooling trend is found in south China. The
   relationship between altitude and temperature trend is further
   investigated by dividing China into three subregions according to the
   altitude-below 200, 200-2,000, and above 2,000 m. Although there is no
   simple linear relationship between elevation and warming trend on
   national scale, the temperature trend-altitude relation is different
   among the three regions. The temperature trend decreases with altitude
   below 200 m while increases from 200 to 2,000 m, and a weak positive
   temperature trend-altitude relation is found over 2,000 m. The strongest
   temperature trend-altitude relations are found in the subtropical
   regions, especially pronounced south of 36A degrees N in China. The
   magnitudes of decreases from 200 to 2,000 m are one order lower than the
   increases below 200 m. Low-altitude stations appear to be influenced
   more by anthropogenic aerosols. High-altitude stations are mostly
   located in flat terrain and sparsely populated region. Therefore,
   temperature trends change with elevations.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the analysis of the MET Office Hadley Centre's sea
   surface temperature data set (HadSST3) by using long-range dependence
   techniques. We incorporate linear and segmented trends using fractional
   integration, and thus permitting long memory behavior in the detrended
   series. The results indicate the existence of warming trends in the
   three series examined (Northern and Southern Hemispheres along with
   global temperatures), with orders of integration which are in the range
   (0.5, 1) and thus implying nonstationary long memory and mean reverting
   behavior. This is innovative compared with other works that assume short
   memory behavior in the detrended series. Allowing for segmented trends
   two features are observed: increasing values in the degree of dependence
   of the series across time and significant warming trends from 1940
   onwards.},

Abstract = {One of the most significant signals in the thermometer-observed
   temperature record since 1900 is the decrease in the diurnal temperature
   range over land, largely due to warming of the minimum temperatures.
   While some data sets have indicated this asymmetrical warming has been
   reduced since 1979, regional analyses (e.g. East Africa) indicate that
   the nocturnal warming continues at a pace greater than daytime
   temperatures. The cause for this night time warming in the observed
   temperatures has been attributed to a variety of causes. Climate models
   have in general not replicated the change in diurnal temperature range
   well. Here we would like to try to distinguish between warming in the
   nocturnal boundary layer due to a redistribution of heat and warming due
   to the accumulation of heat. The temperature at night at shelter height
   is a result of competition between thermal stability and mechanical
   shear. If stability wins then turbulence is suppressed and the cooling
   surface becomes cut-off from the warmer air aloft, which leads to sharp
   decay in surface air temperature. If shear wins, then turbulence is
   maintained and warmer air from aloft is continually mixed to the
   surface, which leads to significantly lower cooling rates and warmer
   temperatures. This warming occurs due to a redistribution of heat. As
   will be shown by techniques of nonlinear analysis the winner of the
   stability and shear contest can be very sensitive to changes in
   greenhouse gas forcing, surface roughness, cloudiness, and surface heat
   capacity (including soil moisture). Further, the minimum temperatures
   measured in the nocturnal boundary layer represent only a very shallow
   layer of the atmosphere which is usually only a few hundred meters
   thick. It is likely that the observed warming in minimum temperature,
   whether caused by additional greenhouse forcing or land use changes or
   other land surface dynamics, is reflecting a redistribution of heat by
   turbulence not an accumulation of heat. Because minimum temperatures in
   the stable boundary layer are not very robust measures of the heat
   content in the deep atmosphere and climate models do not predict minimum
   temperatures well, minimum temperatures should not be used as a
   surrogate for measures of deep atmosphere global warming.},

   forcings. An annually and globally averaged radiative forcing of -0.13
   +/- 0.02 W m(-2) decade(-1) (-0.22 +/- 0.03 W m(-2) for the 1979-1996
   period) was found from SBUV total column ozone trends, applying a
   constant percentage ozone depletion to a 7 km thick layer directly above
   the tropopause SAGE ozone trends gave forcing estimates of -0.10 +/-
   0.02 W m(-2) decade(-1) (-0.17 +/- 0.03 W m for the 1979-1996 period),
   although assumptions needed to be made about the choice of the vertical
   profile of the ozone depletion below 17 km. Using Dobson instrument
   trends from 1964 to 1996, the total ozone forcing could be as negative
   as -0.26 +/- 0.05 W m(-2). The quoted error bars derive from
   uncertainties in the total ozone trends. Using these values, the
   stratospheric ozone change may have offset about 30\% of the forcing due
   to increases in well-mixed greenhouse gases since 1979, and about 15\%
   of the forcing since 1964, at least on a global and annual mean. The
   ozone forcings are shown to be nearly a linear function of the ozone
   amount depleted from the atmospheric column, provided the vertical
   profile of the depletion remains constant. As in previous studies, it
   was found that stratospheric adjustment altered the sign of the ozone
   forcing by strongly cooling the lower stratosphere. It is shown that
   (depending on the vertical structure of ozone depletion) coolings of up
   to 0.4 K decade(-1) can be found at altitudes of 35 km; this provides a
   mechanism for cooling the stratosphere nearly as large as that from
   well-mixed greenhouse gas increases, at altitudes where ozone changes
   were previously thought not to strongly affect stratospheric temperature
   trends. Previous studies have examined the effect of ozone trends by
   looking at the response of the surface temperature to a fixed absolute
   ozone change at different heights in the atmosphere. We argue that using
   absolute ozone perturbations places an unrealistically large emphasis on
   ozone changes near the tropopause. As the vertical profile of ozone
   change is more often reported as a percentage change, we present the
   sensitivity of the surface temperature to constant percentage, rather
   than absolute, changes in ozone.},

Abstract = {The persistent occurrence of extreme precipitation events presents
   considerable challenges to the well-being, assets, and sustainable
   progress of the population in China. During this century, the trends,
   change points, and spatial variability of population exposure to
   precipitation extremes remain unclear. This study assesses how the
   exposure changes in future decades, using climate predictions from CMIP6
   models and population projections under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5
   scenarios. We identify the initial decade and duration when exposure
   exceeds dangerous level, and also reveal the movements of the
   geographical centroids in different regions. It is found that under the
   SSP5-8.5 scenario, both precipitation extremes and population exposure
   to these extremes would be more severe, in contrast to the SSP2-4.5
   scenario. Under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, 47.88\% of the study area is
   projected to experience dangerously high levels of population exposure
   to precipitation extremes compared to the baseline. Under the SSP5-8.5
   scenario, the areas experiencing dangerous exposure levels would
   increase by 4.11\% by the 2030s, with 18.76\% of areas experiencing
   earlier occurrences. In the North China Plain, the geographic centroid
   of population exposure is expected to move toward southward. These
   findings aid governmental authorities in identifying crucial timeframes,
   devising effective response strategies, and adjusting spatial disaster
   reduction resource allocation plans.},

Abstract = {Under the background of climate change, the tendency, mutability and
   periodicity of the annual precipitation of 47 meteorological stations in
   Haihe River Basin (HRB) and the surrounding area and their annual
   relative humidity were analyzed, by various statistical methods,
   including moving average method, Mann-Kendall test, Yamamoto diagnose,
   Maximum Entropy method, and Wavelet analysis. Also, a research about the
   relationship between precipitation and relative humidity was made with
   the support of SPSS. The results show that: (1) From 1961 to 2010, the
   decreasing trends of the annual precipitation and annual relative
   humidity in HRB are both significant, with a trend of -1.8426 mm/a and
   -0.0607\%/a separately. (2) The mutation years of annual precipitation
   concluded from M-K test and Yamamoto diagnose are similar, both around
   1976. However, the mutation year of the annual relative humidity are
   different with different methods. The M-K method shows the mutation
   occurred in 2002, while the Yamamoto diagnose indicates it happened in
   1976, same as the annual precipitation. (3) The oscillation period of
   the two elements are both around 26 years by Wavelet analysis. But the
   results of Maximum Entropy method contain more than one period; the most
   significant of which is 9 years. (4) The regression analysis shows the
   change of relative humidity has a 2 10-days hysteresis after the
   precipitation.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of precipitation simulated in the
   historical runs of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6
   (CMPI6) in capturing the complex spatial and temporal patterns observed
   over Southwestern South America (SWSA). Precipitation outputs from 14
   general circulation models (GCMs) were compared with observations from
   CRU TS 4.03 database for the period 1901-2014, using a set of
   statistical metrics, with particular focus in the quantification of the
   long-term precipitation decline that triggered recent recurrent drought
   conditions over SWSA. The main features of regional precipitation were
   adequately captured by the majority of CMIP6 models, although with a wet
   bias south of 35 degrees S especially along the Andes ranges and in
   southern Chile, which can exceed 100 mm during the winter rainy season.
   The magnitude of the long-term precipitation decline was reasonably
   captured by the different GCMs, but model outputs tend to locate the
   maximum in precipitation decrease south of the position of the observed
   trends. The precipitation decline can be linked to the observed positive
   long-term trend in SLP over the subtropical southeast Pacific Ocean.
   Nevertheless, only few GCMs were able reproduce the spatial patterns of
   observed SLP trends. Finally, considering a comprehensive rating index,
   we selected a subset of five GCMs that best reproduced the
   climatological features of precipitation and its temporal and spatial
   changes over the study area, with a brief discussion of implications for
   the assessment of future precipitation over SWSA.},

Title = {Twenty-year inter-annual trends and seasonal variations in precipitation

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {171},
Number = {1-4},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mean annual concentration of SO42- in wet-only deposition has decreased
   between 1988 and 2006 at the paired watershed study at Bear Brook
   Watershed in Maine, USA (BBWM) due to substantially decreased emissions
   of SO2. Emissions of NOx have not changed substantially, but deposition
   has declined slightly at BBWM. Base cations, NH4+, and Cl-concentrations
   were largely unchanged, with small irregular changes of < 1 mu eq L-1
   per year from 1988 to 2006. Precipitation chemistry, hydrology,
   vegetation, and temperature drive seasonal stream chemistry. Low flow
   periods were typical in June-October, with relatively greater
   contributions of deeper flow solutions with higher pH; higher
   concentrations of acid-neutralizing capacity, Si, and nonmarine Na; and
   low concentrations of inorganic Al. High flow periods during
   November-May were typically dominated by solutions following shallow
   flow paths, which were characterized by lower pH and higher Al and DOC
   concentrations. Biological activity strongly controlled NO3- and K+.
   They were depressed during the growing season and elevated in the fall.
   Since 1987, East Bear Brook (EB), the reference stream, has been slowly
   responding to reduced but still elevated acid deposition. Calcium and Mg
   have declined fairly steadily and faster than SO42-, with consequent
   acidification (lower pH and higher inorganic Al). Eighteen years of
   experimental treatment with (NH4)(2)SO4 enhanced acidification of West
   Bear Brook's (WB) watershed. Despite the manipulation, NH+4
   concentration remained below detection limits at WB, while leaching of
   NO3- increased. The seasonal pattern for NO-3 concentrations in WB,
   however, remained similar to EB. Mean monthly concentrations of SO42-
   have increased in WB since 1989, initially only during periods of high
   flow, but gradually also during base flow. Increases in mean monthly
   concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ due to the manipulation occurred
   from 1989 until about 1995, during the depletion of base cations in
   shallow flow paths in WB. Progressive depletion of Ca and Mg at greater
   soil depth occurred, causing stream concentrations to decline to
   pre-manipulation values. Mean monthly Si concentrations did not change
   in EB or WB, suggesting that the manipulation had no effect on mineral
   weathering rates. DOC concentrations in both streams did not exhibit
   inter- or intra-annual trends.},

Abstract = {This study examines the factors responsible for the long-term changes of
   winter monsoonal flow around Japan in association with increasing
   precipitation trends in December along the coastal areas of Honshu (the
   main island of Japan) facing the Sea of Japan. The precipitation around
   the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and maritime continent has
   significantly increased in recent years. Thus, a packet of the
   stationary Rossby wave associated with the anomalous heating deflects
   the subtropical jet to the south over the eastern edge of the Eurasian
   continent. The deflection of the jet gives favorable conditions for the
   development of a low pressure trough in the lower level on the eastern
   side, leading to the formation of negative height anomalies near the
   surface around Japan.
   Although tropical precipitation also increases in November and January,
   the anomalous heating induces negative height anomalies and cyclonic
   circulations over the inland region of China and eastern offshore region
   of Japan (to the further west and east in comparison with those in
   December) in these months. As a result, monsoonal flow around Japan (and
   precipitation along the coastal areas of the Sea of Japan) shows no
   long-term trends in November or January.},

   approaches of an extreme value theory: the temporal and spatial
   nonstationarities are handled via a tail trend function in the marginal
   distributions. The spatial dependence structure is modeled by a latent
   spatial process using generalized l-Pareto processes. This methodology
   for trend analysis of extreme events is applied to precipitation data
   from Burkina Faso. We show that a significant increasing trend for the
   50 and 100 year return levels in some parts of the country. We also show
   that extreme precipitation is spatially correlated with distance for a
   radius of approximately 200 km.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal changes of the climatic water balance in Romania as a
   response to precipitation and reference evapotranspiration trends during
   1961-2013},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {172},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Changes in precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET) and, implicitly,
   in the climatic water balance (CWB), are imminent effects of climate
   warming. However, changes in the CWB, as a response to changes in P and
   ET, have not yet been analysed thoroughly enough in many parts of the
   world, including Romania. The present study explores the spatio-temporal
   changes of the CWB (difference between P and reference
   evapotranspiration, ETo) in Romania, based on a wide range of climatic
   data (P, as well as temperature, relative air humidity, sunshine
   duration and wind speed, necessary for computing ETo with the FAO-56
   Penman-Monteith method) recorded at 70 weather stations across the
   country in the 1961-2013 period. As a secondary objective, the study
   attempts to identify the possible connections between the index's trends
   and large-scale atmospheric circulation, assessed based on the dynamics
   of certain European-scale relevant teleconnection indices. Thus, the
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope methods were used to analyse CWB
   trends (but also P and ETo trends, in order to explain CWB pattern
   changes) annually, seasonally and in the maize and wheat growing
   seasons. Also, the Spearman correlation procedure and a composite
   analysis between interannual series of teleconnection indices and CWB
   were used to assess the influence of atmospheric circulation on the
   index's variability for all analysed time scales. The results generally
   showed CWB decreases (for the most part of up to -2 mm/yr, yet with a
   relatively low statistical significance) and highlighted an overall
   amplification of drier conditions on all time scales, except for autumn
   (CWB increases, generally of up to 1 mm/yr, but with low statistical
   significance). Moreover, net changes of even under -200 mm/53 yrs
   annually and -175 mm/53 yrs in summer and for the maize and wheat
   growing seasons were found in the CWB. Spatially, it was found that the
   country's southwestern and southeastern regions are the main epicentres
   of drier trends, while the northwest appears to have become wetter.
   Overall, the negative CWB trends are due to partial P decreases
   (statistically insignificant) and general ETo increases (highly
   statistically significant, even 100\% in summer). It seems that the
   amplification of the climatic water deficit across the country is
   especially linked to the positive phases of the Arctic Oscillation and
   North Atlantic Oscillation, but also, in part, to those of several other
   teleconnection indices that affect Europe. Our results signal the
   necessity to adapt anthropic and ecological systems to future dryness
   trends countrywide, which will most likely intensify against the
   background of climate change expected to occur by the end of the
   century.},

Title = {Temporal trends of bulk precipitation and stream water chemistry
   (1977-1997) in a small forested area, Krusne hory, northern Bohemia,
   Czech Republic},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {13},
Number = {17},
Pages = {2721-2741},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The Krusne hory (Erzgebirge or Ore Mountains) has been: heavily;
   affected by high atmospheric pollutant deposition caused by fossil fuel
   combustion in an adjacent Tertiary coal basin. Long-term routine
   sampling of bulk precipitation (1977-1996) and stream water (1977-1998)
   in a forested area on the south-eastern slope of the mountains were used
   to evaluate trends and patterns in solute concentration and flux with
   respect to controlling processes. From 1977 to 1996, the annual
   volume-weighted Ca2+ and SO42- concentrations decreased in bulk
   precipitation. However, after 1989, when a pronounced and continuous
   decrease occurred in coal production, annual volume-weighted
   concentrations decreased for most solutes, except H+. The concentration
   decreases were marked, with 1996 levels at or below 50\% of those in
   1989. The lack of a trend in H+ is attributed to similar decreases in
   both acid anions and neutralizing base cations. Stream water
   concentrations of most solutes, i.e. H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42- and NO3-,
   were highest at the onset of sampling in 1977, decreased markedly from
   1977 to 1983 and decreased more gradually from 1983 to 1998. The spruce
   forest die-back and removal reduced dry deposition of these solutes by
   reducing the:filtering action, which was provided by the forest canopy.
   A notable decrease in stream water Ca2+ concentrations occurred after
   1995 and may be due to the depletion of Ca2+, which was provided by
   catchment liming in 1986, 1988 and 1989. Solute flux trends in bulk
   atmospheric deposition and stream water generally were not significant
   and the lack of trend is attributed to the large interannual variability
   in precipitation quantity and-runoff, respectively. All solutes except
   Na+ varied seasonally. The average seasonal concentrations varied
   between the solutes, but for most solutes were highest in winter and
   spring and lowest in summer, correlating with the seasonal trend in
   runoff. For Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42-, the concentration minimum occurs in
   September and the maximum occurs in February or March, correlating with
   the seasonal baseflow. These solutes;are primarily controlled by the
   contribution of soil water and groundwater to stream flow. During
   snowmelt, the meltwater generally causes concentrations to decrease as
   soil water and groundwater are diluted. For NO3, average minimum
   concentrations occur in August at the end of the growing season
   concurrent with the lowest stream flow, and the maximum occurs in
   February and March with high stream flow during snowmelt. Seasonal:
   stream water NO3- concentration variations are large compared with the
   long-term decrease. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose the use of the Ensemble Empirical Mode
   Decomposition (EEMD) method in the analysis of trends in climate data.
   As compared to existing traditional methods, EEMD is simple, fast and
   reliable. It works by decomposing the time-series data into intrinsic
   mode functions until a residual component is obtained which represents
   the trend in the data. The dataset considered consists of satellite
   precipitation estimates (SPE) obtained from the Tropical Rainfall
   Measuring Mission (TRMM) for the tropical South-West Indian Ocean (SWIG)
   basin recorded during the periods January 1998 to December 2013. The
   SWIO basin spans from the latitudes 5 degrees S to 35 degrees S and the
   longitudes 30 degrees E to 70 degrees E and comprises of part of the
   east coast of Africa and some small island developing states (SIDS) such
   as Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Reunion Island. The EEMD analysis
   is carried out for summer, winter and yearly time series of the SPE
   data. The results from the study are presented in terms of intrinsic
   mode functions (IMFs) and the trends. The analysis reveals that in
   summer, there is a tendency to have an increase in the amount of
   rainfall, whereas in winter, from 1998 to 2004 there has been an initial
   increase of 0.0022 mm/hr/year and from there onwards till 2013 a
   decrease of 0.00052 mm/hr/year was noted.},

Abstract = {Flood is the most destructive disaster which causes loss of human life
   and the economy. Recently Tamil Nadu has been facing floods frequently.
   Chennai and Cuddalore districts were affected heavily by the 2015 flood.
   Cuddalore district comes under the lower vellar basin. This research
   aims to determine the change in land use land cover and rainfall trend
   of the lower vellar basin and its impact on flood. The Land use land
   cover map was prepared for the lower vellar basin for a temporal
   variation of 5 years for 2005, 2010, and 2015 using remote sensing data
   (Landsat images) and software (Arc GIS and ERDAS). The settlement has
   increased, and barren Land has reduced. However, there is no significant
   change in Waterbodies, forests, littoral swamps and plantations. Daily
   precipitation data of 30 years are collected, and trend analysis is done
   using Mann-Kendall (MK) method. Out of the 11 rain gauge stations, 4
   stations show a positive precipitation trend. The settlement in 2015 was
   nearly 2\% only in the total area, showing a sustainable land use
   development. Compared to precipitation, land use and land cover change
   has minimum effect on the flood.},

Title = {PWV Inversion Model Based on Random Forest and the Trend of Its

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In the context of anomalous global climate change and the frequent
   occurrence of droughts and floods, studying trends in the conversion
   rate between precipitable water vapor (PWV) and actual precipitation in
   a certain region can help in analyzing the causes of these natural
   disasters. This paper examines the variation trend in the conversion
   rate between PWV and actual precipitation on a monthly scale in Hubei
   from 1960 to 2020. To estimate historical PWV data, we propose a new
   method for estimating PWV using water vapor pressure based on the RF
   algorithm. The new method was evaluated by radiosonde data and improved
   the accuracy by 1 mm over the traditional method in Hubei. Based on this
   method, we extrapolate the monthly average PWV in Hubei from 1960 to
   2020 and analyze the conversion rate between PWV and precipitation
   during this period. Our results showed that there was no obvious
   cyclical pattern in the conversion rate in either the longitude or
   latitude directions. In Hubei, where the topography varies significantly
   in the longitude direction, the conversion rate is influenced by
   topography, with the smallest conversion rate being in the transition
   zone between the mountainous region of western Hubei and the Jianghan
   Plain. In the latitudinal direction, the conversion rate decreases with
   increasing latitude.},

Abstract = {Precipitation durations and intensities over the period 1950-2008 are
   analysed using daily rain gauge data from the Deutsche Wetterdienst
   raingauge network-one of the densest and most properly maintained
   precipitation observational networks in Europe. Truncated geometric
   distribution of the family of discrete distributions was applied for
   quantifying probability distribution of the durations of wet spells.
   Further intensities of wet spells of different durations were analysed
   along with wet spell lengths. During the cold season (October-March) wet
   periods over the whole of Germany demonstrate a robust pattern of
   lengthening by about 2-3\% for the mean durations of wet spells and up
   to 6\% for extremely long wet periods. This tendency is clearly
   associated with growing (up to 10\% per decade in Eastern Germany)
   intensity of precipitation during long wet periods (more than 5 days)
   and the weakening of precipitation events associated with short and
   moderately long wet periods with both signals being statistically
   significant. Trends are superimposed with interdecadal variability,
   which is the strongest in Northern and Central Germany. In the warm
   season (April-September) there is no robust pan-German trend pattern in
   the wet spell durations and associated precipitation intensities. Strong
   structural changes in winter precipitation over Germany potentially
   imply growing rates of winter ground water recharge over Germany and
   increasing probability of winter flash and river flooding.},

Abstract = {Climate extreme events have been observed more frequently since the
   1970s throughout Ethiopia, which adversely affects the socio-economic
   development of the country, as its economy depends on agriculture,
   which, in turn, relies heavily on annual and seasonal rainfall. Climate
   extremes studies conducted in Ethiopia are mainly limited to a specific
   location or watershed, making it difficult to have insights at the
   national level. The present study thus aims to examine the observed
   climate extreme events in Ethiopia at both station and agro-ecological
   zone (AEZ) levels. Daily rainfall and temperature data for 47 and 37
   stations, respectively (1986 up to 2020), were obtained from the
   National Meteorology Agency (NMA). The Modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) trend
   test and the Theil-Sen slope estimator were employed to estimate the
   trends in rainfall and temperature extremes. This study examines trends
   of 13 temperature and 10 rainfall extreme indices using RClimDex in R
   software. The results revealed that most of the extreme rainfall indices
   showed a positive trend in the majority of the climate stations. For
   example, an increase in consecutive dry days (CDD), very heavy rainfall
   days (R20), number of heavy rainfall days (R10) and consecutive wet days
   (CWD) were exhibited in most climate stations. In relation to AEZs, the
   greater number of extreme rainfall indices illustrated an upward trend
   in cool and sub-humid, cool and humid, and cool and moist AEZs, a
   declining trend in hot arid AEZ, and equal proportions of increasing and
   decreasing trends in warm semi-arid AEZs. Concerning extreme temperature
   indices, the result indicated an increasing trend of warm temperature
   extreme indices and a downward trend of cold temperature extreme indices
   in most of the climate stations, indicating the overall warming and
   dryness trends in the country. With reference to AEZs, an overall
   warming was exhibited in all AEZs, except in the hot arid AEZ. The
   observed trends in the rainfall and temperature extremes will have
   tremendous direct and indirect impacts on agriculture, water resources,
   health, and other sectors in the country. Therefore, the findings
   suggest the need for identifying and developing climate change
   adaptation strategies to minimize the ill effects of these extreme
   climate events on the social, economic, and developmental sectors.},

Abstract = {Changes in atmospheric CO2, ocean temperature, and regional vegetation
   conditions in Mesoamerica indicate that significant trends in
   temperature and rainfall may have occurred in the Sierra Madre de
   Chiapas, Mex-ico. This is an important region for flora and fauna which
   could be affected by climate trends. We aimed to determine if and where
   climate trends had occurred in the Sierra Madre and lower elevation
   regions between 1990 and 2016 (27 years), if these trends were part of
   longer term (1960-2016 {[}57 years]) changes, and how changes in
   large-scale and regional/local conditions may be influencing these
   trends. In the Sierra Madre, overall minimum daily temperatures
   increased, maximum temperatures decreased, and the most significant mean
   temperature trends were cooler during the 27-yr period. Both the start
   and end of the wet season trended earlier in the year, and wet season
   rainfall increased significantly. Trends were not significant during the
   57-yr period in the Sierra Madre; however, in the adjacent Pacific coast
   region, significant warmer temperature trends continued during this
   period. Within regions, there was large variation in temperature and
   rainfall changes and some local trends were opposite to the regional
   averages. Large-scale processes of warming sea surface temperatures in
   the east coast of Mexico, a change from the positive to negative phase
   of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and increases in atmospheric CO2 may
   be influencing these trends. At the regional scale, increases in dense
   vegetation and evapotranspiration since 1990 may have created
   characteristics favoring a positive feedback of higher ocean-based
   moisture and vegetation-based precipitation cycling.},

   During the period under study the minimum temperature has increasing
   trends in almost all the stations of north east India except Cherrapunji
   where it shows decreasing trend in all the season of the year. In case
   of maximum temperature Cherrapunji, Guwahati and Imphal show increasing
   trends during all the seasons. Agartala and Shillong show increasing
   trend of maximum temperature during monsoon and post monsoon season.
   Dibrugarh and Pasighat show decreasing trend during pre monsoon season
   and increasing trend during all other seasons of the year. Gangtok shows
   decreasing trend of maximum temperature during all the seasons where as
   Silchar shows no trend in maximum temperature.
   Out of all the selected nine stations, most of the stations show either
   decreasing trend or no trend of rainfall except Guwahati which shows
   significant increasing trend of rainfall during post monsoon season.},

   influences on recent trends in South Asian monsoon rainfall},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2019},

Number = {3-4},
Pages = {2287-2302},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent studies point to combined effects of changes in regional
   land-use, anthropogenic aerosol forcing and sea surface temperature
   (SST) gradient on declining trends in the South Asian monsoon (SAM).
   This study attempted disentangling the effects produced by changes in
   SST gradient from those by aerosol levels in an atmospheric general
   circulation model. Two pairs of transient ensemble simulations were
   made, for a 40-year period from 1971 to 2010, with evolving versus
   climatological SSTs and with anthropogenic aerosol emissions fixed at
   1971 versus 2010, in each case with evolution of the other forcing
   element, as well as GHGs. Evolving SST was linked to a widespread
   feedback on increased surface temperature, reduced land-sea thermal
   contrast and a weakened Hadley circulation, with weakening of
   cross-equatorial transport of moisture transport towards South Asia.
   Increases in anthropogenic aerosol levels (1971 versus 2010), led to an
   intensification of drying in the peninsular Indian region, through
   several regional pathways. Aerosol forcing induced north-south
   asymmetries in temperature and sea-level pressure response, anda
   cyclonic circulation in the Bay of Bengal, leading toan easterly flow,
   which opposes the monsoon flow, suppressing moisture transport over
   peninsular India. Further, aerosol induced decreases in convection,
   vertically integrated moisture flux convergence, evaporation flux and
   cloud fraction, in the peninsular region, were spatially congruent with
   reduced convective and stratiform rainfall. Overall, evolution of SST
   acted through a weakening of cross-equatorial moisture flow, while
   increases in aerosol levels acted through suppression of Arabian Sea
   moisture transport, as well as, of convection and vertical moisture
   transport, to influence the suppression of SAM rainfall.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to interpret the variation of precipitation
   chemistry during the last 25 years in Montseny (NE Spain) by taking into
   account the main air mass transport routes and emission sources. To this
   end, trajectory cluster analysis and source receptor models were applied
   to an early monitoring period (1984-1993) and compared to a more recent
   one (1998-2009). A decrease of Atlantic advections and increase of
   African and European air flows was found. Cluster analysis and source
   receptor approaches showed that this region is under the influence of
   natural and anthropogenic sources from the local and long-range scale.
   Sulphate and H+ source areas extended over a vast stretch of central
   Europe in the early period, but were drastically reduced in the recent
   period, showing the effectiveness of pollution abatement measures for S.
   On the other hand, NO3- sources areas from central Europe strikingly
   increased. Ship emissions and industrialisation in Eastern Europe and
   North Africa seem to be acquiring a greater role in the recent period.

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe monthly series of the Standardized
   Precipitation Index obtained from four weather stations of the State of
   Sao Paulo, Brazil. The analyses were carried out by evaluating the
   normality assumption of the SPI distributions, the spectral features of
   these series and, the presence of climatic trends in these datasets. It
   was observed that the Pearson type Ill distribution was better than the
   gamma 2-parameter distribution in providing monthly SPI series closer to
   the normality assumption inherent to the use of this standardized index.
   The spectral analyses carried out in the time-frequency domain did not
   allow us to establish a dominant mode in the analyzed series. In
   general, the Mann-Kendall and the Pettitt tests indicated the presence
   of no significant trend in the SPI series. However, both trend tests
   have indicated that the temporal variability of this index, observed at
   the months of October over the last 60 years, cannot be seen as the
   result of a purely random process. This last inference is due to the
   concentration of decreasing trends, with a common beginning (1983/84) in
   the four locations of the study.},

Title = {Assessment of Rainfall and Temperature Trends in the Yellow River Basin,
   China from 2023 to 2100},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {China's Yellow River Basin (YRB) is sensitive to climate change due to
   its delicate ecosystem and complex geography. Water scarcity, soil
   erosion, and desertification are major challenges. To mitigate the YRB's
   ecological difficulties, climate change must be predicted. Based on the
   analysis of the evolution features of hydro-meteorological elements, the
   CMIP6 climate model dataset with Delta downscaling and the Empirical
   Orthogonal Function (EOF) is utilized to quantitatively explore the
   future variations in precipitation and temperature in the YRB. The
   following results are drawn: The spatial resolution of the CMIP6 climate
   model is less than 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees (i.e., about 55 km x 55
   km), which is improved to 1 km x 1 km by the downscaling of Delta and
   has outstanding applicability to precipitation and temperature in the
   YRB. The most accurate models for monthly mean temperature are
   CESM2-WACCM, NorESM2-LM, and ACCESS-CM2, and for precipitation are
   ACCESS-ESM1-5, CESM2-WACCM, and IPSL-CM6A-LR. Between 2023 and 2100,
   annual precipitation increases by 6.89, 5.31, 7.02, and 10.18 mm/10a
   under the ssp126, ssp245, ssp370, and ssp585 climate scenarios,
   respectively, with considerable variability in precipitation in the YRB.
   The annual temperature shows a significant upward trend, and the change
   rates under the different climate scenarios are, respectively, 0.1
   degrees C/10a, 0.3 degrees C/10a, 0.5 degrees C/10a, and 0.7 degrees
   C/10a. The increase is positively correlated with emission intensity.
   Based on the EOF analysis, temperature and precipitation mainly exhibit
   a consistent regional trend from 2023 to 2100, with the primary modal
   EOF1 of precipitation for each scenario exhibiting a clear spatial
   distribution in the southeast-northwest.},

Abstract = {Trends in extreme daily temperature and rainfall have been analysed from
   1961 to 1998 for Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. This 38-year
   period was chosen to optimize data availability across the region. Using
   high-quality data from 91 stations in 15 countries, significant
   increases were detected in the annual number of hot days and warm
   nights, with significant decreases in the annual number of cool days and
   cold nights. These trends in extreme temperatures showed considerable
   consistency across the region. Extreme rainfall trends were generally
   less spatially coherent than were those for extreme temperature. The
   number of rain days (with at least 2 mm of rain) has decreased
   significantly throughout Southeast Asia and the western and central
   South Pacific, but increased in the north of French Polynesia, in Fiji,
   and at some stations in Australia. The proportion of annual rainfall
   from extreme events has increased at a majority of stations. The
   frequency of extreme rainfall events has declined at most stations (but
   not significantly), although significant increases were detected in
   French Polynesia. Trends in the average intensity of the wettest
   rainfall events each year were generally weak and not significant.

Abstract = {Rainfall and temperature have been extensively considered as an initial
   point toward the apprehension of climate change progressions,
   establishing one of the important constituents of the hydrological
   cycle. The purpose of the present study is to examine the variability of
   rainfall and temperature for better understanding of the hydrological
   environment of the river basin located in northern Tamil Nadu.
   Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope tests were employed for monthly, seasonal,
   and annual temperatures, and also for annual maximum daily rainfall,
   seasonal, and annual rainfall statistics. A change point detection test
   was applied for annual maximum and minimum, mean temperature, and annual
   precipitation series. The results revealed that all the monthly,
   seasonal, and annual maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures have a
   significant greater rising trend. The magnitude of increasing trends in
   NEM (northeast monsoon) and SWM (southwest monsoon) are greater than
   that of summer and winter seasons for almost all the rain gauge
   stations. The maximum temperature and minimum temperature change points
   are identified in the years 1985 and 2001 and 1987 and 2013,
   respectively. From the mean annual temperature, it is seen that the
   change point is present in 1983-88 and 2000-04 at 100\% confidence

Title = {Extreme Rainfall in Southern Burkina Faso, West Africa: Trends and Links
   to Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding the space-time variations of extreme rainfall plays an
   important role in the management of water-related disasters in Sahel
   countries. This study investigates temporal changes in rainfall
   characteristics and explores the link between Atlantic Sea surface
   temperature and extreme rainfall in the southern part of Burkina Faso.
   We find substantial spatial heterogeneity in rainfall trends across the
   study area. In contrast to national and supra-national studies that
   found predominantly increasing trends in extreme rainfall, we detect
   more downward than upward trends, particularly for indices representing
   extreme rainfall. This difference is presumably a consequence of the
   high spatial variability in rainfall trends that can only be detected
   with sufficiently dense climate networks. We use the Poisson-General
   Pareto (Poisson-GP) distribution to quantify the frequency and intensity
   of extreme rainfall. Our comparison of the traditional, stationary
   Poisson-GP model with the nonstationary version where rainfall depends
   on Atlantic SST shows that the nonstationary model outperforms the
   traditional approach. This finding suggests that the assumption of
   stationary nature must be considered with care when modeling the
   frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall in the study area. Overall,
   our results suggest that the recent increase in flood disasters in
   Burkina Faso is rather caused by land use and land cover changes and
   population and urban growth and not by increasing rainfall extremes.},

Title = {Climate Change Trends in a European Coastal Metropolitan Area: Rainfall,

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This paper summarises an updated climate change trends
   analysis-developed for the period from 1 October 1864 to 30 September
   2021 within the scope of a Horizon 2020-funded project to increase
   climate resilience in European coastal cities-for a representative site
   of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Portugal). By using long ground-based
   daily records of rainfall and surface temperature at the
   Lisboa-Geofisico climatological station, the analysis aimed to identify
   (i) long-term and recent climate trends in rainfall and temperature,
   (ii) changes in extreme rainfalls, heatwaves, and droughts, and (iii)
   possible effects of the coupled changes of minimum and maximum daily
   temperatures (Tmin and Tmax, respectively) on drought development based
   on the diurnal temperature range (DTR) indicator. To detect these trends
   and quantify their magnitude, the Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator
   tests were implemented. The analysis of the mean annual temperatures
   indicated that the study area has warmed similar to 1.91 degrees C
   through the 157 analysed years. Results evidenced statistically
   significant upward trends in both Tmin and Tmax, and in the number of
   Tmax heatwave days. In what concerns the extreme hydrological events,
   the analysis of annual maximum rainfall series and peaks-over-threshold
   (POT) techniques showed more frequent and intense events in recent
   years, reaching up to similar to 120.0 mm in a single day. With regard
   to drought, the study proved that the characterisation based on the
   commonly used standardised precipitation index (SPI) might differ from
   that based on the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index
   (SPEI), as the latter can take into account not only rainfall but also
   temperature, an important trigger for the development of drought.
   According to the SPEI index, severe and extreme drought conditions have
   been more frequent in the last 60 years than in any other recorded
   period. Finally, a decreasing DTR trend towards the present was found to
   influence evapotranspiration rates and thus drought characteristics.},

Title = {Characterization of climate change in southwestern Bangladesh: trend

Abstract = {Recent studies have identified Bangladesh as one of the most vulnerable
   countries in the world with respect to climate change. The objective of
   this study was to determine the long-term trends in annual, seasonal,
   and monthly air temperature, relative humidity, heat index, and rainfall
   in the south-western region of Bangladesh. The non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope methods were applied to
   quality-controlled time series data at 7 meteorological stations
   distributed across the region to detect the significance and magnitude
   of the trends in the selected climatic variables during 1960-2010. Based
   on these analyses, (1) significant rising trends in daily maximum,
   minimum, and mean temperatures were detected at a majority of the
   stations within the area, with pronounced warming during summer months;
   (2) relative humidity showed a significant increasing trend at both
   annual and seasonal scales over the region; (3) analysis of the heat
   index, which indicates what the temperature feels like to the human body
   when relative humidity is factored in with temperature, displayed a
   distinct increase in level of discomfort, exposing the population of
   Bangladesh to heat-related health hazards; and (4) the distribution of
   monthly rainfall patterns in the region seems to be changing, with
   significant variation in rainfall trends within the monsoon season by
   6-7 mm yr(-1). The findings of this study increase our understanding of
   regional climate patterns, which can simplify larger analyses such as
   water budgets and agricultural production that depend on these types of
   data inputs, especially for the south-western region of Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {This study analyses the spatial and temporal variability and trends of
   rainfall, mean maximum and minimum temperatures at seasonal and annual
   timescales over the Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia. Statistical
   and geostatistical techniques were applied to 1634 points on 10x10km
   gridded data reconstructed from weather stations and meteorological
   satellite records. The data were obtained from the National
   Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia and cover the period between 1981 and
   2010. Trends were evaluated from slopes of regression lines using the
   least squares method. The F-distribution test was used to determine the
   statistical significance of the trends. Minimum temperatures
   significantly increased in northern, central, southern and southeastern
   parts of the Basin in all seasons. At the annual scale, maximum and
   minimum temperatures significantly increased in over 33\% of the Basin
   at a rate of 0.1 and 0.15 degrees C per decade, respectively; however,
   the western part (12\%) of the Basin experienced declining trends on
   annual and seasonal timescales. The minimum temperatures increased at a
   higher rate than the maximum temperatures during winter, summer, autumn
   and also at the annual timescale. Mean annual minimum and maximum
   temperatures increased from 12.69 to 13.32 degrees C and 26.43 to 26.91
   degrees C from 1981 to 2010, respectively. Rainfall showed statistically
   non-significant increasing trends of 35mm per decade at the annual
   timescale. All seasons except spring season exhibited similar
   statistically non-significant trends. The spring season, however, showed
   a statistically non-significant declining trend in the north eastern
   (11\%) part of the Basin.},

Title = {Temperature and rainfall trends in northern Australia 1911-2013:
   implications for human activity and regional development},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Abstract = {The climates of the earth's tropical regions are already towards the
   upper end of human thermal tolerance. The northern Australian tropical
   region is a particularly challenging environment for human physical
   activity and regional development projects. Increases in temperature and
   rainfall will exacerbate these challenges. Knowledge of past climatic
   trends and their impacts provides important information for prudent
   development planning. This paper quantifies the observed changes in
   temperature and rainfall across northern Australia for the period
   1911-2013, based on Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) temperature
   and rainfall data for 4 coastal and 3 inland locations across the
   region. We compared two 30 yr periods, 1911-1940 and 1984-2013, to the
   baseline period 1961-1990 averages and SD values. Trends were identified
   in decadal monthly temperatures, maximum temperatures > 30 degrees C and
   minimum temperatures > 21 degrees C, shifts in the daily maximum and
   minimum temperature frequency distribution curves and changes in
   seasonal rainfall above and below the +/- 1 SD values. The results
   indicate this tropical region is now warmer and wetter compared to the
   1911-1940 period with an increase in the number of days > 30 and > 33
   degrees C. Coastal warming was more pronounced than at inland locations
   and shows seasonal variations; whilst western and central inland areas
   have become wetter, little trend change was apparent in the eastern
   rainfall. With projections of further warming, development plans for the
   region need to incorporate the associated deleterious impacts on human
   activity. Such decisions will be critical in determining the success or
   failure of these projects.},

Abstract = {Projected changes in precipitation extremes can greatly impact the
   natural environment. Hence, the precipitation extremes must be precisely
   estimated with an appropriate bias correction algorithm to provide
   reliable information for the formulation of climate change impact
   adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, there is a lack of
   studies that discuss the effect of bias correction algorithms on the
   reproduction of precipitation extremes in the Blue Nile River Basin.
   This study compared three commonly used bias correction algorithms: the
   quantile mapping (QM), detrended QM (DQM), and quantile delta mapping
   (QDM). The QDM and DQM algorithms outperformed the standard QM bias
   correction algorithm in preserving the raw climate models projected
   relative changes of precipitation extremes. The performance differences
   between the standard QM and other bias correction algorithms (DQM and
   QDM) were more pronounced in the projection of extreme daily
   precipitation. Conversely, the projection of dry and wet spells was less
   sensitive for the choice of the bias correction algorithm. In general,
   the climate change impact analysis with the QDM algorithm revealed the
   increase in the frequency and severity of precipitation extremes.
   Moreover, the results showed the increase (decrease) in the maximum
   length of dry (wet) spells; indicating the increase in the severity of
   the meteorological droughts in the future that could potentially reduce
   the rain-fed agricultural productivity of the region.},

Title = {The Diversification of Air Temperature Trends in Poland (1981-2010)},
Journal = {POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2205-2209},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to answer questions such as: What is the pace
   of warming? How diversified is it in particular months? How is it
   spatially diversified in Poland in the 1981-2010 30-year period
   constituting the new, normal climate? The study was based on materials
   concerning monthly mean air temperature values from the above-mentioned
   period from 53 weather stations belonging to the network of the
   Institute of Meteorology and Water Management spread evenly across
   Poland. It was stated that warming in Poland in the 1981-2010 period,
   amounting to 0.33 degrees C/decade, resulted mainly from a spring and
   summer temperature increase of alpha = 0.05. Temperature increases
   occurred at the greatest pace in July (0.81) and April (0.73). The pace
   is slightly slower in June (0.57 degrees C), and August (0.48 degrees
   C/decade). A high trend for February (0.85 degrees C/decade) is not
   statistically significant. Trend values in October and December of 0.2
   degrees C/decade are negative but statistically insignificant. The
   regional differentiation of statistically significant temperature trends
   in Poland is as follows: in April the greatest increase in temperature
   is visible in mid-western Poland, with the lowest values in: Zielona
   Gora 0.96, Gorzow Wielkopolski 0.88, Bielsko Biala 0.85, and Poznan.
   0.84 degrees C/decade. In June, there is a decrease of trends, from the
   highest values in southwestern Poland to the lowest in northeastern
   Poland: Zielona Gora 0.79, Poznan. 0.74, Kalisz 0.61, Plock 0.57, and
   Ostroleka 0.36 degrees C/decade. In July there is a decrease of trend
   values from east to west: Suwalki 1.08, Warsaw 0.97, Poznan 0.89,
   Legnica 0.71, Zielona Gora 0.69, and Szczecin 0.57 degrees C/decade. In
   July and August a decrease in trend values can be observed from east to
   west: Zamoge 0.71, Warsaw 0.49, and Szczecin 0.27 degrees C/decade.},

Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {84-90},
Abstract = {Changes in sleep state and night-time body temperature were studied in
   13 healthy young men. Temperature data showed serial dependence that was
   removed when considering three main segments of the thermogram: an
   initial rapid drop between 60 and 140 min after lights off, followed by
   a slower decrease to the thermal minimum and a final temperature
   increase until waking. The first segment was fitted by a two-term
   function, while the other two segments were fitted by linear regression.
   Temperature data obtained after fitting these models were stationary and
   used to calculate the fast Fourier transformation and the
   cross-correlation functions between the hypnogram and the thermogram of
   each subject. Attaining stationarity has unmasked short oscillations
   during sleep and some temperature series showed the prescence of
   ultradian oscillations with a period of 90-100 min. Significant
   crosscorrelations between sleep stages and body temperature were found,
   and the parameters of the two-term function fitted to the first
   temperature drop were related to the sign of the correlation and to that
   time series (sleep or temperature) which preceded the other during the

Abstract = {The incidence of malaria in the East African highlands has increased
   since the end of the 1970s. The role of climate change in the
   exacerbation of the disease has been controversial, and the specific
   influence of rising temperature (warming) has been highly debated
   following a previous study reporting no evidence to support a trend in
   temperature. We revisit this result using the same temperature data, now
   updated to the present from 1950 to 2002 for four high-altitude sites in
   East Africa where malaria has become a serious public health problem.
   With both nonparametric and parametric statistical analyses, we find
   evidence for a significant warming trend at all sites. To assess the
   biological significance of this trend, we drive a dynamical model for
   the population dynamics of the mosquito vector with the temperature time
   series and the corresponding detrended versions. This approach suggests
   that the observed temperature changes would be significantly amplified
   by the mosquito population dynamics with a difference in the biological
   response at least 1 order of magnitude larger than that in the
   environmental variable. Our results emphasize the importance of
   considering not just the statistical significance of climate trends but
   also their biological implications with dynamical models.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The aim of this work is to study the variability of winter (monthly mean
   of DJF) air temperatures in Saudi Arabia. The study of the coefficient
   of variation (CV) of winter air temperature time series shows that the
   CV is a function of latitude, decreasing generally gradually from north
   to south. The highest values of CV during the winter season are mainly
   because of the migrating extratropical cyclones (Mediterranean cyclones)
   from west to east, and active subtropical jet, as well as the polar jet.
   The trend analysis illustrates that all stations have positive trends
   for the wintertime series. The study of decadal fluctuations in the
   behavior of winter temperature shows that the period from 1982 to 2010
   is characterized in general by negative trend values in most northern
   stations of Saudi Arabia. In the middle of Saudi Arabia, negative trend
   values also appear but for the period 1983 to 2003. The southern and
   middle stations are distinguished by a positive trend during the period
   from 2003 to 2018.},

Title = {Monthly river temperature trends across the US confound annual changes},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Climate variations and human modifications of the water cycle continue
   to alter the Earth's surface water and energy exchanges. It is therefore
   critical to ascertain how these changes impact water quality and aquatic
   ecosystem habitat metrics such as river temperatures. Though river
   temperature trend analyses exist in the literature, studies on seasonal
   trends in river temperatures across large spatial extents, e.g. the
   contiguous United States (US), are limited. As we show through both
   annual and monthly trend analyses for 20 year (n = 138 sites) and 40
   year (n = 40 sites) periods, annual temperature trends across the US
   mask extensive monthly variability. While most sites exhibited annual
   warming trends, these annual trends obscured sub-annual cooling trends
   at many sites. Monthly trend anomalies were spatially organized, with
   persistent regional patterns at both reference and human-impacted sites.
   The largest warming and cooling anomalies happened at human impacted
   sites and during summer months. Though our analysis points to coherence
   in trends as well as the overall impact of human activity in driving
   these patterns, we did not investigate the impact of river temperature
   observation accuracy on reported trends, an area needed for future work.
   Overall, these patterns emphasize the need to consider sub-annual
   behavior when managing the ecological impacts of river temperature
   throughout lotic networks.},

Title = {Recent trends in pre-monsoon daily temperature extremes over India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {119},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-65},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Extreme climate and weather events are increasingly being recognized as
   key aspects of climate change. Pre-monsoon season (March-May) is the
   hottest part of the year over almost the entire South Asian region, in
   which hot weather extremes including heat waves are recurring natural
   hazards having serious societal impacts, particularly on human health.
   In the present paper, recent trends in extreme temperature events for
   the pre-monsoon season have been studied using daily data on maximum and
   minimum temperatures over a well-distributed network of 121 stations for
   the period 1970-2005. For this purpose, time series of extreme
   temperature events have been constructed for India as a whole and seven
   homogeneous regions, viz., Western Himalaya (WH), Northwest (NW),
   Northeast (NE), North Central (NC), East coast (EC), West coast (WC) and
   Interior Peninsula (IP).
   In general, the frequency of occurrence of hot days and hot nights
   showed widespread increasing trend, while that of cold days and cold
   nights has shown widespread decreasing trend. The frequency of the
   occurrence of hot days is found to have significantly increased over EC,
   WC and IP, while that of cold days showed significant decreasing trend
   over WH and WC. The three regions EC, WC and NW showed significant
   increasing trend in the frequency of hot nights. For India as whole, the
   frequency of hot days and nights showed increasing trend while cold days
   and nights showed decreasing trends. Day-to-day fluctuations of
   pre-monsoon daily maximum and minimum temperatures have also been
   studied for the above regions. The results show that there is no
   significant change in day-to-day magnitude of fluctuations of
   pre-monsoon maximum and minimum temperatures. However, the results
   generally indicate that the daily maximum and minimum temperatures are
   becoming less variable within the season.},

Title = {Trends of temperature variability: Which variability and what health
   implications?},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {768},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {A large majority of climate change studies carried out to date are on
   changes in mean climate, which have comparatively downplayed
   variability. In terms of trend analysis or forecast, the scientific
   output and common knowledge for global warming are much more robust than
   for changes in temperature variability. Quantification of temperature
   variability adds another dimension of temporal scale, requiring immense
   labor and presenting great uncertainty. Regardless, this endeavor is
   necessary since changes in ambient temperature variabilities could also
   contribute to current and future human health burden besides changes in
   mean quantities. Here, we review the current literature on trends of
   surface air temperature variability defined at a range of timescales,
   aiming to tease out the welter of evidence and thus improving the
   scientific recognition of changes in air temperature variability in the
   context of climate change. The findings of reviewed studies from
   numerous regions differ substantially over various temporal scales. In
   general, the ambient temperature variability on short time scales (e.g.,
   diurnal or inter-day) shows a downward trend, while it is increasing on
   longer time scales (e.g., inter-annual). We then move beyond the review
   and deliver an extended discussion of potential implications for future
   research related to ambient temperature variability. We highlight the
   need to consider the methodological choices, especially timescales of
   interest, in the trend analysis as well as health impact studies.
   Continued research focusing on temperature variability at multiple
   timescales, with concerted efforts from scientists of all relevant
   stripes, is meaningful in synthesizing knowledge and reducing
   uncertainties surrounding air temperature variability. (C) 2021 Elsevier

Title = {Role of the North Atlantic Oscillation in decadal temperature trends},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Global temperatures have undergone periods of enhanced warming and
   pauses over the last century, with greater variations at local scales
   due to internal variability of the climate system. Here we investigate
   the role of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in decadal temperature
   trends in the Northern Hemisphere for periods with large decadal NAO
   trends. Using a regression based technique we find a best estimate that
   trends in the NAO more than halved (reduced by 57\%, 5\%-95\%:
   47\%-63\%) the winter warming over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics
   (NH; 30N-90N) from 1920-1971 and account for 45\% (+/- 14\%) of the
   warming there from 1963-1995, with larger impacts on regional scales.
   Over the period leading into the so-called warming hiatus, 1989-2013,
   the NAO reduced NH winter warming to around one quarter (24\%;
   19\%-31\%) of what it would have been, and caused large negative
   regional trends, for example, in Northern Eurasia. Warming is more
   spatially uniform across the Northern Hemisphere after removing the NAO
   influence in winter, and agreement with multi-model mean simulated
   trends improves. The impact of the summer NAO is much weaker, but still
   discernible over Europe, North America and Greenland, with the downward
   trend in the summer NAO from 1988-2012 reducing warming by about a third
   in Northern Europe and a half in North America. A composite analysis
   using CMIP5 control runs suggests that the ocean response to prolonged
   NAO trends may increase the influence of decadal NAO trends compared to
   estimates based on interannual regressions, particularly in the Arctic.
   Results imply that the long-term NAO trends over the 20th century
   alternately masked or enhanced anthropogenic warming, and will continue
   to temporarily offset or enhance its effects in the future.},

Abstract = {Based on monthly data about temperature from 1957 to 2007 in Huaibei
   plain. Temperature variation trends and spatial differences were
   investigated by linear trend estimation method. Results show that annual
   mean temperature has increased about 1.2 degrees C, with 0.25 degrees C
   per ten years, which is especially obvious after the 1990s; Seasonal
   increasing trends are significant except summer, with increments of 1.6,
   1.4 and 1.7 degrees C in spring, autumn, and winter, about 0.33, 0.26,
   and 0.36 degrees C per ten years, respectively; Warming rate from large
   to small was winter, spring and autumn. Suzhou and Bengbu are the most
   affected areas, which is warming obviously, increase temperature range
   is bigger; Dangshan, Bozhou, and Fuyang is the second one, warming of
   smaller amplitude.

Abstract = {Trends in daily maximum and minimum extreme temperature indices were
   investigated for 28 weather stations in South Africa, not only for the
   common period of 19622009, but also for longer periods which the
   individual record lengths of the stations would allow. The utilized
   weather stations had limited gaps in their time series, did not undergo
   major moves, or had their exposure compromised during the study period,
   as to influence the homogeneity of their time series. The indices
   calculated were forthcoming from those developed by the WMO/CLIVAR
   Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), but only
   those applicable to the South African climate were selected. The general
   result is that warm extremes increased and cold extremes decreased for
   all of the weather stations. The trends however vary on a regional
   basis, both in magnitude and statistical significance, broadly
   indicating that the western half, as well as parts of the northeast and
   east of South Africa, show relatively stronger increases in warm
   extremes and decreases in cold extremes than elsewhere in the country.
   These regions coincide to a large degree with the thermal regimes in
   South Africa which are susceptible to extreme temperatures. The annual
   absolute maximum and minimum temperatures do not reflect the general
   trends displayed by the other indices, showing that individual extreme
   events cannot always be associated with observed long-term climatic
   trends. The analyses of longer time series than the common period
   indicate that it is highly likely that warming accelerated since the
   mid-1960s in South Africa. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal Meteorological

Journal = {ECONOMETRICS JOURNAL},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {332-355},
Abstract = {The application of a partially linear model to global and hemispheric
   temperature series is proposed. Partially linear modelling allows the
   trend to take a very general form rather than imposing the restriction
   of linearity seen in existing studies. The removal of the linearity
   restriction is based on the fact that it is well accepted that a
   significant trend is present in global temperature series. The model
   will allow for the data to `speak for themselves' with regard to the
   form of the trend. The results initially reveal that a linear trend does
   not approximate well the behaviour of global or hemispheric temperature
   series. This is further confirmed through a formal testing procedure.
   The results suggest that little faith should be instilled in long-term
   forecasts of temperatures in which the trend of global and hemispheric
   series is assumed to be linear. All the current evidence suggest that
   temperatures will continue to rise in an unknown and probably nonlinear
   fashion.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {{[}1] A new technique was recently developed to study seasonal cycles of
   climatic trends of expected values, variance, skewness, and other
   statistical moments of climatic variables. Here we apply that technique
   to analyze the diurnal and seasonal cycles of trends of surface air
   temperature and its variability using hourly observations from nine
   geographically distributed meteorological stations in the United States
   for the period 1951-1999. The analysis reveals a complex pattern of
   trends in temperature and its variance at different times of the
   seasonal and diurnal cycle, showing warming trends for all stations
   during most times of the year and times of day, but with diurnal
   asymmetry of warming only in the warm half of the year. We found no
   correspondence between the trends in temperature and the trends in
   temperature variability. This analysis may be used as a prototype for
   developing the next generation of climate services that will be able to
   supply customers with detailed information about the first few moments
   of the statistical distribution of any meteorological variable for every
   day and hour of the period of observation.},

Abstract = {Despite identifying El Ni \& ntilde;o events as a factor in dengue
   dynamics, predicting the oscillation of global dengue epidemics remains
   challenging. Here, we investigate climate indicators and worldwide
   dengue incidence from 1990 to 2019 using climate-driven mechanistic
   models. We identify a distinct indicator, the Indian Ocean basin-wide
   (IOBW) index, as representing the regional average of sea surface
   temperature anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean. IOBW is closely
   associated with dengue epidemics for both the Northern and Southern
   hemispheres. The ability of IOBW to predict dengue incidence likely
   arises as a result of its effect on local temperature anomalies through
   teleconnections. These findings indicate that the IOBW index can
   potentially enhance the lead time for dengue forecasts, leading to
   better-planned and more impactful outbreak responses.},

   Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},

Abstract = {Trends in soil temperature are important, but rarely reported,
   indicators of climate change. On the basis of the soil temperature data
   from 30 climate stations across Canada during 1958-2008, trends in soil
   temperatures at 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 150 cm depths were analyzed,
   together with atmospheric variables, such as air temperature,
   precipitation, and depth of snow on the ground, observed at the same
   locations. There was a significant positive trend with soil temperatures
   in spring and summer means, but not for the winter and annual means. A
   positive trend with time in soil temperature was detected at about
   two-thirds of the stations at all depths below 5 cm. A warming trend of
   0.26-0.30 C/decade was consistently detected in spring (March-April-May)
   at all depths between 1958 and 2008. The warming trend in soil
   temperatures was associated with trends in air temperatures and snow
   cover depth over the same period. A significant decreasing trend in snow
   cover depth in winter and spring was associated with increasing air
   temperatures. The combined effects of the higher air temperature and
   reduced snow depth probably resulted in an enhanced increasing trend in
   spring soil temperatures, but no significant trends in winter soil
   temperatures. The thermal insulation by snow cover appeared to play an
   important role in the response of soil temperatures to climate change
   and must be accounted for in projecting future soil-related impacts of
   climate change.},

Abstract = {The Sun influnce on climate has been discussed globaly by many authors
   and at different latitudes. In this article we will discuss this
   connection for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which spans a large area,
   i.e. 16-32 North and 36-50 East. We started our invistigation in this
   paper by looking into the temperature at the Western coast of the
   Kingdom, namely Yenbo and Jeddah. In order to find the correlation
   between temperature and solar variations we employed one of the most
   relevant solar quentity, i.e. the solar cycle length. From our
   invistigations we found an increase in the temperature averages reaching
   up to 1.0 degree Celsius in certain cities since 1970. It is also found
   that the temperature increase is strongly correlated with the solar
   Cycle length, reaching up to 0.8 in some sites.},

Title = {TEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF TRENDS IN THE CENTRAL ENGLAND TEMPERATURE SERIES},
Journal = {CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {345-369},
Abstract = {Variations in trend rates of annual values of the Central England
   Temperature series (CET) over the period 1659-2017 were analysed using
   moving windows of different length, to identify the minimum period in
   which the trend expresses a climate signal not hidden by the noise
   produced by natural variability. Trend rates exhibit high variability
   and irregular shifting from positive to negative values unless very long
   window lengths (of 100 years or more) are used. In general, as the
   duration of the length of the temporal window analysed increases, the
   absolute range of the trend rates decreases and the signal-to-noise
   (S/N) ratio increases. The relationship between the S/N ratio and the
   window length also depended on the total length of the series, so high
   S/N values are achieved faster when shorter time series are considered.
   This prevents suggesting a minimum window length for undertaking trend
   analyses.
   A comparison between CET and the average continental series in the
   Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) database in their common
   period (1753-2017) repeats the patterns described for 1659-2017 although
   the average values of the rates, ranges and the ``threshold period{''}
   in years change, and are more variable in CET than in BEST.
   Analysis of both series suggests that the recent warming started early
   and can be linked to the recovery of temperatures after the Little Ice
   Age. This process has characterised by progressively increasing trend
   rates, but also includes periods of deceleration or even negative trends
   spanning less than 50 years. The behaviour of the two long-term
   temperature records analysed agrees with a long-term persistence (LTP)
   process. We estimated the Hurst exponent of the CET series to be around
   0.72 and 0.8, which reinforces the LTP hypothesis. This implies that the
   currently widespread statistical framework assuming a stationary,
   short-memory process in which departures from the norm can be easily
   assessed by monotonic trend analysis should not be accepted for long
   climatic series. In brief relevant questions relative to the recent
   evolution of temperatures such as the distinction between natural
   variability and departures from stationarity; attribution of the causes
   of variability at different time scales; determination of the shortest
   window length to detect a trend; and other similar ones have still not
   been answered and may require adoption of an alternative analytical
   framework.},

Abstract = {Land surface air temperature (LSAT) has been a widely used metric to
   study climate change. Weather observations of LSAT are the fundamental
   data for climate change studies and provide key evidence of global
   warming. However, there are very few meteorological observations over
   deserts due to their uninhabitable environment. This study fills this
   gap and provides independent evidence using satellite-derived land
   surface temperatures (LSTs), benefiting from their global coverage. The
   frequency of clear sky from MODerate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data over global deserts was found to be
   greater than 94\% for the 2002-2015 period. Our results show that MODIS
   LST has a bias of 1.36 degrees C compared to ground-based observations
   collected at 31 U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) stations, with a
   standard deviation of 1.83 degrees C. After bias correction, MODIS LST
   was used to evaluate existing reanalyses, including ERA-Interim,
   Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis
   for Research and Applications (MERRA), MERRA-land, National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-R1, and NCEP-R2. The reanalyses
   accurately reproduce the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of
   the LSTs, but their multiyear means and trends of LSTs exhibit large
   uncertainties. The multiyear averaged LST over global deserts is 23.5
   degrees C from MODIS and varies from 20.8 degrees C to 24.5 degrees C in
   different reanalyses. The MODIS LST over global deserts increased by
   0.25 degrees C/decade from 2002 to 2015, whereas the reanalyses
   estimated a trend varying from -0.14 to 0.10 degrees C/decade. The
   underestimation of the LST trend by the reanalyses occurs for
   approximately 70\% of the global deserts, likely due to the imperfect
   performance of the reanalyses in reproducing natural climate
   variability.},

Abstract = {Different phenomena, as the enhanced shrinking of glaciers in the Tien
   Shan and Pamiro Alay, indicate that a climate warming has occurred in
   Central Asia in the recent past. Thus the questions are since when the
   climate warming has been taking place and what its intensity has been. A
   question, which is especially investigated, is whether climate warming
   in the recent past expresses a trend-like or cyclic development of
   annual temperature averages.
   For this purpose analyses of long time series were performed, consisting
   of monthly and annual air temperature averages at selected climate
   stations representing typical locations in Central Asia. Applied were
   methods of the Regression and Correlation Analysis, in particular the
   Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), in order to identify long-term

Abstract = {Elevated water temperatures have been implicated as a factor limiting
   the recovery of anadromous salmonids in the Klamath River basin. This
   article reviews evidence of a multi-decade trend of increasing
   temperatures in the lower main-stem Klamath River above the ocean and,
   based on model simulations, finds a high probability that water
   temperature has been increasing by approximately 0.5 degrees C/decade
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.42-0.60 degrees C/decade) since the
   early 1960s. The season of high temperatures that are potentially
   stressful to salmonids has lengthened by about I month over the period
   studied, and the average length of main-stem river with cool summer
   temperatures has declined by about 8.2 km/decade. Water temperature
   trends seem unrelated to any change in main-stem water availability but
   are consistent with measured basinwide air temperature increases.
   Main-stem warming may be related to the cyclic Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation, but if this trend continues it might jeopardize the
   recovery of anadromous salmonids in the Klamath River basin.},

Abstract = {The warming trend over the last century in the northern hemisphere (NH)
   was interrupted by cooling from ad 1940 to 1975, a period during which
   the southern hemisphere experienced pronounced warming. The cause of
   these departures from steady warming at multidecadal timescales are
   unclear; the prevailing explanation is that they are driven by
   non-uniformity in external forcings but recent models suggest internal
   climate drivers may play a key role. Paleoclimate datasets can help
   provide a long-term perspective. Here we use tree-rings to reconstruct
   New Zealand mean annual temperature over the last 550 years and
   demonstrate that this has frequently cycled out-of-phase with NH mean
   annual temperature at a periodicity of around 30-60 years. Hence,
   observed multidecadal fluctuations around the recent warming trend have
   precedents in the past, strongly implicating natural climate variation
   as their cause. We consider the implications of these changes in
   understanding and modelling future climate change.},

Abstract = {Historically, meteorological observations have been made for operational
   forecasting rather than long-term monitoring purposes, so that there
   have been numerous changes in instrumentation and procedures. Hence to
   create climate quality datasets requires the identification, estimation,
   and removal of many nonclimatic biases from the historical data.
   Construction of a number of new tropospheric temperature climate
   datasets has highlighted previously unrecognized uncertainty in
   multidecadal temperature trends aloft. The choice of dataset can even
   change the sign of upper-air trends relative to those reported at the
   surface. So structural uncertainty introduced unintentionally through
   dataset construction choices is important and needs to be understood and
   mitigated. A number of ways that this could be addressed for historical
   records are discussed, as is the question of How it needs to be reduced
   through future coordinated observing systems with long-term monitoring
   as a driver, enabling explicit calculation, and removal of nonclimatic
   biases. Although upper-air temperature records are used to illustrate
   the arguments, it is strongly believed that the findings are applicable
   to all long-term climate datasets and variables. A full characterization
   of observational uncertainty is as vitally important as recent intensive
   efforts to understand climate model uncertainties if the goal to
   rigorously reduce the uncertainty regarding both past and future climate
   changes is to be achieved.},

Abstract = {Germany's national meteorological service (Deutscher Wetterdienst) is
   responsible for monitoring climate and climate change in Germany.
   Regional mean temperatures for Germany since 1881 are derived from the
   measurements of the station network on a monthly basis. Here, we discuss
   methodologies to assess the temperature trend, compare it with the
   global trends and present an overview on tools that are used for the
   communication of results. Consistent to the increase in global
   temperatures, the mean temperature in Germany also increased
   considerably, especially during the last 5 decades. The linear trend of
   the period 1881 to 2022 is approx. +1,7 \& DEG;C, but the warming
   accelerated within the last decade. Especially in the period since 1971,
   the warming rate per decade was three times higher (0.38 \&
   DEG;C/decade) than for the period since 1881 (0.12 \& DEG;C/decade). The
   temperature increase in Germany has been faster than in the global mean
   (linear trend 1971 to 2022: 0.18 \& DEG;C per decade; for 1881 to 2022:
   0.08 \& DEG; per decade). However, the temperature increase in Germany
   is comparable to the temperature increase over the global land area
   (also 0.12 \& DEG;C/decade since 1881). For the period since 1971 the
   increase is faster for Germany than for the global land area (0.29 \&
   DEG;C/decade).As a result of the accelerated warming, most years within
   the last decade had annual mean temperatures above the linear trend line
   (1881-2022) and the decade 2011 to 2020 was +2 \& DEG;C warmer in
   Germany than the first 30 years of the analysis period (1881-1910). The
   30-year period 1991 to 2020 was 1.5 \& DEG;C warmer than the period 1881
   to 1910.Several methods are used to communicate the results of the
   temperature analysis, mainly regular reports, internet portals and
   social media channels. The German Climate Atlas is a comprehensive
   interactive web-based tool that provides information on the observed
   climate in combination with information on model-based projections of
   future climate change for Germany.},

Abstract = {Accurate and reliable seasonal climate forecasts are frequently sought
   by climate-sensitive sectors to support decision-making under climate
   variability and change. Temperature trend is discernible globally over
   the past decades, but seasonal forecasts produced by a global climate
   model (GCM) generally underestimate such trend. Current statistical
   methods used for calibrating seasonal climate forecasts mostly do not
   explicitly account for climate trends. Consequently, the calibrated
   forecasts also fail to capture the observed trend. Solving this problem
   can enhance user confidence in seasonal climate forecasts. In this
   study, we extend the capability of the Bayesian joint probability (BJP)
   modelling approach for statistical calibration of seasonal climate
   forecasts. A trend component is introduced into the BJP algorithm for
   embedding the observed trend into calibrated ensemble forecasts. We
   apply the new model (named BJP-t) to three test stations in Australia.
   Seasonal forecasts of daily maximum temperatures from the SEAS5 model,
   operated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   (ECMWF), are calibrated and evaluated. The BJP-t calibrated ensemble
   forecasts can reproduce the observed trend, when the raw ensemble
   forecasts and the BJP calibrated ensemble forecasts both fail to do so.
   The BJP-t calibration leads to more skilful, more reliable and sharper
   forecasts than the BJP calibration.},

Abstract = {In order to better predict the trend of temperature in future regions, a

   Temperature and time trends of temperature and modelling, predicting

   after the above model predicts the temperature change trend for the next
   three years, the predicted temperature change trend is almost consistent

Abstract = {The upward evolution of temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula has
   weakened and even reversed in the last two decades. Due to the long-term
   variability in the region it is not easy to assess whether recent
   cooling trends are consistent with the internal variability or not. For
   this reason, this paper assesses the robustness of the trends by
   analysing their sensitivity with respect to the period selected. Every
   possible temperature trend in the interval 1958-2016 has been calculated
   and displayed in a two-dimensional parameter diagram. The results
   suggest that the warming observed in the Antarctic Peninsula since 1958
   is quite robust, as all periods longer than 30 years exhibit
   statistically significant changes, especially in summer (with lower
   magnitude and higher significance) and autumn and winter (with larger
   magnitude and lower significance). Periods shorter than 30 years exhibit
   alternations of warming and cooling periods, and therefore do not
   represent robust trends even if they are statistically significant.
   Consequently, the recent 20-year cooling trend cannot be considered at
   the moment as evidence of a shift in the overall sign of the trend.},

Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {36},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {419-430},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A series of model experiments with the coupled Max-Planck-Institute
   ECHAM5/OM climate model have been investigated and compared with
   microwave measurements from the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and
   re-analysis data for the period 1979-2008. The evaluation is carried out
   by computing the Temperature in the Lower Troposphere (TLT) and
   Temperature in the Middle Troposphere (TMT) using the MSU weights from
   both University of Alabama (UAH) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) and
   restricting the study to primarily the tropical oceans. When forced by
   analysed sea surface temperature the model reproduces accurately the
   time-evolution of the mean outgoing tropospheric microwave radiation
   especially over tropical oceans but with a minor bias towards higher
   temperatures in the upper troposphere. The latest reanalyses data from
   the 25 year Japanese re-analysis (JRA25) and European Center for Medium
   Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis are in very close agreement
   with the time-evolution of the MSU data with a correlation of 0.98 and
   0.96, respectively. The re-analysis trends are similar to the trends
   obtained from UAH but smaller than the trends from RSS. Comparison of
   TLT, computed from observations from UAH and RSS, with Sea Surface
   Temperature indicates that RSS has a warm bias after 1993. In order to
   identify the significance of the tropospheric linear temperature trends
   we determined the natural variability of 30-year trends from a 500 year
   control integration of the coupled ECHAM5 model. The model exhibits
   natural unforced variations of the 30 year tropospheric trend that vary
   within +/- 0.2 K/decade for the tropical oceans. This general result is
   supported by similar results from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
   Laboratory (GFDL) coupled climate model. Present MSU observations from
   UAH for the period 1979-2008 are well within this range but RSS is close
   to the upper positive limit of this variability. We have also compared
   the trend of the vertical lapse rate over the tropical oceans assuming
   that the difference between TLT and TMT is an approximate measure of the
   lapse rate. The TLT-TMT trend is larger in both the measurements and in
   the JRA25 than in the model runs by 0.04-0.06 K/decade. Furthermore, a
   calculation of all 30 year TLT-TMT trends of the unforced 500-year
   integration vary between +/- 0.03 K/decade suggesting that the models
   have a minor systematic warm bias in the upper troposphere.},

Abstract = {{[}1] The recent observed global warming trend over land has been
   characterised by a faster warming at night, leading to a considerable
   decrease in the diurnal temperature range (DTR). Analysis of simulations
   of a climate model including observed increases in greenhouse gases and
   sulphate aerosols reveals a similar trend in the DTR of -0.2degreesC per
   century, albeit of smaller magnitude than the observed -0.8degreesC per
   century. This trend in the model simulations is related to changes in
   cloud cover and soil moisture. These results indicate that the observed
   decrease in the DTR could be a signal of anthropogenic forcing of recent
   climate change.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The identification and estimation of trends in hydroclimatic time series
   remains an important task in applied climate research. The statistical
   challenge arises from the inherent nonlinearity, complex dependence
   structure, heterogeneity and resulting non-standard distributions of the
   underlying time series. Quantile regressions are considered an important
   modeling technique for such analyses because of their rich
   interpretation and their broad insensitivity to extreme distributions.
   This paper provides an asymptotic justification of quantile trend
   regression in terms of unknown heterogeneity and dependence structure
   and the corresponding interpretation. An empirical application sheds
   light on the relevance of quantile regression modeling for analyzing
   monthly Central England temperature anomalies and illustrates their
   various heterogenous trends. Our results suggest the presence of
   heterogeneities across the considered seasonal cycle and an increase in
   the relative frequency of observing unusually high temperatures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {15},
Number = {22},
Pages = {3188-3205},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A long-term, homogeneous set of daily maximum and minimum temperature
   data representing a subset of daily U. S. Historical Climatology Network
   stations is used to analyze trends in extreme temperature occurrence
   across the contiguous United States. Time series of various lengths are
   analyzed, with the longest spanning the period 1900-96. Trends in the
   annual occurrence of extreme maximum and minimum temperatures (e. g.,
   values greater than the 90th, 95th, or 99th percentile) are strongly
   influenced by high exceedence counts during drought periods in the 1930s
   and 1950s. Peaks in exceedences during these years result in
   predominantly decreasing warm exceedence trends across the country
   during the 1930-96 period. This is uncharacteristic of recent years
   (1960-96) in which a large majority of stations show increases in warm
   extreme temperature exceedences. Significant increases in warm minimum
   temperature exceedences are found at nearly one-third of the stations
   during this period. Multiday warm temperature exceedence runs also show
   strong increases during this more recent period. The most rapid
   increases in high maximum and minimum temperature extremes occur at
   stations classified as urban, by satellite land use information.
   Trends in the annual occurrence of extremely cold maximum and minimum
   temperatures display an analogous decrease during the 1960-96 period.
   Here again, there is a distinct shift in the number of decreasing trends
   between the 1950-96 and 1960-96 periods. Based on starting decades prior
   to 1960, there is not a strong tendency for either increasing or
   decreasing trends. The period 1910-96 is an exception, with almost all
   stations exhibiting decreasing cold extreme occurrence trends. The
   extreme cold exceedence trends during the 1960-96 period are also
   influenced by urbanization, but to a lesser degree than the warm
   extremes.},

   spatiotemporal trends in temperature},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Body temperature is universally recognized as a dominant driver of
   biological performance. Although the critical distinction between the
   temperature of an organism and its surrounding habitat has long been
   recognized, it remains common practice to assume that trends in air
   temperature-collected via remote sensing or weather stations-are
   diagnostic of trends in animal temperature and thus of spatiotemporal
   patterns of physiological stress and mortality risk. Here, by analysing
   long-term trends recorded by biomimetic temperature sensors designed to
   emulate intertidal mussel temperature across the US Pacific Coast, we
   show that trends in maximal organismal temperature ('organismal
   climatologies') during aerial exposure can differ substantially from
   those exhibited by co-located environmental data products. Specifically,
   using linear regression to compare maximal organismal and environmental
   (air temperature) climatologies, we show that not only are the
   magnitudes of body and air temperature markedly different, as expected,
   but so are their temporal trends at both local and biogeographic scales,
   with some sites showing significant decadal-scale increases in
   organismal temperature despite reductions in air temperature, or vice
   versa. The idiosyncratic relationship between the spatiotemporal
   patterns of organismal and air temperatures suggests that environmental
   climatology cannot be statistically corrected to serve as an accurate
   proxy for organismal climatology. Finally, using quantile regression, we
   show that spatiotemporal trends vary across the distribution of
   organismal temperature, with extremes shifting in different directions
   and at different rates than average metrics. Overall, our results
   highlight the importance of quantifying changes in the entire
   distribution of temperature to better predict biological performance and
   dispel the notion that raw or `corrected' environmental (and specially
   air temperature) climatologies can be used to predict organismal
   temperature trends. Hence, despite their widespread coverage and
   availability, the severe limitations of environmental climatologies
   suggest that their role in conservation and management policy should be
   carefully considered.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Climate predictions of air temperature in coastal regions represent a
   great challenge due to the complex interactions among the atmosphere,
   sea, and land. With approximately 1,200 islands, the Adriatic is a
   region with a strong land-sea contrast, land-atmosphere feedback, and
   intense air-sea interaction. Because the Mediterranean has been regarded
   as a ``hot spot{''} for climate change, regional climate models can be
   used to provide insight into a more realistic representation of
   small-scale weather and climate structure and variability. This
   advantage is due to the better representation of complex topography,
   developed coastlines, and land-sea contrasts, which are important for
   investigating air temperature trends. The use of regional climate models
   together with high-resolution reanalyses and observations in assessments
   of climate variability and climate change is highly valuable for
   understanding climate processes at regional scales. The present study
   focused on air temperature and its trends calculated from measurements
   and simulated by eight regional climate models from the EURO-CORDEX
   database; these data were represented by UERRA reanalyses and E-OBS
   gridded data. In the evaluation period (1989-2008), the models' RMSEs
   were fairly small, in the range 0.5-1.5 degrees C, compared to the
   historical period (1961-2005), with RMSEs greater than 1.75 degrees C.
   However, the models showed small absolute trend differences (up to 0.12
   degrees C center dot decade(-1) for the historical period). The ensemble
   means in both periods showed an accuracy improvement of 15-20\% compared
   to the individual models. The models exhibited more success in terms of
   representing the main statistics and variability of the air temperature
   structure than in reproducing the temperature trends over 45 years,
   especially in the northern Adriatic, where there is complex coastal
   topography and significant seasonal variability in the wind regime. The
   reanalyses well represented temperature structure but showed less
   success in explaining the temperature trends than the results from the
   measured data.},

Abstract = {In this study, we report for the first time, the upper air temperature
   climatology, and trends over the Middle East, which seem to be
   significantly affected by the changes associated with hot summer and low
   precipitation. Long term (1985-2012) radiosonde data from 12 stations
   are used to derive the mean temperature climatology and vertical trends.
   The study was performed by analyzing the data at different latitudes.
   The vertical profiles of air temperature show distinct behavior in terms
   of vertical and seasonal variability at different latitudes. The
   seasonal cycle of temperature at the 100 hPa, however, shows an opposite
   pattern compared to the 200 hPa levels. The temperature at 100 hPa shows
   a maximum during winter and minimum in summer. Spectral analysis shows
   that the annual cycle is dominant in comparison with the semiannual
   cycle. The time-series of temperature data was analyzed using the
   Bayesian change point analysis and cumulative sum method to investigate
   the changes in temperature trends. Temperature shows a clear change
   point during the year 1999 at all stations. Further, Modified
   Mann-Kendall test was applied to study the vertical trend, and analysis
   shows statistically significant lower tropospheric warming and cooling
   in upper troposphere after the year 1999. In general, the magnitude of
   the trend decreases with altitude in the troposphere. In all the
   latitude bands in lower troposphere, significant warming is observed,
   whereas at higher altitudes cooling is noticed based on 28 years
   temperature observations over the Middle East. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Urbanization effects on temperature trends of Lahore during 1950-2007},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {274+},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the trends of changing
   temperature of Lahore in Pakistan due to invigorating urbanization
   process since 1950-2007.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research is designed by using the
   numerical time series data of mean minimum temperature (MMiT), mean
   maximum temperature (MMxT) and mean annual temperature (MAT). The growth
   in urban population, area and transportation are also evaluated by using
   the available data. Linear regression method is applied to investigate
   the results of change in temperature. Three different approaches to
   examine the MAT are testified; first as an entire period (1950-2007),
   and then by dividing the entire period into two equal phases as Phase I
   (1950-1974) and Phase II (1975-2207). MMiT and MMxT are analysed for the
   entire period without making any division.
   Findings - The results of the paper are significantly indicating an
   increase in MAT and MMiT which have risen up to 0.89 and 2.51 degrees C,
   respectively, while MMxT remained resolute throughout the study period.
   Change in MMiT is observed regular and brisk than other parameters of
   temperature. Increase in temperature in Phase I is observed only 0.062
   degrees C and in Phase II it is observed 0.94 degrees C.
   Research limitations/implications - This research can be further worked
   out by using different meteorological models to study the effects of
   urbanization on lower surface atmosphere and urban heat island effects
   in Lahore.
   Originality/value - By taking into consideration these results, the town
   planners and government can make different strategies to mitigate the
   urban effects on rising temperature in Pakistan.},

Abstract = {This review examines research reported in the past decade in the field
   of the fabrication of batteries based on the sodium-sulfur system,
   capable of operating at an ambient temperature (room-temperature
   sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries). Such batteries differ from currently
   widespread lithium-ion or lithium-sulfur analogs in that their starting
   materials are cheaper and more readily available. One of the key
   problems to be resolved on the way to room-temperature Na-S batteries
   with high energy density and long-term cycling stability is transport of
   cell reaction products (sodium polysulfides) to the opposite electrode,
   which leads to an appreciable battery self-discharge and loss of the
   active material as a result of redox reactions that are not accompanied
   by energy generation. This review is aimed at examining approaches to
   improving the electrochemical performance of the room-temperature Na-S
   batteries. Particular attention is paid to potential applications of
   cation-exchange materials capable of suppressing polysulfide anion
   transport, with a high sodium cation transport rate retained.},

Series = {Geological Society of America Memoir},

Abstract = {In this paper, we merge more than 200 new apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He
   analyses and 21 apatite fission-track analyses from 71 new samples with
   previous published thermochronologic data using the same systems to
   understand the growth and largescale kinematics of the central Andes
   between 21 degrees S and 28 degrees S. In general, minimum dates
   decrease and the total range of dates increases from west to east across
   the range. Large variations in thermochronometer dates on the east side
   reflect high spatial gradients in depth of recent erosional exhumation.
   Almost nowhere in this part of the Andes has Cenozoic erosion exceeded
   similar to 6-8 km, and in many places in the eastern half of the range,
   erosion has not exceeded 2-3 km, despite these regions now being 5-6 km
   above sea level. This means that west of the rapidly deforming and
   eroding eastern range front, uplift and erosion are largely decoupled as
   a result of meager precipitation, relatively low relief, internal
   drainage, and volcanic burial. We interpret the west-to-east pattern of
   decreasing minimum dates across the range as recording the
   time-transgressive eastward migration of a focused zone of deformation,
   erosion, and convergence between the South American plate and the
   eastern edge of the Andean orogenic plateau. At this scale, the
   thermochronologic data do not suggest major changes in rates of plateau
   propagation or shortening/convergence with time. We use the
   thermochronometer date-distance trend and a simple kinematic model to
   infer a rate of eastward propagation of deformation and plateau growth
   of 6-10 km/m.y. This plateau propagation model balances horizontal
   convergence, erosion, and crustal thickening and predicts rates of
   shortening and convergence between the Andes block and South American
   plate that are consistent with geologic and geodetic observations.},

Abstract = {Trends in minimum and maximum air temperature and in the diurnal thermal
   range (DTR), and derived indices of extreme temperatures since the
   1960's are assessed for southern Brazil. Most meteorological stations
   show steep increases in the night-time temperatures (depicted by the
   minimum temperature) as compared to slight increases in the daytime
   temperature (depicted by the maximum temperature), both year round and
   at the seasonal level. The warming trends are stronger during winter as
   compared to summer. Consequently, the observed annual and seasonal
   negative DTR trends in southern Brazil during the last 40 years are
   largely due to the greater increase in nighttime temperatures rather
   than daytime temperatures. At decadal timescales, the presence of more
   intense and frequent El Nino events during the last 20 years also
   contributes to warming and explains the steep increase in the air
   temperature extremes trends during this period, as compared to the
   relatively colder 1960-1980 period, especially for winter.
   Indices of temperature extremes defined using fixed limits for maximum
   and minimum temperatures for colder or warmer days were compared with
   percentile-based indices defined in the recent literature. The
   comparison shows that the frequency of warmer days increased during both
   summer and winter, especially during the last two decades. The observed
   positive tendencies in minimum temperatures and warmer days during
   winter occur even though extreme cold events and freezing conditions
   occurred in 1975, 1994 and 2000. Copyright (C) 2007 Royal Meteorological

Abstract = {We evaluate the claim by Gay et al. (Clim Change 94:333-349, 2009) that
   ``surface temperature can be better described as a trend stationary
   process with a one-time permanent shock{''} than efforts by Kaufmann et
   al. (Clim Change 77:249-278, 2006) to model surface temperature as a
   time series that contains a stochastic trend that is imparted by the
   time series for radiative forcing. We test this claim by comparing the
   in-sample forecast generated by the trend stationary model with a
   one-time permanent shock to the in-sample forecast generated by a
   cointegration/error correction model that is assumed to be stable over
   the 1870-2000 sample period. Results indicate that the in-sample
   forecast generated by the cointegration/error correction model is more
   accurate than the in-sample forecast generated by the trend stationary
   model with a one-time permanent shock. Furthermore, Monte Carlo
   simulations of the cointegration/error correction model generate time
   series for temperature that are consistent with the
   trend-stationary-with-a-break result generated by Gay et al. (Clim
   Change 94:333-349, 2009), while the time series for radiative forcing
   cannot be modeled as trend stationary with a one-time shock. Based on
   these results, we argue that modeling surface temperature as a time
   series that shares a stochastic trend with radiative forcing offers the
   possibility of greater insights regarding the potential causes of
   climate change and efforts to slow its progression.},

Abstract = {The free atmosphere is an essential part of the climate system, and the
   processes in the free atmosphere are strongly interrelated with the
   processes in other climate system components. Temperature in the free
   atmosphere is better studied than other parameters defining the
   upper-air climate, but nevertheless there exist numerous problems in the
   upper-air temperature trends. This paper gives the overview of the
   current status of radiosonde based empirical studies of the upper-air
   temperature climate changes. Problems such as data availability, data
   quality and completeness, inhomogeneity detection in the upper-air
   temperature time series, temperature trend estimates, overall patterns
   of upper-air trends are discussed in the paper. Special attention is
   given to the problem of whether the reanalysis outputs can reproduce
   trends over long periods in the upper-air temperature series.},

Journal = {NATURE},

Number = {6987},

Abstract = {From 1979 to 2001, temperatures observed globally by the
   mid-tropospheric channel of the satellite-borne Microwave Sounding Unit
   (MSU channel 2), as well as the inferred temperatures in the lower
   troposphere, show only small warming trends of less than 0.1 K per
   decade (refs 1 - 3). Surface temperatures based on in situ observations
   however, exhibit a larger warming of similar to0.17 K per decade ( refs
   4, 5), and global climate models forced by combined anthropogenic and
   natural factors project an increase in tropospheric temperatures that is
   somewhat larger than the surface temperature increase(6-8). Here we show
   that trends in MSU channel 2 temperatures are weak because the
   instrument partly records stratospheric temperatures whose large cooling
   trend(9) offsets the contributions of tropospheric warming. We quantify
   the stratospheric contribution to MSU channel 2 temperatures using MSU
   channel 4, which records only stratospheric temperatures. The resulting
   trend of reconstructed tropospheric temperatures from satellite data is
   physically consistent with the observed surface temperature trend. For
   the tropics, the tropospheric warming is similar to1.6 times the surface
   warming, as expected for a moist adiabatic lapse rate.},

Title = {Contrasting temperature trends across the ice-free part of Greenland},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Temperature changes in the Arctic have notable impacts on ecosystem
   structure and functioning, on soil carbon dynamics, and on the stability
   of permafrost, thus affecting ecosystem functions and putting man-built
   infrastructure at risk. Future warming in the Arctic could accelerate
   important feedbacks in permafrost degradation processes. Therefore it is
   important to map vulnerable areas most likely to be impacted by
   temperature changes and at higher risk of degradation, particularly near
   communities, to assist adaptation to climate change. Currently, these
   areas are poorly assessed, especially in Greenland. Here we quantify
   trends in satellite-derived land surface temperatures and modelled air
   temperatures, validated against observations, across the entire ice-free
   Greenland. Focus is on the past 30 years, to characterize significant
   changes and potentially vulnerable regions at a 1 km resolution. We show
   that recent temperature trends in Greenland vary significantly between
   seasons and regions and that data with resolutions down to single km(2)
   are critical to map temperature changes for guidance of further local
   studies and decision-making. Only a fraction of the ice-free Greenland
   seems vulnerable due to warming when analyzing year 2001-2015, but the
   most pronounced changes are found in the most populated parts of
   Greenland. As Greenland represents important gradients of north/south
   coast/inland/distance to large ice sheets, the conclusions are also
   relevant in an upscaling to greater Arctic areas.},

Abstract = {There is as yet scanty published information on climate trends at a
   local scale within the central Mediterranean region. This is the most
   updated study that focuses on detailed understanding of air temperature
   shifts based on standard observations gathered from the Maltese islands.
   This analysis leads to a number of conclusions, most significant being
   (1) that the rate of change in the mean temperature is +1.1 A degrees C
   between 1951 and 2010, (2) a warming trend of +1.2 and +1.1 A degrees C
   exists in the maximum and minimum temperature, respectively, over the
   same period, (3) that the strongest anomalous warming has occurred
   during the last 30 years, particularly during the months of June, August
   and October, and (4) the local temperature trend is in the same category
   of air temperature trends detected in the nearby Island of Sicily
   (Catania, Italy), Perpignan (France) and Dar el-Beida (Algeria). Local
   data also show differences in the temperature trends, especially
   pronounced between the two 30-year periods of 1951-1980 and 1981-2010.
   This study provides an understanding of temperature shifts at
   recommended small spatio-temporal scales.},

Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {665-681},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {For U.S., Argentine and Australian cities, yearly mean urban to rural
   temperature differences (Delta(u-r)) and rural temperatures (T-r) are
   negatively correlated in almost every case, suggesting that urban heat
   island intensity depends, among other parameters on the temperature
   itself. This negative correlation is related to the fact that
   interannual variability of temperature is generally lower in urban
   environments than in rural areas. This seems to hold true at low
   frequencies leading to opposite trends in the two variables. Hence,
   urban stations are prone to have lower trends in absolute value than
   rural ones.
   Therefore, regional data sets including records from urban locations, in
   addition to urban growth bias may have a second type of urban bias
   associated with temperature trends. A bulk estimate of this second urban
   bias trend for the contiguous United States during 1901-1984 indicates
   that it could be of the same order as the urban growth bias and of
   opposite sign.
   If these results could be extended to global data, it could be expected
   that the spurious influence of urban growth on global temperature trends
   during warming periods will be offset by the diminishing of the urban
   heat island intensity.},

Abstract = {High frequency, multi-year ground temperature measurements (every eight
   hours) obtained for the Norman Wells to Zama Pipeline Thermal Monitoring
   Program were used to create synthetic `manual' data subsets with
   measurement intervals between 30 and 90 days. Mean annual temperatures
   were estimated from the subsets using cubic spline interpolation. By
   repeatedly producing collections of subsets with a given long term
   measurement interval, the uncertainty about the underlying temperature
   wave when sampled at that interval could be summarized using standard
   statistical measures (averages and standard deviations). Analysis of
   data from 0.5-5.3 m deep sensors indicates a predictable pattern of
   uncertainty for any given measurement interval. The annual temperature
   regime is estimated with increasing precision at greater depths for a
   given time interval. The standard deviation of the temperature estimates
   tends to be greatest where the change in curvature of the true
   temperature time series is greatest. At all depths, the standard
   deviation of both the instantaneous and the mean annual temperature
   estimates is a nearly constant proportion of the annual variation at
   that depth. The magnitude of error that will result for a given
   measurement interval can be estimated using the annual temperature
   range.},

Title = {Role of Natural and Anthropogenic Loadings on Indian Temperature Trends},
Journal = {PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS},

Abstract = {We evaluate the impact of natural and anthropogenic loadings on Indian
   maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) temperature variabilities during
   1901-2015 using multiple spectral and statistical analyses. We compare
   the significant eigenmodes of temperature with TSI, Ocean and
   Atmospheric Processes (OAP) such as ENSO, PDO, NAO, AMO and CO2 data to
   understand their influence on temperature. The present analysis is based
   on new eigen-weighted correlation coefficient (EWCC) and regression
   analysis to assess the sensitivity of temperature to TSI, OAP and CO2.
   The first eigenmodes (EM) of T-max and T-min representing the long-term
   trend correlate well with the first EM of TSI (EWCC: 0.90 and 0.78) and
   CO2 (EWCC: 0.95 and 0.72), respectively. The CO2 residing throughout the
   day and night in the atmosphere may produce a similar linearly
   increasing trend in T-max and T-min. However, the trend test revealed
   non-stationarity in the trends of T-max and T-min. In addition, the
   regression analysis revealed high sensitivity of the T-max and T-min
   trend to TSI compared with CO2. Our study suggests that there is an
   intermittent change in the running mean of TSI between 1901 and 2015
   resulting in observed changes in T-max. In addition, spectral analysis
   of the T-max and T-min records revealed statistical significant
   periodicities of similar to 2-7 years and 11 +/- 2 years in T-max and
   similar to 2-7 years and 50 +/- 4 years in T-min, which may be
   associated with OAP and TSI, respectively. Based on the present
   analyses, we conclude that there are combined responses of (1) intrinsic
   variation in TSI and CO2, which may be interpreted as the major loading
   factors on the trend of T-max and T-min, respectively; (2) periodic
   variabilities in different frequency bands may be associated with both
   solar and ocean atmospheric processes depending upon time scales.},

Abstract = {The stratospheric temperature trend plays an important role in
   distinguishing between the climate systems responses to natural and
   human induced changes. A linear trend of monthly mean temperature from
   the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset for both Hemispheres with 2.5 degrees
   step in latitude and longitude for the period 1979-2011, were calculated
   on this paper. Four different stratospheric heights: 10 hPa, 30 hPa, 50
   hPa, and 70 hPa were analyzed. The observed trend pattern changes with
   height as expected. The area of negative trends increases when we go up
   in the stratosphere. Lower and middle stratosphere shows positive
   trends, in a section of the latitudinal band between 50 degrees S and 60
   degrees S. As we go down the stratosphere these positive trends are
   smoother. At 10 hPa all trends are negative. In Southern Hemisphere at
   30 hPa significant negative trends at low middle latitudes were
   observed. These results were compared with others, obtained by models
   and observations. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Evaluation of Historical Diurnal Temperature Range Trends in CMIP5
   Models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {22},
Pages = {9077-9089},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Diurnal temperature range (DTR) is a useful index of climatic change in
   addition to mean temperature changes. Observational records indicate
   that DTR has decreased over the last 50 yr because of differential
   changes in minimum and maximum temperatures. However, modeled changes in
   DTR in previous climate model simulations of this period are smaller
   than those observed, primarily because of an overestimate of changes in
   maximum temperatures. This present study examines DTR trends using the
   latest generation of global climate models participating in phase 5 of
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and utilizes the novel
   CMIP5 detection and attribution experimental design of variously forced
   historical simulations (natural-only, greenhouse gas-only, and all
   anthropogenic and natural forcings). Comparison of observed and modeled
   changes in DTR over the period of 1951-2005 again reveals that global
   DTR trends are lower in model simulations than observed across the
   27-member multimodel ensemble analyzed here. Modeled DTR trends are
   similar for both experiments incorporating all forcings and for the
   historical experiment with greenhouse gases only, while no DTR trend is
   discernible in the naturally forced historical experiment. The
   persistent underestimate of DTR changes in this latest multimodel
   evaluation appears to be related to ubiquitous model deficiencies in
   cloud cover and land surface processes that impact the accurate
   simulation of regional minimum or maximum temperatures changes observed
   during this period. Different model processes are likely responsible for
   subdued simulated DTR trends over the various analyzed regions.},

Abstract = {We examine trends in surf ace air temperature for the San Juan Mountain
   region in southwestern Colorado from 1895 to 2005. Observations from
   both National Weather Service (NWS) and Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites
   are analyzed. Results show a net warming of 1 degrees C between 1895 and
   2005. Most of this warming occurred between 1990 and 2005, when the
   region experienced rapid and secular increases in temperature. Between
   1950 and 1985, there was a cooling trend in the region during which
   there were significant decreases in the maximum temperature (T-max) and
   almost no trend in the minimum temperature (T-min). This cooling trend
   appears to be, in part, associated with increases in atmospheric
   aerosols. Between 1990 and 2005, the large increases in temperature
   anomalies are strongly correlated at the NWS and SNOTEL sites. Annual
   increases in T-max and T-min are similar between 1990 and 2005; however,
   they generally show greater increases during summer and winter,
   respectively. Spatially, there are similar increases in T-max and T-min
   except in the central mountain region, where the increases in T-min are
   larger and started earlier.},

   chan.-e On the other hand. anomalous warming trend is detected for
   stations with larger population density Even for only weakly populated

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {74},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Spatiotemporal changes in land surface temperature (LST) over South Asia
   were estimated using MODIS (moderate resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer) data from 2000 to 2021. We calculated the monthly and
   annual LST trends and magnitudes by applying the Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's slope estimator at both ecoregion and pixel level. More ecoregions
   experienced daytime cooling than warming. Central and west South Asia
   showed the highest daytime cooling in December compared to the nighttime
   warming in the central and northwest in July and September. Nineteen
   ecoregions demonstrated monthly daytime cooling trends at the 99\%
   confidence level (CL), with the highest record observed in ecoregion
   `Indus Valley desert' in March with the magnitudes of -0.26 degrees
   C/yr. While the monthly and annual nighttime warming magnitude was the
   maximum in `Gissaro-Alai open woodlands' in December (0.19 degrees C/yr
   at 95\% CL), and `Indus River Delta-Arabian Sea mangroves' at annual
   scale (0.06 degrees C/yr at 99\% CL). To understand the influence of
   large-scale atmospheric oscillations on the trends, we also correlated
   the estimated LST trends with the selected oscillation indices. Sea
   surface temperature (SST) Nin similar to o 3.4 showed the most
   significant influence on the trends, where it was positively correlated
   with 38 ecoregions during nighttime over the year. A better
   understanding of temperature trends and impacts on South Asia would
   guide sustainable development and ensures the excessive demands on food,
   water, and energy supplies coping with the growing population.},

Abstract = {Time series of seasonal temperatures recorded in Alaska during the past
   eighty years are analyzed. A common practice to measure changes in the
   long-term pattern of temperature series is to fit a deterministic linear
   trend. A deterministic trend is not a realistic approach and poses some
   pitfalls from the statistical point of view. A statistical model to fit
   a latent time-varying level independent of the Pacific climate shift is
   proposed. The empirical distribution of temperature conditional on the
   phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is obtained. The results reveal
   that the switch between the negative and the positive phase leads to
   differences in temperatures up to 4A degrees C in a given location and
   season. Differences across seasons and locations are detected. The
   effect of the Pacific climate shift is stronger in winter. An overall
   increase of temperatures is observed in the long term. The estimated
   trends are not constant but exhibit different patterns that vary in the
   sign and strength over the sample period.},

Title = {Trend and interannual variability of temperature in Malaysia: 1961-2002},

Volume = {89},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the warming trend and interannual variability of
   surface air temperatures in the Malaysian region during the period
   1961-2002. The trend analyses show that most regions in Malaysia
   experience warming over the period at comparable rates to those in
   regions surrounding the Bay of Bengal. The regions of Peninsular
   Malaysia and northern Borneo experience warming rates of between 2.7-4.0
   degrees C/100 years. However, the warming rates are lower in the
   south-western region of Borneo. The interannual variability of Malaysian
   temperature is largely dominated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO). Regardless of the warming trends, all regions in Malaysia
   experience uniform warming during an El Nino event, particularly during
   the October-November-December (OND) and the January-February-March (JFM)
   periods. This uniform warming is associated with the latent heat
   released from the central eastern Pacific region and forced adiabatic
   subsidence in the Maritime Continent during an El Nino event. During its
   early development period i.e. during the July-August-September (JAS)
   season, the El Nino's impact on the Malaysian temperatures is relatively
   weak compare to its influence during the OND and JFM seasons. However,
   the warming continues to the April-May-June (AMJ) season although during
   this period the anomalous conditions in the eastern central Pacific have
   begun or have returned to normal. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode
   exerts an influence on Malaysian temperatures. When it co-occurs with
   ENSO, it tends to weaken the ENSO influence particularly during an OND
   period. However, it appears to have an appreciable influence only during
   an AMJ period when it occurs in the absence of an ENSO event. Despite
   the strong influence of the ENSO, the warming rates during the 42-year
   period appears to be least affected by interannual variability.},

Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {This study aims to identify patterns and trends of the night land
   surface temperature over eight day period from 2000 to 2014 in Africa
   using statistical analysis. Data were obtained from the United States
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite, comprising 99
   locations of 5 degrees by 5 degrees latitude and longitude grid-boxes
   between latitudes 35 degrees north and south of the equator and
   longitudes 20 degrees west to 50 degrees east. First, the variation in
   the night surface temperatures was removed. Then, the trend of
   seasonally adjusted night temperatures was estimated using linear
   regression. The correlations between adjoining regions were considered
   by using factor analysis to classify the temperatures into four regions.
   Cubic spline models were fitted to the data within these regions to
   investigate patterns of the temperatures. The result showed that
   temperatures in most regions of Africa increased. The temperatures
   decreased was observed in southern Africa and parts of central and
   eastern Africa.},

Abstract = {The responses of plant phenology to temperature variability have many
   consequences for ecological processes, agriculture, forestry, and human
   health. Temperature sensitivity (S-T) of phenology could measure how and
   to what degree plant could phenologically track climate change. The
   long-term trends and spatial patterns in S-T have been well studied for
   vegetative phenology such as leaf unfolding, but trends to be expected
   for reproductive phenology in the future remain unknown. Here we
   investigate trends and factors driving the temporal variation of S-T of
   first bloom date (FBD). Using the long-term FBD records during 1963-2013
   for common lilac (Syringa vulgaris) from 613 stations in Europe, we
   compared changes in S-T from the beginning to the end of the study
   period. The Spearman partial correlations were used to assess the
   importance of four influencing factors. The results showed that the
   temporal changes in S-T of FBD varied considerably among time scales.
   Mean S-T decreased significantly by 0.92days degrees C-1 from 1963-1972
   to 2004-2013 (P<0.01), but remained stable from 1963-1987 to 1989-2013.
   The strength of FBD and temperature relationship, the spring temperature
   variance, and winter chill all impact S-T in an expected way at most
   stations. No consistent responses of S-T on photoperiod were found. Our
   results imply that the trends and variability in S-T of flowering
   phenology are driving by multiple factors and impacted by time scales.
   Continued efforts are still needed to further examine the
   flowering-temperature relationship for other plant species in other
   climates and environments using similar methods to our study.},

Abstract = {Annual and seasonal trends in temperature, dewpoint, relative humidity,
   and specific humidity are presented for the period 1953-2005. The
   analysis uses hourly observations from 75 climatological stations across
   Canada. Data were examined for discontinuities due to changes in
   instruments and observing practice. It was found that the main
   discontinuity corresponds to the replacement of the psychrometer by the
   dewcel in the early 1970s, which created an artificial negative step in
   relative humidity and dewpoint at many locations. After accounting for
   these discontinuities, the results of trend analysis show evidence of an
   increase in air moisture content associated with the warming observed in
   the country. During winter and spring, the significant warming in the
   western and southern regions is accompanied by an increase in dewpoint
   and specific humidity and by a decrease in relative humidity; in summer,
   warming is observed in the southeast and it is associated with
   significant positive trends in dewpoint and specific humidity. Although
   there is no strong evidence of a greater nighttime warming in Canada
   over 1953-2005, the nighttime dewpoint and specific humidity trends are
   slightly larger than the daytime trends, especially during the spring
   and summer.},

Abstract = {Marked differences from global trends in terms of diurnal asymmetry of
   temperature trends were reported earlier for India, indicating that the

   While all-India mean annual temperature has shown significant warming
   trend of 0.05 degrees C/10yr during the period 1901-2003, the recent
   period 1971-2003 has seen a relatively accelerated warming of 0.22
   degrees C/10yr, which is largely due to unprecedented warming during the
   last decade. Further, in a major shift, the recent period is marked by
   rising temperatures during the monsoon season, resulting in a weakened
   seasonal asymmetry of temperature trends reported earlier. The recent
   accelerated warming over India is manifest equally in daytime and

Abstract = {Warm extreme temperature events or `heatwaves' have disastrous impacts.
   Several high-impact heatwave events have recently occurred in the Global
   North, resulting in significant losses of human life and dire effects on
   economies. The expected increases in the frequency and intensity of
   extreme heat events under climate change pose a significant threat to
   South Africa. South Africa, a developing country, with an increasing
   population, faces many socioeconomic challenges. This study presents the
   first comprehensive annual and seasonal, spatial and temporal trend
   analyses of daily maximum and minimum extreme temperature events
   recorded from 20 meteorological stations across South Africa, spanning
   1960-2016. Trend results based on the World Meteorological Organization
   Expert Team on Climate Change Detection (ETCCDI) and the World
   Meteorological Organization Commission for Climatology and Indices
   Expert Team on Sector-Specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI). Indices
   describing the characteristics of warm extremes are calculated using
   RClimDex and ClimPACT, respectively. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test, Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Sen's slope estimates
   were used to determine the statistical significance and magnitude of the
   calculated trend. Results show a general annual trend increase in
   maximum temperature at a rate of 0.02 degrees C year(-1). The majority
   of stations reveals statistically significant trends in warm days and
   nights; with the strongest, general annual trend increases experienced
   in warm days at a rate of 0.15\% year(-1). Seasonally, the strongest
   increases of 0.11\% days year(-1) in warm days are evident for autumn,
   while increases of 0.07\% days year(-1) are calculated for summer. A
   general increasing trend in heatwave events is recorded at 0.03 events
   year(-1) countrywide.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the study of the upper atmosphere is increasing, mostly
   because of the need to understand the patterns of Earth's atmosphere.
   Since studies on global warming have become very important for the
   development of new technologies, understanding all regions of the
   atmosphere becomes an unavoidable task. In this paper, we aim to analyze
   the temperature variability and its trend in the mesosphere and lower
   thermosphere (MLT) region during a period of 12 years (from 2003 to
   2014). For this purpose, three different heights, i.e., 85, 90 and 95
   km, were focused on in order to investigate the upper atmosphere, and a
   geographic region different to other studies was chosen, in the southern
   region of Brazil, centered in the city of Santa Maria, RS (29 degrees
   4'02 `' S; 53 degrees 48'25 `' W). In order to reach the objectives of
   this work, temperature data from the SABER instrument (Sounding of the
   Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry), aboard NASA's
   Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED)
   satellite, were used. Finally, two cases were studied related to
   distinct grids of latitude/longitude used to obtain the mean temperature
   profiles. The first case considered a grid of 20 degrees x 20 degrees
   lat/long, centered in Santa Maria, RS, Brazil. In the second case, the
   region was reduced to a size of 15 degrees x 15 degrees in order to
   compare the results and discuss the two cases in terms of differences or
   similarities in temperature trends. Observations show that the size of
   the geographical area used for the average temperature profiles can
   influence the results of variability and trend of the temperature. In
   addition, reducing the time duration of analyses from 24 to 12 h a day
   also influences the trend significantly. For the smaller ge-ographical
   region (15 degrees x 15 degrees) and the 12 h daily time window
   (09:00-21:00 UT) it was found that the main contributions for the
   temperature variability at the three heights were the annual and
   semi-annual cycles and the solar flux influence. A smaller trend (-0.02
   +/- 0.16\% decade(-1)) was found at 90 km height and small positive
   trends (0.58 +/- 0.26\% and 0.41 +/- 0.19\% decade(-1)) were found at
   altitudes of 85 and 95 km, respectively..},

Pages = {5709-5719},

Abstract = {We explore the extent to which internal variability can reconcile
   discrepancies between observed and simulated warming in the upper
   tropical troposphere. We compare all extant radiosonde-based estimates
   for the period 1958-2014 to simulations from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project phase 5 multimodel ensemble and the 100
   realization Max Planck Institute large ensemble. We consider annual mean
   temperatures and all available 30-and 15-year trends. Most observed
   trends fall within the ensemble spread for most of the record, and
   trends calculated over 15-year periods show better agreement than
   30-year trends, with generally larger discrepancies for the older
   observational products. The simulated amplification of surface warming
   aloft in the troposphere is consistent with observations, and the linear
   correlation between surface and simultaneous tropospheric warming trends
   decreases with trend length. We conclude that trend differences between
   observations and simulations of tropical tropospheric temperatures are
   dominated by observational uncertainty and chaotic internal variability
   rather than by systematic errors in model performance.},

Abstract = {Subject of this paper is analysis of mean, absolute maximum and absolute
   minimum air temperatures (on a monthly and annual scale) in order to
   represent certain climatic characteristics of Sumadija region (Serbia).
   Data from 10 meteorological stations located in this region were used in
   the analysis for the period 1961-2010. Based on available data it is
   concluded that similar climate conditions are met in the whole region
   and the spatial variations of air temperatures are relatively small.
   Mean annual air temperatures varied from 11-11.6 degrees. in most of
   meteorological stations. The only exception is Belgrade where slightly
   higher mean annual air temperature of 12.3 degrees. was calculated,
   which along with micro-location influence of this station indicates the
   presence of urban heat island effect. In order to determine potential
   air temperature changes in Sumadija region, the trends of the climatic
   element are examined using Mann-Kendall test and Sens slope estimation.
   Calculated trends of mean annual air temperatures indicate increase in
   almost all stations and they are statistically significant on the
   confidence levels from 95 to 99.9\%. Contrary to the trends of mean
   annual air temperatures, absolute maximum air temperature trends have
   statistically significant increase only in six stations (at four
   stations confidence level is 99\%, and 95\% at one station and 90\% at
   another one). Other four stations do not have statistically significant
   trends of absolute maximum air temperatures. Absolute minimum air
   temperatures do not have statistically significant trends.},

Title = {Global climate models' bias in surface temperature trends and
   variability},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Earth has warmed in the last century with the most rapid warming
   occurring near the surface in the Arctic. This Arctic amplification
   occurs partly because the extra heat is trapped in a thin layer of air
   near the surface due to the persistent stable-stratification found in
   this region. The amount of warming depends upon the extent of turbulent
   mixing in the atmosphere, which is described by the depth of the
   atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Global climate models (GCMs) tend to
   over-estimate the depth of stably-stratified ABLs, and here we show that
   GCM biases in the ABL depth are strongly correlated with biases in the
   surface temperature variability. This highlights the need for a better
   description of the stably-stratified ABL in GCMs in order to constrain
   the current uncertainty in climate variability and projections of
   climate change in the surface layer.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases are expected on
   theoretical grounds to lead to a cooling of the upper atmosphere. Due to
   the close thermal coupling of the neutral and ionized components of the
   upper atmosphere the effects of this cooling are also expected to be
   seen in the ionospheric ion temperature. Long-term satellite
   observations of neutral density show a trend consistent with the
   expected cooling. Temperature data from the Millstone Hill incoherent
   scatter radar ( 46.2 degrees N, 288.5 degrees E) from 1978 to 2007 have
   been analyzed to provide a direct estimate of the temperature trend
   above the radar. The long-term trend in the directly measured ion
   temperature T-i at 375 km is found to be -4.7 K/ year with a 95\%
   confidence interval of -3.6 to -5.8 K. The estimated trend in the
   neutral temperature T-n is -5.0 K/ year. These are significantly larger
   than predicted by theory.},

Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {277-292},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A number of indices have been developed to investigate recent changes in
   the annual frequencies of extreme temperature events in Australia. A
   high-quality daily temperature dataset including 88 station records is
   used to determine trends in these indices, generally over the period
   1957 to 1996. Indices investigated include measures of the frequencies
   of daily maximum and minimum temperatures above and below fixed
   temperature thresholds, as well as frequencies above and below specified
   percentile levels. Trends in consecutive days and nights of extreme
   temperature are also considered. These trends indicate that occurrences
   of warm temperature extreme events have generally increased over the
   investigation period, whilst numbers of extremely cool temperature
   events have decreased. The trends are particularly strong for indices
   based on minimum temperature, with many statistically significant at the
   95 per cent confidence level. Some of the trends display considerable
   regional variation. Examples of this are a downward trend in the
   frequency of warm extremes in parts of the far southeast, counter to the
   national trend, and an especially strong decrease in the frequency of
   relatively cool days along the east coast. A number of measures of daily
   temperature variability are also examined with many records showing
   significant declines for these indices. These trends may provide the
   first evidence of decreases in intraseasonal temperature variability
   consistent with those observed over large parts of the northern
   hemisphere landmass.},

Abstract = {We analyse data from weekly rocket temperature soundings up to 75 km
   carried out since mid - 1960s at polar (Heiss Island 80.6 degrees N and
   Molodezhnaya, 67.7 degrees S), temperate (Volgograd, 48.7 degrees N and
   Balkhash, 46.8 degrees N) and tropical (Thumba, 8.5 degrees N)
   latitudes. All records show significant cooling which is of the order of
   a few degrees K at 30-40 km, 10 K at 50 km and 20 K at 60-70 km. In the
   mesosphere the temperature trends are estimated from the hydroxyl
   rotational temperature records which start in 1957 at Zvenigorod (55.7
   degrees N) and Abastumani (41.8 degrees N). These are related to the
   mesopause at 87 km and also show a cooling of about 30 K during the
   time. The cooling is qualitatively consistent with increasing
   concentration of greenhouse gases but may also reflect the changing
   chemistry of stratosphere and mesosphere, which is clearly seen in
   increasing emission intensities of hydroxyl during the lab decades.
   Therefore the stratosphere and mesosphere may be regions with the
   strongest signals of global change.},

Title = {Interpretation of interdecadal trends in Northern Hemisphere surface air
   temperature},

Abstract = {Monthly mean time series of 1) surface air temperature anomalies
   averaged over the Northern Hemisphere based on data from land stations,
   2) sea surface temperature anomalies averaged over the Northern
   Hemisphere oceans, and 3) 1000-500-mb thickness anomalies averaged over
   the region poleward of 40 degrees N are examined. The data are
   stratified in terms of warm (May-October) and cold (November-April)
   seasons. Time series 1) and 3) based on cold-season data exhibit much
   larger month to month variability and a richer spectrum of interannual
   variability than those based on warm-season data: the interdecadal to
   century scale variability stands out more clearly in the warm-season
   time series. Cold- and warm-season time series for i) differ
   substantially, even when heavily smoothed.
   It is hypothesized that the richer spectrum of variability in the
   cold-season time series is dynamically induced. To test this hypothesis,
   departures of cold-season data for 1) and 3) from their respective
   smoothed warm-season time series are regressed upon the hemispheric
   1000-500-mb thickness field. Anomalously warm cold-season months are
   shown to be characterized by circulation regimes conducive to positive
   thickness anomalies over the high-latitude continents. A simple index of
   this distinctive `'cold ocean-warm land'' (COWL) pattern accounts for
   65\% of the variance of 1) during the cold-season months and for most of
   the discrepancies between its 5-yr running mean cold- and warm-season
   time series. The anomalous warmth of the winters of the 1980s is
   consistent with the strong positive bias of the COWL pattern index
   during the cold seasons of that decade.},

Title = {Trends of Changes in Minimum Lake Water Temperature in Poland},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Water temperature in lakes is their basic property that determines many
   processes. Changes in average values are thoroughly investigated using a
   long-term approach. Knowledge of extreme situations such as temperature
   minimums is still insufficient. This paper analyses changes in the
   minimum temperature in 10 lakes in Poland in the period 1972-2021. The
   obtained results show variability over the course of the parameter, both
   at the annual and monthly scale. In the first case, half of the analysed
   set showed statistically significant increasing trends (on average 0.10
   degrees C per decade). In the latter case, the greatest changes occurred
   in the months of the warm half-year (on average 0.57 degrees C per
   decade). The reported situation is caused by the individual conditions
   of particular lakes, i.e., their location, morphometric parameters, or
   the dynamics of the occurrence of ice phenomena. A successive increase
   in the minimum temperature in lakes has its consequences for biotic and
   abiotic processes. Exceeding specific thresholds results in the evident
   transformation of these ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The long-term trends in temperature over Iran were examined over 34
   synoptic stations during a 50 year period (1961-2010) on seasonal and
   annual time scales. Two methods, a modified version of the Mann-Kendall
   test by eliminating the effect of all significant autocorrelation
   co-efficients and the regional Kendall test, were used in trend
   identification. The results revealed that the temperature had
   experienced significant positive trends in autumn, spring and especially
   summer over the study area. On an annual time scale and in the winter,
   the highest increasing trends were observed at stations located in the
   southern and southeastern parts of Iran. For regional analysis of
   trends, the stations were divided into five clusters based on the
   K-means clustering method and the silhouette index. Subsequently, the
   regional trend of temperature was analysed on seasonal and annual time
   scales using the regional Kendall test. The results of the regional
   Kendall test also indicated the rising trends in temperature during the
   last 50 years throughout the country on both seasonal and annual time
   scales. After verifying the presence of an increasing trend in the
   temperature time series, the non-parametric Pettitt test was used to
   detect the change points in the annual and seasonal time scales. The
   results showed that the change point of average temperature began from
   the summer of 1972 (Sabzevar station) and continued until the summer of
   1998 (Zahedan station). The most frequent change point occurrence was
   between the years 1986 and 1994.},

Abstract = {This study analyses trends of mean (T (m)), maximum (T (x)), minimum (T
   (n)), dew point (T (d)), and wet-bulb temperatures (T (w)) on an annual,
   seasonal, and monthly time scale over Spain during the period 1981-2010.
   The main purpose was to determine how temperature and humidity changes
   are impacting on T (w), which is probably a better measure of climate
   change than temperature alone. In this study, 43 weather stations were
   used to detect data trends using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and
   the Sen method to estimate the slope of trends. Significant linear
   trends observed for T (m), T (x), and T (n) versus year were 56, 58, and
   47 \% of the weather stations, respectively, with temperature ranges
   between 0.2 and 0.4 A degrees C per decade. The months with bigger
   trends were April, May, June, and July with the highest trend for T (x).
   The spatial behaviour of T (d) and T (w) was variable, with various
   locations showing trends from -0.6 to +0.3 A degrees C per decade for T
   (d) and from -0.4 to +0.5 A degrees C per decade for T (w). Both T (d)
   and T (w) showed negative trends for July, August, September, November,
   and December. Comparing the trends versus time of each variable versus
   each of the other variables exhibited poor relationships, which means
   you cannot predict the trend of one variable from the trend of another
   variable. The trend of T (x) was not related to the trend of T (n). The
   trends of T (x), T (m), and T (n) versus time were unrelated to the
   trends versus time of either T (d) or T (w). The trend of T (w) showed a
   high coefficient of determination with the trend of T (d) with an annual
   value of R (2) = 0.86. Therefore, the T (w) trend is more related to
   changes in humidity than temperature.},

Abstract = {We compare observed decadal trends in global mean surface temperature
   with those predicted using a modelling system that encompasses observed
   initial condition information, externally forced response (due to
   anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosol precursors), and internally
   generated variability. We consider retrospective decadal forecasts for
   nine cases, initiated at five year intervals, with the first beginning
   in 1961 and the last in 2001. Forecast ensembles of size thirty are
   generated from differing but similar initial conditions. We concentrate
   on the trends that remain after removing the following natural signals
   in observations and hindcasts: dynamically induced atmospheric
   variability, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the effects of
   explosive volcanic eruptions. We show that ensemble mean errors in the
   decadal trend hindcasts are smaller than in a parallel set of
   uninitialized free running climate simulations. The ENSO signal, which
   is skillfully predicted out to a year or so, has little impact on our
   decadal trend predictions, and our modelling system possesses skill,
   independent of ENSO, in predicting decadal trends in globalmean surface
   temperature. Citation: Fyfe, J. C., W. J. Merryfield, V. Kharin, G. J.

Abstract = {Purpose: To identify trends in preterm delivery (PTD) as well as
   seasonality, temporal variation and the effect of heat stress on its
   incidence.Materials and methods: In this retrospective population-based
   study, we included all deliveries taking place at the Soroka University
   Medical Center between the years 1988-2012. A time series database was
   built including meteorological factors and the number of spontaneous
   versus induced PTDs for each day. Data were analyzed using time-series
   analyses.Results: During the study period, 263 709 deliveries occurred,
   7.9\% of which were preterm. Spontaneous PTD rate steadily decreased,
   while induced PTD rate increased. A significant annual and seasonal
   variation was noted in PTD incidence. A significant higher incidence of
   spontaneous PTD was demonstrated during the summer period with an
   incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 4.1 (95\%CI: 3.1-5.5; p<0.001). This trend
   was not significant for induced PTD. A significant linear association
   was noted between the heat-stress index and the rates of spontaneous
   (IRR=1.07, 95\%CI: 1.05-1.10; p<0.001) but not induced PTDs.Conclusions:
   Spontaneous PTD is more common during the summer and its rate is
   declining steadily over the past decades. Increased outdoor temperature
   has a significant effect on the incidence of spontaneous, but not
   induced, PTD.},

   This paper employs a novel trend extraction method based on multi-scale

   approach is model-free, adaptive, fast, flexible and free of
   sifting-process applied in empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The
   practical temperature data series is analyzed and the changing trend can
   be extracted as fast as possible. In addition, the comparison with other
   methods based EMD is also presented to show the advantages of the
   proposed method in application of trend extraction and analysis for

Abstract = {This study examines the seasonality of tropical lower-stratospheric
   temperature trends using the Microwave Sounding Unit lower-stratospheric
   channel (T-4) for 1980-2008. We present evidence that this seasonality
   is largely a response to changes in the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC)
   driven by extratropical wave forcing. We show how the tropical T-4 trend
   can be used as an indicator of changes in the BDC, and find that the BDC
   is strengthening for 1980-2008 in June-November related to the Southern
   Hemisphere (SH) and in December-February to the Northern Hemisphere
   (NH). In marked contrast, we find that the BDC is weakening in
   March-May, apparently because of a weakening of its northern cell. The
   novel observational evidence on the seasonal dependence of the BDC
   trends presented in this study has important implications for the
   understanding of climate change in the stratosphere as well as testing
   climate model simulations.},

   indicate an increase in the LST over this period. The daily minimum has
   risen faster than the daily maximum, resulting in a narrowing of the
   diurnal range of LST. This is in agreement with the observed trends in
   both global and plateau near-surface air temperature. Since the
   near-surface air temperature is mainly controlled by LST, this result
   ensures a warming trend in near-surface air temperature.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the recent extreme temperature trends across 19
   stations in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, over the period 2006-16.
   Fourteen extreme index trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall
   non-parametric test, with Sen's slope as a magnitude estimator.
   Generally, the annual daily mean temperature, daily mean maximum
   temperature, and daily mean minimum temperature in the Klang Valley
   increased significantly, by 0.07 degrees C yr(-1), 0.07 degrees C yr(-1)
   and 0.08 degrees C yr(-1), respectively. For the warm temperature
   indices, the results indicated a significant upward trend for the annual
   maximum of maximum temperature, by 0.09 degrees C yr(-1), and the annual
   maximum of minimum temperature, by 0.11 degrees C yr(-1). The results
   for the total number of warm days and warm nights showed significant
   increasing trends of 5.02 d yr(-1) and 6.92 d yr(-1), respectively. For
   the cold temperature indices, there were upward trends for the annual
   minimum of maximum temperature, by 0.09 degrees C yr(-1), and the annual
   minimum of minimum temperature, by 0.03 degrees C yr(-1), concurrent
   with the decreases in the total number cold days (TX10P), with -3.80 d
   yr(-1), and cold nights (TN10P), with -4.33 d yr(-1). The 34 degrees C
   and 37 degrees C summer days results showed significant upward trends of
   4.10 d yr(-1) and 0.25 d yr(-1), respectively. Overall, these findings
   showed upward warming trends in the Klang Valley, with the minimum
   temperature rate increasing more than that of the maximum temperature,
   especially in urban areas. ? ????????????? 19 ?????, ?????? 2006-2016

Abstract = {The Earth has warmed at an unprecedented pace in the decades of the
   1980s and 1990s (IPCC in Climate change 2007: the scientific basis,
   Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2007). In Wu et al. (Proc Natl
   Acad Sci USA 104:14889-14894, 2007) we showed that the rapidity of the
   warming in the late twentieth century was a result of concurrence of a
   secular warming trend and the warming phase of a multidecadal (similar
   to 65-year period) oscillatory variation and we estimated the
   contribution of the former to be about 0.08A degrees C per decade since
   similar to 1980. Here we demonstrate the robustness of those results and
   discuss their physical links, considering in particular the shape of the
   secular trend and the spatial patterns associated with the secular trend
   and the multidecadal variability. The shape of the secular trend and
   rather globally-uniform spatial pattern associated with it are both
   suggestive of a response to the buildup of well-mixed greenhouse gases.
   In contrast, the multidecadal variability tends to be concentrated over
   the extratropical Northern Hemisphere and particularly over the North
   Atlantic, suggestive of a possible link to low frequency variations in
   the strength of the thermohaline circulation. Depending upon the assumed
   importance of the contributions of ocean dynamics and the time-varying
   aerosol emissions to the observed trends in global-mean surface
   temperature, we estimate that up to one third of the late twentieth
   century warming could have been a consequence of natural variability.},

Abstract = {The mesosphere is gradually gaining importance under the new concept of
   global change debate in recent time. The analysis of systematic changes
   and trends in the temperature of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere
   (MLT) has not been as comprehensive as in the lower part of the
   atmosphere. The reported results on temperature trends in this region
   are diverse and not much effort was made until recently to synthesize
   these results to present a global picture. It appears that the
   understanding of several sources of uncertainties, their bias
   characteristics and subsequent corrections are the key for correct
   attribution of mesospheric temperature trend from the existing data
   sets. The interactive model study is essential component to enhance our
   knowledge in understanding the observed features in the vertical
   distribution of trends. This article briefly describes some important
   factors of errors, which are likely to contaminate the observed data and
   play a major role in temperature trend analysis. It also summarizes the
   similarities and differences in various results on temperature trend for
   MLT region obtained by both experimental and model studies. (C) 2002

Title = {A Temperature Trend for Clouds and Hazes in Exoplanet Atmospheres},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {941},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres observed with the
   Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the near-infrared range (1.1-1.65 mu m)
   frequently show evidence for some combination of clouds and hazes.
   Identification of systematic trends in exoplanet clouds and hazes is
   potentially important for understanding atmospheric composition and
   temperature structure. Here we report on the analysis of spectral
   modulation using a large, uniformly processed sample of HST/WFC3 transit
   spectra from 62 exoplanets. The spectral retrieval includes the
   capability to detect and represent atmospheres in which the composition
   departs from thermochemical equilibrium. By using this unique catalog
   and measuring the dampening of spectral modulations compared to strictly
   clear atmospheres, we identify two populations. One is completely
   cloud/haze free spanning a wide temperature range, while the other
   population, identified as partial cloud/hazes, follows a trend from
   mostly cloudy/hazy around 500 K to mostly clear at similar to 1500 K. We
   also find that a partially transparent aerosol component is frequently
   present and that it is typically vertically distributed throughout the
   atmospheric column. Our findings also suggest that while clouds and
   hazes are common in exoplanet atmospheres, the majority of planets have
   some level of detectable spectral modulation. Additionally, the
   empirical trend that clouds and hazes are minimized at 1460.86
   K-+405(-316) revealed in our catalog has predictive utility for modeling
   the performance of large-scale transiting exoplanets survey, such as
   planned with the Ariel mission. This trend can also be used for making a
   probability-based forecast of spectral modulation for a given source in
   the context of future JWST observations. Future observations including
   the optical and/or a broader spectral coverage may be useful to further
   quantify the trend reported here.},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is affected by surface-atmosphere
   interaction. Yet, the degree to which surface and atmospheric factors
   impact the magnitude of LST trend is not well established. Here, we used
   surface energy balance, boosted regression tree model, and satellite
   observation and reanalysis data to unravel the effects of surface
   factors (albedo, sensible heat, latent heat, and ground heat) as well as
   incoming radiation (shortwave and longwave) on LST trends in East Africa
   (EA). Our result showed that 11\% of EA was affected by significant (p <
   0.05) daytime annual LST trends, which exhibited both cooling of -0.19 K
   year(-1) (mainly in South Sudan and Sudan) and warming of 0.22 K
   year(-1) (mainly in Somalia and Kenya). The nighttime LST trends
   affected a large part of EA (31\%) and were dominated by significant
   warming trend (0.06 K year(-1)). Influenced by contrasting daytime and
   nighttime LST trends, the diurnal LST range reduced in 15\% of EA. The
   modeling result showed that latent heat flux (32\%), incoming longwave
   radiation (30\%), and shortwave radiation (23\%) were stronger in
   explaining daytime LST trend. The effects of surface factors were
   stronger in both cooling and warming trends, whereas atmospheric factors
   had stronger control only on surface cooling trends. These results
   indicate the differential control of surface and atmospheric factors on
   warming and cooling trends, highlighting the importance of considering
   both factors for accurate evaluation of the LST trends in the future.},

Title = {Accuracy assessment of temperature trends from ERA5 and ERA5-Land},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {856},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Many environmental processes and ecological systems are being affected
   by the warming temperatures as a result of climate change. To correctly
   identify and attribute the uncertainty estimates in these systems, an
   investigation of tem-perature trend signal existing in the datasets that
   are used to study such systems is necessary. In this study, the trend of
   widely used ERA5 and ERA5-Land temperature estimates between 1951 and
   2020 were validated using temperature trends from ground station-based
   observations in Turkey. The investigation included datasets obtained
   over 540 stations, and the seasonality and spatio-temporal variability
   of the trend accuracy was also investigated. On average, the trends of
   observations over all stations were 0.82 degrees C/decade and 0.30
   degrees C/decade for the periods 2001-2020 and 1951-2020, respectively,
   indicating strong evidence of climate change. When the model datasets
   used spatially and temporally continuous datasets, the trends identified
   were 0.91 degrees C/decade and 0.21 degrees C/decade over the entire
   Turkey for the years 2001-2020 and 1951-2020, respectively. The
   difference in the 70-year trends of the two esti-mates was attributed to
   the missing datasets in observations. The differences between the trends
   of model estimates and observations were higher for the first decade
   than for the last two decades, stressing the impact of improved model
   estimates over time. All products showed heavy seasonality, suggesting
   that winter trends (1.3 degrees C/decade on average) are much higher
   than the summer (0.3 degrees C/decade) between 2001 and 2020. The
   results indicated a high degree of consistency between the trends of
   ERA5/ERA5-Land and observations, implying they may be used as a
   replacement to observations.},

Abstract = {The intensification of global warming leads to the increased frequency
   of extreme temperature events. Many studies have reported on numerous
   regions facing extreme hot and cold temperatures to some degree. In this
   study, the daily maximum, minimum and mean near-surface air temperatures
   were estimated to explore the detailed spatial trends of extreme
   temperature events along the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Transportation
   Corridor (QTPTC). Sixteen extreme temperature indices were used to
   represent extreme temperature events, and the Mann-Kendall trend test
   and Sen's slope estimation method were employed to explore the
   spatiotemporal trends of extreme temperatures along the QTPTC during
   1981-2019. The possible factors that affect the trends of extreme
   temperature events were also discussed, indicating that: (a) There was
   an exacerbation of extreme hot events, while the prevalence of extreme
   cold events weakened along the QTPTC. This was in accordance with the
   trend of global warming. (b) The trends of extreme temperature indices
   based on daily minimum temperature were stronger than those based on
   daily maximum temperature in most areas, except for the eastern region.
   Furthermore, as altitude increased, the amplitude of warming
   intensified. (c) Unlike the trend in most areas, the intensified warming
   trend occurred in the low-altitude areas in the eastern region where
   there are more human activities and rapid urbanization, and the daily
   maximum temperature trend was more severe there. The results can provide
   references for policymakers to formulate corresponding adaptation
   strategies, addressing the impacts of extreme temperature events on
   transportation facilities with significant elevation differences.},

Title = {Recent trends of extreme temperature indices for the Iberian Peninsula},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {66-76},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change and extreme climate events have a significant impact on
   societies and ecosystems. As a result, climate change projections,
   especially related with extreme temperature events, have gained
   increasing importance due to their impacts on the well-being of the
   population and ecosystems. However, most studies in the field are based
   on coarse global climate models (GCMs). In this study, we perform a high
   resolution downscaling simulation to evaluate recent trends of extreme
   temperature indices. The model used was Weather Research and Forecast
   (WRF) forced by MPI-ESM-LR, which has been shown to be one of the more
   robust models to simulate European climate. The domain used in the
   simulations includes the Iberian Peninsula and the simulation covers the
   1986-2005 period (i.e. recent past). In order to study extreme
   temperature events, trends were computed using the Theil-Sen method for
   a set of temperature indexes defined by the Expert Team on Climate
   Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). For this, daily values of minimum
   and maximum temperatures were used. The trends of the indexes were
   computed for annual and seasonal values and the Mann-Kendall Trend test
   was used to evaluate their statistical significance. In order to
   validate the results, a second simulation, in which WRF was forced by
   ERA-Interim, was performed. The results suggest an increase in the
   number of warm days and warm nights, especially during summer and
   negative trends for cold nights and cold days for the summer and spring.
   For the winter, contrary to the expected, the results suggest an
   increase in cold days and cold nights (warming hiatus). This behavior is
   supported by the WRF simulation forced by ERA-Interim for the autumn
   days, pointing to an extension of the warming hiatus phenomenon to the
   remaining seasons. These results should be used with caution since the
   period used to calculate the trends may not be long enough for this
   purpose. However, the general sign of trends are similar for both
   simulations despite some differences in their magnitudes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Long-term temporal trends in water temperature in rivers and streams are
   typically estimated under the assumption of evenly-spaced space-time
   measurements. However, sampling times and dates associated with
   historical water temperature datasets and some sampling designs may be
   haphazard. As a result, trends in temperature may be confounded with
   trends in time or space of sampling which, in turn, may yield biased
   trend estimators and thus unreliable conclusions. We address this
   concern using multilevel (hierarchical) linear models, where time
   effects are allowed to vary randomly by day and date effects by year. We
   evaluate the proposed approach by Monte Carlo simulations with
   imbalance, sparse data and confounding by trend in time and date of
   sampling. Simulation results indicate unbiased trend estimators while
   results from a case study of temperature data from the Illinois River,
   USA conform to river thermal assumptions. We also propose a new
   nonparametric bootstrap inference on multilevel models that allows for a
   relatively flexible and distribution-free quantification of
   uncertainties. The proposed multilevel modeling approach may be
   elaborated to accommodate nonlinearities within days and years when
   sampling times or dates typically span temperature extremes.},

Abstract = {The spring season in Korea features a dynamic landscape with a variety
   of flowers blooming sequentially one after another. This enables local
   governments to earn substantial sightseeing revenues by hosting
   festivals featuring spring flowers. Furthermore, beekeepers move from
   the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula all the way northward in a
   quest to secure spring flowers as nectar sources for a sustained period
   of time. However, areal differences in flowering dates of flower species
   are narrowing, which has economic consequences. Analysis of data on
   flowering dates of forsythia (Forsythia koreana) and cherry blossom
   (Prunus serrulata), two typical spring flower species, as observed for
   the past 60 years at six weather stations of the Korea Meteorological
   Administration (KMA) indicated that the difference between the flowering
   date of forsythia, the earliest blooming flower in spring, and cherry
   blossom, which flowers later than forsythia, was 14 days on average in
   the climatological normal year for the period 1951-1980, compared with
   11 days for the period 1981-2010. In 2014, the gap narrowed further to 7
   days, making it possible in some locations to see forsythias and cherry
   blossoms blooming at the same time. Synchronized flowering of these two
   flower species is due to acceleration of flowering due to an abnormally
   high spring temperature, and this was more pronounced in the
   later-blooming cherry blossom than forsythia. While cherry blossom
   flowering dates across the nation ranged from March 31 to April 19 (an
   areal difference of 20 days) for the 1951-1980 normal year, the
   difference ranged from March 29 to April 12 (an areal difference of 16
   days) for the 1981-2010 normal year, and in 2014, the flowering dates
   spanned March 25 and March 30 (an areal difference of 6 days). In the
   case of forsythia, the gap was narrower than in cherry blossoms. Climate
   change in the Korean Peninsula, reflected by rapid temperature hikes in
   late spring in contrast to a slow temperature rise in early spring
   immediately after dormancy release, likely brought forward the flowering
   date of cherry blossom. We derived a thermal time-based flowering model
   from this analysis and used it to predict the flowering dates of
   forsythia and cherry blossom in 2014. The root mean square error for the
   prediction was within 2 days from the observed flowering dates in both
   species, showing a feasibility of prediction under the changing climate.},

Abstract = {An analysis of 80-year shelter level temperature records at 112
   California sites has been carried out. Results show that sea surface
   temperature (SST) and urban heat island effects influence the magnitude
   of the observed warming trend in the overall data set. These effects,
   however, are masked by averaging all temperature records together.
   While a warming trend existed in the overall data set, areas with such
   trends generally corresponded to areas containing the state's major
   population centers. Warming trend magnitude also increased with county
   population size, and 20 small inland towns and rural areas actually
   showed cooling trends.
   SST trends over the last 40 years showed cooling in mid-ocean areas and
   an anomalous warming at coastal sites. The warming was associated with a
   decline in the normal frequency of cold water upwelling in the coastal
   area. SST warming was found to be highly correlated with the warming of
   shelter level temperatures at coastal land observation sites.},

Abstract = {The study investigates trends in extreme temperature indices in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina. A collection of daily minimum and maximum temperature
   time series from four meteorological stations was selected for the
   calculation of 18 indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate
   Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). Trends in warm and cold extreme
   temperature indices during 19612015 periods were calculated using the
   RClimDex (1.0) software. Given the results, the significant warming
   trend is present all over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Tmax and Tmin exhibit
   a warming tendency during the observed period. Warm temperature extremes
   significantly increased, whereas cold temperature extremes showed a
   downward trend. In general, the warm temperature indices show stronger
   warming trends than those negative associated with cold temperature
   indices. The highest trend values were obtained for the increase in
   frequency and intensity of warm temperature extremes: TXx, TNn, TN90p,
   TX90p, WSDI, SU and TR30. The warming trend was most prominent in
   summer, then in winter and spring. A significant positive/negative
   correlation between East-Atlantic pattern and warm/cold temperature
   indices was determined over the entire territory of Bosnia and
   Herzegovina throughout the year. Winter and spring extreme temperature
   indices were also significantly related to the North Atlantic
   Oscillation index and Arctic Oscillation index, respectively.},

Abstract = {Our study area is one of the semiarid region of the China with under
   water stress condition that causes economic damage. The main objective
   of this study is to apply standardized precipitation evapotranspiration
   index (SPEI) and to use linear regression to calculate drought
   conditions in the study area. For this purpose, data from 1980 to 2010
   was analyzed at different (1, 6, 12, and 24 months) time scales. Results
   depicted both dry and wet periods in the study area; occurrence of dry
   span with different frequency and magnitude was increased over last
   decades (2000-2010) at most of the stations. Statistical results
   demonstrated that temperature was decreased in the 1st decade in most of
   stations but in two decades from 1990 to 2000 and 2001 to 2010,
   temperature was increased except in Changzhi station. These results
   could be a future reference for developing information programs about
   monitoring and early drought information, planning of existing
   reservoirs, and management of water resources under climate conditions.},

   of cold and warm temperature extremes at many locations in Europe. At
   some locations the range of extreme cold and hot temperatures increases,

   cold events (ECE). How the frequency and duration of both EHE and ECE
   have changed over time within both terrestrial and marine environments
   globally has not been fully explored. Here, we use detrended daily
   estimates of minimum and maximum temperature from the ERA5 reanalysis
   over a 70-year period (1950-2019) to estimate the daily occurrence of
   EHE and ECE across the globe. We measure the frequency and duration of
   EHE and ECE by season across years and estimate how these measures have
   changed over time. Frequency and duration for both EHE and ECE presented
   similar patterns characterized by low spatial heterogeneity and strong
   seasonal variation. High EHE frequency and duration occurred within the
   Antarctic during the austral summer and winter and within the Arctic
   Ocean during the boreal winter. High ECE frequency and duration occurred
   within the Nearctic and Palearctic during the boreal winter and the
   Arctic Ocean during the boreal summer. The trend analysis presented
   pronounced differences between frequency and duration, high spatial
   heterogeneity, especially within terrestrial environments, and strong
   seasonal variation. Positive EHE trends, primarily in duration within
   marine environments, occurred during the boreal summer within the
   mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and during the austral summer
   within the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. The eastern
   tropical Pacific contained positive EHE and ECE trends, primary in
   duration during the boreal winter. Our findings emphasize the many
   near-term challenges that extreme temperature events are likely to pose
   for human and natural systems within terrestrial and marine
   environments, and the need to advance our understanding of the
   developing long-term implications of these changing dynamics as climate
   change progresses.},

Abstract = {Monthly Mean surface air temperature at 23 stations in Iraq were
   analyzed for temporal trends and spatial variation during 1980-2015.
   Seasonal and annual temperature was analyzed using Mann-Kendall test to
   detect the significant trend. The results of temporal analysis showed
   that during winter, spring, summer and Autumn have a positive trend in
   all the parts of Iraq. A tendency has also been observed towards warmer
   years, with significantly warmer summer and spring periods and slightly
   warmer autumn and winter, the highest increase is (3.5)degrees C in
   Basrah during the summer. The results of spatial analyze using the
   ArcGIS showed that the seasonal temperature can be divided into two or
   three distinct areas with high temperature in the south and decreasing
   towards north, where the trend of spatial temperature were decreasing
   from south to the north in all the four seasons.},

Title = {Stratospheric temperature trends: impact of ozone variability and the

Abstract = {In most climate simulations used by the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change 2007 fourth assessment report, stratospheric processes
   are only poorly represented. For example, climatological or simple
   specifications of time-varying ozone concentrations are imposed and the
   quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of equatorial stratospheric zonal wind
   is absent. Here we investigate the impact of an improved stratospheric
   representation using two sets of perturbed simulations with the Hadley
   Centre coupled ocean atmosphere model HadGEM1 with natural and
   anthropogenic forcings for the 1979-2003 period. In the first set of
   simulations, the usual zonal mean ozone climatology with superimposed
   trends is replaced with a time series of observed zonal mean ozone
   distributions that includes interannual variability associated with the
   solar cycle, QBO and volcanic eruptions. In addition to this, the second
   set of perturbed simulations includes a scheme in which the
   stratospheric zonal wind in the tropics is relaxed to appropriate zonal
   mean values obtained from the ERA-40 re-analysis, thus forcing a QBO.
   Both of these changes are applied strictly to the stratosphere only. The
   improved ozone field results in an improved simulation of the stepwise
   temperature transitions observed in the lower stratosphere in the
   aftermath of the two major recent volcanic eruptions. The contribution
   of the solar cycle signal in the ozone field to this improved
   representation of the stepwise cooling is discussed. The improved ozone
   field and also the QBO result in an improved simulation of observed
   trends, both globally and at tropical latitudes. The Eulerian upwelling
   in the lower stratosphere in the equatorial region is enhanced by the
   improved ozone field and is affected by the QBO relaxation, yet neither
   induces a significant change in the upwelling trend.},

Abstract = {This study discusses problems of the concept of normal period-based
   anomalies arising from climate variability and ongoing climate change.
   The widely used WMO 1961-1990 (61-90) standard normal period is compared
   to other consecutive 30-year normal periods in detail. Focus is given to
   the temperature distribution in Switzerland and on the European
   continent. In these regions, the temperature trend of the last decades
   led to an unusually high number of months with positive temperature
   anomalies relative to the WMO 61-90 standard normal period. Swiss
   anomalies based on the 61 -90 normal are up to 1.25 K higher than those
   based on the Latest 30-years Running Normal (LRN). The probability to
   observe a positive temperature anomaly with respect to the 61 -90 normal
   increased from 50\% to near 80\% for certain months of the year.
   Compared to the LRN, this change is statistically significant for 7 out
   of the 12 months on the 95\% level. The strongest signal can be found
   for the summer months, whereas temperatures in fall do not show any
   trends. Similar results are found for more than 90\% of the European
   continental area. For most regions, 2-5 are statistically inconsistent
   with the 61 -90 distribution. For southern France, parts of Spain and
   southern Scandinavia even 7-9 months are inconsistent. Copyright (C)

   for heights from 30 to 100 ion during 1955-1995 are the basis for

Abstract = {Obtaining the response of cloud top temperature (CTT) to global warming
   correctly is crucial for understanding the current and future energy
   budget of the climate system. For a given cloud fraction, colder CTT
   implies more longwave radiation being capped within the Earth-atmosphere
   system, consequently heating it. Current climate models predict an
   almost fixed CTT for upper-tropospheric clouds as the climate is
   expected to warm up during the 21st century, as explained by the fixed
   anvil temperature hypothesis. However, our analysis, based on the last
   19 years of satellite observations (12.2002-11.2021), reveals a
   significant decreasing trend in upper-tropospheric CTT with almost no
   change in the corresponding cloud fraction. This cooling rate is several
   times larger than the observed surface warming rate. This finding
   suggests a missing heating component by upper-tropospheric clouds in
   current climate predictions.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a pernicious and irrefutable reality. The objective of
   this work was to analyze trends in extreme temperature indices in
   Aguascalientes. With RClimdex 1.0 and data on daily maximum (T-max) and
   minimum temperature (T-min), 16 temperature indices were calculated. The
   trend in indices was determined with the non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test (p <= 0.05), while the rate of change was obtained with Theil-Sen's
   trend estimator. Significant positive trends were observed in 72 time
   series of indices associated withT(max)and in 39 time series of indices
   associated withT(min). Significant negative trends were observed in 22
   time series of indices associated withT(max), and in 45 time series of
   indices associated withT(min). In some regions of Aguascalientes,
   diurnal warming is occurring; in others, warmer or less cold nights
   prevail. The changes in extreme temperature indices might have severe
   implications in the use of irrigation water, cause physiological stress
   in crops, promote respiratory and cardiac diseases, and improve the
   reproduction cycles and populations of insects. Also, the fruit
   production, such as guava, could be affected under the reduction of
   minimum temperature, and the increase in warm days where other fruit
   trees are cultivated can intensify the use of chemical compensators of
   cold. These results are of significance for long-term economic planning
   and design of strategies of adaptation/mitigation to climate change. In
   Aguascalientes, the changes observed in extreme temperature indices
   could be due to climate change of a bigger scale, either regional or at
   the watershed level.},

Title = {Trends in Intra- and Inter-Annual Temperature Variabilities Across Sudan},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Four mean temperature variables, namely maximum (MAX), minimum (MIN),
   mean (MEAN) and diurnal temperature range (DTR), were considered for 14
   selected observational stations throughout Sudan. The objectives were to
   investigate the seasonal and annual regimes, the seasonal and annual
   trends, the intra-annual variability (IAV) by the coefficient of
   variation (CV), and the inter-relationships between the temperature
   variables and percent of possible sunshine. A mounting evidence of
   daytime and nighttime warming since the 1940s until 2005 is presented.
   The exception is the dry season which is dominated by daytime cooling
   attributable to the damping effect of dust haze/storms. Apparently, the
   progressive drought across inland locations has raised the MAXs, and to
   a lesser extent the MINs, of the wet season over those for the hot
   season. Accordingly, maximum rates of 0.451 and 0.336A degrees C
   decade(-1) were found for the nighttime and daytime temperatures,
   respectively. The extreme eastern and western locations have been
   frequently dominated by the warmest trend rates obtained nationwide. The
   prevalence of significant decreases (increases) of DTR is more apparent
   in the dry, hot and annual series (wet series). Depending on the
   temperature variable under consideration, many stations possessed
   significant trends toward either increased or decreased variability of
   the within-year monthly values, i.e. IAV. The correlation between the
   time series of annual CV and extreme values for each of the four
   temperature variables shows generally that warmer climate in Sudan is
   associated with higher intra-annual temperature variability and vise
   versa, i.e. the CV is directly correlated with the highest value within
   the year, but inversely correlated with the lowest one. The findings of
   this investigation also indicate that the DTR is directly related to
   percent of possible sunshine, but the relationship of the latter
   parameter is not so clear with MAX, MIN and MEAN.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on and analyses the potential hydrological impacts of
   climate change on the hydrologic regime of the Kelani River basin, Sri
   Lanka. In this research, future basin-wide hydrology is simulated by
   using downscaled temperature and precipitation outputs from the Canadian
   Earth System Model, version 2 (CanESM2), and the Hydrologic Engineering
   Centre's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). The research further
   evaluates the long-term behavior and trends of climate extremes based on
   observed historical temperature and precipitation data. The findings
   suggest that temperature and precipitation extremes are on the rise
   while the annual average precipitation in the basin is declining. It is
   also predicted with the application of statistical downscaling that
   temperature may rise annually for representative concentration pathways
   of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. A detailed modeling approach is applied
   to the Hanwella sub-watershed (1799.67km(2)) of the Kelani River basin
   to study subsequent water resource management options required to ensure
   the sustainable development alternatives with varying streamflow in the
   Kelani River basin under the effects of future (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s)
   rainfall and temperature as impending climate change becomes manifested.
   This paper reviews the current state of the catchment as well as the
   suitability of applying GCMs rather than RCMs to Sri Lanka to assess
   this river basin, according to monthly, seasonal, and annual variations
   of the climatology. Further, a quantitative analysis of the change of
   amount of surface water in the selected river basin with respect to the
   expected variations in precipitation and temperature is also carried
   out. The findings of this research and overall outcome will be useful in
   identifying possible climate change impact on paddy and crop production,
   ensuing sustainable water management scenarios, best management options,
   and mitigation measures in land use, carbon emission management, etc.,
   in a more meaningful manner in the future. This study will set the
   baseline for commencing and continuing quantitative studies
   incorporating the behavior of the basin-wide climatology and streamflow
   variability with the use of GCMs to achieve sustainable development
   goals.},

Abstract = {Precipitation plays a critical role in water resources management, and
   trend changes and alterations thereof are crucial to regional or basin
   water security, disaster prevention, and ecological restoration under a
   changing environment. In order to explore the implications of
   precipitation variation for water resources management, taking the Wei
   River Basin (a transitional zone between the Guanzhong Plain and Loess
   Plateau) as an example, this paper proposes an index system, namely the
   index of precipitation alteration (IPA), to evaluate changes in
   precipitation and investigate their potential influence on water
   resources management. The system includes 17 indicators gained from
   observed daily rainfall, involving some structural precipitation
   indicators describing the precipitation patterns and some functional
   precipitation indicators influencing utilization of watershed water
   resources. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical test is employed
   to identify the IPA trend change, and range of variability approach is
   used to evaluate the variation of IPA. The analysis results in Wei River
   Basin show that IPA varies with different spatial and temporal
   distributions. Overall, although the annual total precipitation declined
   in the study area, the frequency of extreme events was increased during
   1955-2012. In the face of severe climate change patterns, it is
   necessary to establish the precipitation index to evaluate the change of
   precipitation and to provide useful information for future precipitation
   assessments.},

   Trends over East Asia},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Droughts have become more severe and frequent due to global warming. In
   this context, it is widely accepted that for drought assessments, both
   water supply (rainfall) and demand (standardized precipitation
   evapotranspiration index, SPEI) should be considered. Using SPEI, we
   explored the spatial-temporal patterns of dry and wet annual and
   seasonal changes in five sub-regions of East Asia during 1902-2018.
   These factors are linked to excess drought frequency and severity on the
   regional scale, and their effect on vegetation remains an important
   topic for climate change studies. Our results show that the SPEI
   significantly improved extreme drought and mostly affected the SPEI-06
   and SPEI-12 growing seasons in East Asia during 1981-2018. The dry and
   wet annual SPEI trends mostly affect the five sub-regions of East Asia.
   The annual SPEI had two extremely dry spells during 1936-1947 and
   1978-2018. Japan, South Korea, and North Korea are wet in the summer
   compared to other regions of East Asia, with drought frequency occurring
   at 51.4\%, respectively. The mean drought frequencies in China and
   Mongolia are 57.4\% and 54.6\%. China and Mongolia are the driest
   regions in East Asia due to high drought frequency and duration. The
   spatial seasonal analysis of solar radiation (SR), water vapor pressure
   (WVP), wind speed (WS), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature
   condition index (TCI), and vegetation health index (VHI) have confirmed
   that the East Asia region suffered from maximum drought events. The
   seasonal variation of SPEI shows no clear drying trends during summer
   and autumn seasons. During the winter and spring seasons, there was a
   dry trend in East Asia region. During 1902-1990, a seasonal SPEI
   presented diverse characteristics, with clear wet trends in Japan,
   Mongolia, and North Korea in four different growing seasons, with dry
   trends in China and South Korea. During 1991-2018, seasonal SPEI
   presented clear dry trends in Japan, Mongolia, and North Korea in
   different growing seasons, while China and South Korea showed a wet
   trend during the spring, autumn, and winter seasons. This ecological and
   climatic mechanism provides a good basis for the assessment of
   vegetation and drought-change variations within East Asia. An
   understandings of long-term vegetation trends and the effects of
   rainfall and SPEI on droughts of varying severity is essential for water
   resource management and climate change adaptation. Based on the results,
   water resources will increase under global warming, which may alleviate
   the water scarcity issue in the East Asia region.},

Title = {Observed trends in the timing of wet and dry season in China and the

Abstract = {An understanding of the changes in precipitation timing, wet days (WD)
   and duration of extreme wet (dry) spells (WS/DS) is of great significant
   merit in the management of water resources and agricultural activities.
   In this study, the spatial features of trends in these precipitation
   characteristics over China during 1960-2013 were investigated. The
   timing of wet-/dry-season exhibited significant shift across the whole
   China. The timings of wet season showed significant delaying trends over
   the middle and lower Yangtze River basins and earlier onset trends over
   northern China, with the rate up to 1month per 50-years, which is partly
   due to the changes in East Asian summer monsoon circulation. Meanwhile,
   the timings of dry season over the middle and lower Yangtze River basins
   exhibited prominent earlier trends, combined with the delayed trends of
   wet season occurrence, resulted in a reduced transition period from wet
   season to dry season. Accompanying the pronounced shift of the
   occurrence time of wet-/dry-seasons, WD and duration of extreme WS/DS in
   wet-/dry-seasons also showed significant change. Predominantly negative
   trends of wet-season WD largely contributed to the deceasing annual WD
   in the regions east of 100 degrees E. The shortening of extreme
   dry-season DS was evident over Northeast China and lower Yangtze River;
   while the decrease of extreme wet-season WS was observed over the
   southern China, and these changes may help to reduce the corresponding
   risk of drought and flood, respectively. Southwest China showed robust
   less WD and prolonging DS on both annual and seasonal basis, and thus
   may enhance the risk of drought in this region.},

Abstract = {South Africa is susceptible to droughts. However, little documentation
   exists on drought occurrence in South Africa at national, provincial and
   municipal administrative boundaries. This study profiles hydrological
   drought in OR Tambo District Municipality from 1998 to 2018, computing
   frequency, severity and intensity in order to show areas of high
   vulnerability. Data used were obtained from South African Weather
   Services. Standardised precipitation index (SPI) was calculated using
   the Meteorological Drought Monitor (MDM) software. Results showed a wide
   variation in monthly precipitation throughout the year. Coastal areas
   receive higher rainfall than inland municipalities. The study revealed
   that Nyandeni experienced the highest drought frequency of 62\%,
   Mhlontlo (58\%), King Sabatha Dalindyebo Municipality (57\%), Ngquza
   Hill (55\%) and Port St Johns Municipality showing the least at 52\%.
   Hydrological drought severity frequency and duration varied between
   seven days and nine weeks. Drought intensity class exposed the annual
   average intensity for the five local municipalities represented as
   follows: KSDM (-0.71), PSJM (-0.99), Ngquza Hill (-0.81), Nyandeni
   (-0.71) and Mhlontlo (-0.62). The longest drought duration across OR
   Tambo was experienced in 2014 with durations varying from 3 to 11 weeks
   across the municipalities. OR Tambo District Municipality is susceptible
   to hydrological droughts and the extent varies across local
   municipalities. Results could be used for both adaptation planning and
   mitigating the impacts of future droughts. In addition, they could
   assist in guiding allocation of drought relief resources in ways that
   prioritise drought prone and vulnerable municipality.},

Title = {Extreme climatic events drive mammal irruptions: regression analysis of
   100-year trends in desert rainfall and temperature},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Extreme climatic events, such as flooding rains, extended decadal
   droughts and heat waves have been identified increasingly as important
   regulators of natural populations. Climate models predict that global
   warming will drive changes in rainfall and increase the frequency and
   severity of extreme events. Consequently, to anticipate how organisms
   will respond we need to document how changes in extremes of temperature
   and rainfall compare to trends in the mean values of these variables and
   over what spatial scales the patterns are consistent. Using the longest
   historical weather records available for central Australia 100 years -
   and quantile regression methods, we investigate if extreme climate
   events have changed at similar rates to median events, if annual
   rainfall has increased in variability, and if the frequency of large
   rainfall events has increased over this period. Specifically, we
   compared local (individual weather stations) and regional (Simpson
   Desert) spatial scales, and quantified trends in median (50th quantile)
   and extreme weather values (5th, 10th, 90th, and 95th quantiles). We
   found that median and extreme annual minimum and maximum temperatures
   have increased at both spatial scales over the past century. Rainfall
   changes have been inconsistent across the Simpson Desert; individual
   weather stations showed increases in annual rainfall, increased
   frequency of large rainfall events or more prolonged droughts, depending
   on the location. In contrast to our prediction, we found no evidence
   that intra-annual rainfall had become more variable over time. Using
   long-term live-trapping records (22 years) of desert small mammals as a
   case study, we demonstrate that irruptive events are driven by extreme
   rainfalls (> 95th quantile) and that increases in the magnitude and
   frequency of extreme rainfall events are likely to drive changes in the
   populations of these species through direct and indirect changes in
   predation pressure and wildfires.},

Abstract = {Changes in precipitation impact water availability in river basins;
   therefore, it is important to perform detailed analyses of precipitation
   variables within regions to better understand drivers of precipitation
   variability. This study, which focuses on the
   Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin in the southeastern United
   States, provides an analysis of precipitation variability during
   1980-2021 and connects that information to circulation variables while
   also exploring the alignment between recent and projected precipitation
   changes. Data include daily precipitation totals from 33 stations,
   monthly values for circulation indices, and downscaled precipitation
   projections from climate models. Results show the pressure gradient
   across the southwestern North Atlantic Ocean and southeastern United
   States-which is a function of the strength and position of the Bermuda
   High-is strongly correlated with the precipitation variables and might
   be an important control of precipitation variability in the basin. In
   contrast, most teleconnection indices are relatively weakly correlated
   with precipitation. The basin has generally been getting wetter, with
   summer having the largest increases in precipitation totals and
   precipitation days and thus large decreases in maximum consecutive dry
   days. Increases in heavy-precipitation variables are relatively small,
   with the largest increases in the northern portion of the basin.
   Precipitation is projected to increase in the next several decades
   compared to recent decades, with heavy precipitation expected to have
   the largest increase. Since the Bermuda High is likely the dominant
   driver of precipitation in the basin, more information is needed about
   specific changes to the Bermuda High in upcoming decades to better
   determine how precipitation might change.},

Abstract = {This study compares projected and past seasonal precipitation trends in
   the Eastern Black Sea Basin, Turkey. Historical data from twelve
   stations representing the basin during 1981-2010 was used, while
   statistically downscaled data from two representative concentration
   pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) outputs of the GFDL-ESM2M general
   circulation model were utilized for 2021-2050. To determine the seasonal
   trend behaviors of precipitation variables and transitions between
   consecutive months, the Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA) was
   implemented. Furthermore, the star concept was employed to illustrate
   the changing sizes between consecutive periods. Both scenarios showed
   considerable summer and autumn declines at almost all locations, with
   low seasonal precipitation variability. These scenarios indicated
   January to be the important month for trend shift, except for Rize,
   Pazar, and Hopa stations. The formation of several polygons, polygons
   intersecting, and polygons not forming on the global regression line
   show that the hydro-climatic cycle might be chaotic.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is affected by climate change, such as extreme increases or
   decreases rainfall and temperature patterns. It is possible to research
   that effect by using trend analysis methodologies. This paper
   investigates trends of monthly total rainfall and mean temperature data
   of nine selected stations from agricultural regions of Turkey between
   1969 and 2020. To the end, the classical Mann-Kendall, Innovative Trend
   Significance Test (ITST), and Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA)
   with Star Graph methods providing the opportunity to examine seasonal
   behavior were used for trend analysis. The analysis reveals that about
   96\% of all monthly rainfall in the Mann-Kendall test has no trend.
   However, nearly all stations tend to decrease (increase) in November
   (September) in both innovative approaches. For temperature, it is seen
   that increasing trend or no trend dominated in general. There were
   increasing trends in the innovative approaches throughout the year
   except for April. Temperatures have increased significantly throughout
   the year in all regions over the last decades. With the help of IPTA, it
   was also concluded that the seasonal internal variability of rainfall
   over the entire time and in the last 30 years is quite complex and
   persists in all agricultural regions. The results show that irregular
   changes in rainfall and rising temperatures in all stations negatively
   affected crop yield and/or required more irrigation. In addition,
   according to the results obtained by comparing trend methods, innovative
   approaches are very insistent on determining of trend and provide
   additional information through a visual review of trend behaviors.},

Title = {Trend and change-point detection analyses of rainfall and temperature
   over the Awash River basin of Ethiopia},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Awash River basin (ARB) as a system is in a state of continuous change
   that requires successive studies to discern the changes or trends of
   climatic elements through time due to climate change/variability, and
   other socioeconomical developmental activities in the basin. The
   livelihood of communities in the ARB is primarily based on
   rainfall-dependent agriculture. Effects of rainfall anomalies such as
   reduction of agricultural productivity, water scarcity, and food
   insecurity are becoming more prevalent in this area. In recent years,
   ARB has been experiencing more frequent rainfall anomalies that
   change-point detection test and trend analyses of basin rainfall
   associated with sea surface temperature is crucial in providing guidance
   to improve agricultural productivity in ARB. Change-point detection
   tests such as Pettit's, the von Neumann ratio (VNR), Buishand's range
   (BR) and standard normal homogeneity (SNH) plus trend analysis
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test of rainfall and temperature data from 29
   meteorological stations in the ARB were carried out from 1986 to 2016. A
   significant increasing trend of annual and seasonal temperature was
   found. The temperature change-points for the annual and major rainy
   season (MRS) were detected in 2001, while for the minor rainy season
   (mRS) in 1997. A significant decreasing trend, shift, and high
   variability of rainfall were detected in the downstream part of the ARB.
   The BR and SNH results showed that the mRS rainfall change-point was in
   1998, with a subsequent mean annual decrease of 52.5 mm. The increase
   (decrease) of rainfall in the annual and MRS was attributable to La Nina
   (El Nino) events. The significant decreasing trend and change-point of
   rainfall in the mRS was attributable to the steady warming of the Indian
   and Atlantic Oceans, local warming, and La Nina events. With this
   knowledge of the current trends and change-point for rainfall and
   temperature in the ARB, it is therefore essential that appropriate
   integrated water management and water-harvesting technologies are
   established, especially in the downstream areas. Moreover, early
   detection of El Nino episodes would provide invaluable warning of
   impending rainfall anomalies in the ARB and would enable better
   preparations to mitigate its negative effects.},

Abstract = {A weeklong workshop in Brazil in August 2004 provided the opportunity
   for 28 scientists from southern South America to examine daily rainfall
   observations to determine changes in both total and extreme rainfall.
   Twelve annual indices of daily rainfall were calculated over the period
   1960 to 2000, examining changes to both the entire distribution as well
   as the extremes. Maps of trends in the 12 rainfall indices showed large
   regions of coherent change, with many stations showing statistically
   significant changes in some of the indices. The pattern of trends for
   the extremes was generally the same as that for total annual rainfall,
   with a change to wetter conditions in Ecuador and northern Peru and the
   region of southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northern and central
   Argentina. A decrease was observed in southern Peru and southern Chile,
   with the latter showing significant decreases in many indices. A
   canonical correlation analysis between each of the indices and sea
   surface temperatures (SSTs) revealed two large-scale patterns that have
   contributed to the observed trends in the rainfall indices. A coupled
   pattern with ENSO-like SST loadings and rainfall loadings showing
   similarities with the pattern of the observed trend reveals that the
   change to a generally more negative Southern Oscillation index (SOI) has
   had an important effect on regional rainfall trends. A significant
   decrease in many of the rainfall indices at several stations in southern
   Chile and Argentina can be explained by a canonical pattern reflecting a
   weakening of the continental trough leading to a Southward shift in
   storm tracks. This latter signal is a change that has been seen at
   similar latitudes in other parts of the Southern Hemisphere. A similar
   analysis was carried out for eastern Brazil using gridded indices
   calculated from 354 stations from the Global Historical Climatology
   Network (GHCN) database. The observed trend toward wetter conditions in
   the southwest and drier conditions in the northeast could again be
   explained by changes in ENSO.},

   happening. Both parametric and non-parametric methods have been used to
   study climate change and variability. The study finds that there is a
   significant increase in annual minimum temperature than the annual
   maximum temperature in Assam. The fluctuations in annual minimum
   temperature as shown by the coefficient of variation are also more than
   the annual maximum temperature. Though the rainfall trend is not
   significant, the decreasing trend of rainfall in most of the stations

Abstract = {Climate variability, particularly that of the annual air temperature and
   rainfall, has received a great deal of attention worldwide. The
   magnitude of the variability or fluctuations of the factors varies
   according to locations. Hence, examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of
   meteorological variables in the context of changing climate,
   particularly in countries where rainfed agriculture is predominant, is
   vital to assess climate-induced changes and suggest feasible adaptation
   strategies. To that end, the present study examines long-term changes
   and short-term fluctuations in monsoonal rainfall and temperature over
   Kalahandi, Bolangir and Koraput (hereafter KBK) districts in the state
   of Odisha. Both rainfall and temperature data for period of 1980-2017
   were analyzed in this study. Statistical trend analysis techniques
   namely Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were used to examine
   and analyze the problems. The detailed analysis of the data for 37 years
   indicate that the annual maximum temperature and annual minimum
   temperature have shown an increasing trend, whereas the monsoon's
   maximum and minimum temperatures have shown a decreasing trend.
   Statistically significant trends are detected for rainfall and also the
   result is statistically significant at 99\% confidence limit during the
   period of 1980-2017. Rainfall is showing a quite good increasing trend
   (Sen's slope = 4.034) for JJAS season. In the case of maximum
   temperature for the observed period, it showed a slight warming or
   increasing trend (Sen's slope = 0.29) while the minimum temperature
   trend showed a cooling trend (Sen's slope = -0.006) but result of
   maximum temperature trend analysis is statistically significant at 95\%
   confidence limit, on the contrary, the trend analysis result of minimum
   temperature is not statistically significant.},

   increase following bud break until early June and then slowly declined
   until September 8, corresponding to an extended dry period (less than
   27\% of the annual rainfall of the previous 7 years). Dramatic increases
   in stem capacitance were observed following 55 mm of rain on September
   9, 1987. During autumn of both 1987 and 1988, stem capacitance steadily
   declined; mean capacitance of trees in seven plots in October and
   November 1987 was 55-89 and 35-47\% of values in June and July 1987,
   respectively. Diameter at breast height increment of 34 red spruce trees
   and 190 spruce and fir trees in permanent plots was consistently
   significantly (p < 0.001) related to mean monthly capacitance; the
   strongest relationships (55-83\% of the variability explained) were with
   mean June or July capacitance. The relationship of stem capacitance with
   growth of fir and spruce trees was corroborated. In addition, a stronger
   influence of water relations on capacitance than previously thought was
   demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Climate change has a significant impact on the environment as well as
   the social, economic and political fabric of Australia. This paper
   examines historical trends in temperature and rainfall in regions of
   Australia which represent different climatic regimes.
   In this study, we analyse trends in temperature and rainfall in three
   selected regions (Central eastern Queensland, south west Western
   Australia and central east Victoria) over the past 50-100 years.
   Observational data for daily maximum temperature, daily minimum
   temperature, daily mean temperature and total annual rainfall recorded
   at meteorological stations in these regions have been obtained from the
   National Climate Centre, Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM).
   Historical trends in the observational data have been examined using
   time series analysis. The results indicate that Australia is
   experiencing rapid climate change. Over the last 100 years, Australian
   temperatures have increased on average by approximately 1 degrees C.
   Rainfall distribution across the continent has changed during the last
   century and even more pronounced changes in rainfall patterns are
   evident over recent decades. Since the 1950s, an increase in rainfall in
   the northwest of Australia has been observed. In contrast, significant
   decline in rainfall over eastern and southwestern Australia has been
   recorded. Consequently, such trend as well as changes in rainfall and
   temperature patterns have manifested in changes of frequency of climate
   extremes such as droughts and floods.
   Detailed results of trend analysis of rainfall and temperature are
   presented. The results of this study are in good agreement with the
   findings of early studies.},
