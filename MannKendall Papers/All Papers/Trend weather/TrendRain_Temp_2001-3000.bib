Title = {Quantification of rainfall, temperature, and reference
   evapotranspiration trend and their interrelationship in sub-climatic

Abstract = {Rainfall, temperature, and reference evapotranspiration (ET0) have a
   significant influence on irrigation, aridity, flooding, and crop water
   requirements. The primary aims of this study were to analyze the trends
   in rainfall, temperature, and ET0 in seven sub-climatic zones of
   Bangladesh from 1989 to 2020, as well as examine their
   interrelationships. The Modified Mann-Kendall method was employed to
   assess trends, while linear regression was used for trend validation.
   ET0 was calculated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method, and Sen's
   slope was utilized to quantify the magnitude. Spatial analysis was
   conducted using Inverse Distance Weighting techniques. The findings
   revealed that annual rainfall increased only in the south-eastern zone,
   while the other zones experienced a decline. No significant changes were
   observed in annual maximum temperature, except in the south-eastern,
   north-eastern, and south-central zones, which showed variations ranging
   from 0.02 to 0.05 (degrees C/year). However, the yearly minimum
   temperature increased in all zones. Additionally, negative changes were
   observed in the annual magnitude of ET0 for all zones and seasons,
   except for the south-eastern and north-eastern zones, with a range of
   0.01-0.02 mm/year. It was also noted that rainfall and ET0 displayed a
   strong decreasing relationship, except during the pre-monsoon season.
   Regarding regional variation, the northern regions exhibited a
   significant decreasing trend in both rainfall and ET0. The study
   identified key challenges, including water scarcity and irrigation
   difficulties due to declining rainfall and evapotranspiration, increased
   aridity, changing flood patterns, temperature-related impacts on crop
   growth, regional disparities in climate trends, and the need for
   effective climate change adaptation measures. Therefore, the study's
   findings can contribute to knowledge in areas such as irrigation
   scheduling, promoting climate-smart agricultural practices, encouraging
   crop diversification to reduce dependence on water-intensive crops
   cultivation, and planning resilient water resource management to
   minimize the effects of environmental shifts, regulate human operations,
   and implement disaster remedial actions in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Drought was a severe recurring phenomenon in Iraq over the past two
   decades due to climate change despite the fact that Iraq has been one of
   the most water-rich countries in the Middle East in the past. The Iraqi
   Kurdistan Region (IKR) is located in the north of Iraq, which has also
   suffered from extreme drought. In this study, the drought severity
   status in Sulaimaniyah Province, one of four provinces of the IKR, was
   investigated for the years from 1998 to 2017. Thus, Landsat time series
   dataset, including 40 images, were downloaded and used in this study.
   The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized
   Difference Water Index (NDWI) were utilized as spectral-based drought
   indices and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was employed as a
   meteorological-based drought index, to assess the drought severity and
   analyse the changes of vegetative cover and water bodies. The study area
   experienced precipitation deficiency and severe drought in 1999, 2000,
   2008, 2009, and 2012. Study findings also revealed a drop in the
   vegetative cover by 33.3\% in the year 2000. Furthermore, the most
   significant shrinkage in water bodies was observed in the Lake
   Darbandikhan (LDK), which lost 40.5\% of its total surface area in 2009.
   The statistical analyses revealed that precipitation was significantly
   positively correlated with the SPI and the surface area of the LDK
   (correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.72, respectively). The
   relationship between SPI and NDVI-based vegetation cover was positive
   but not significant. Low precipitation did not always correspond to
   vegetative drought; the delay of the effect of precipitation on NDVI was
   one year.},

Title = {Trends in the precipitation regime and sustainable management of
   Agroecosystems: Study of a case in the northwest of the province of
   Buenos Aires, Argentina},
Journal = {REVISTA DE CLIMATOLOGIA},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {During the last few decades the importance of climate change on
   agroecosystem sustainable management has been realized. Dealing with
   those matters requires an interdisciplinary approach that can be
   directed through a case study methodology. A very interesting case study
   example can be found in northwest Buenos Aires Province (Argentina),
   where the increase of rainfall regime allowed an increase of dryland
   agriculture. It is important to elucidate if this phenomenon constitutes
   irreversible change or it belongs to a long term cycle, with dry and
   humid phases, separated by transitional phases. It could be verified
   that, although both theories showed significant correlations with the
   observed phenomena, the hydric cycle theory explained a higher amount of
   the total variance of the series under study. Even when evidence enough
   to demonstrate the validity one or another theory is not yet available,
   strategic decisions conducive to agricultural production in one or
   another environment must be taken into consideration. If the theory of
   permanent increase is taken as valid, the strategy should be directed to
   take advantage of the high moisture availability, looking for the
   maximum productivity. On the contrary, if the hydric cycle theory is
   adopted, it should be necessary to adjust the system looking for the
   maximum reliability instead of the maximum productivity. Although this
   precautionary measure would imply a lesser rent, due to the costs of
   irrigation system and other dryland farming technologies, it would allow
   the production system to resist long dry periods. It is the lack of
   adequate preventive measures and not the decrease of rainfall what may
   cause a productive and environmental catastrophe.},

Abstract = {Poultry manure is the primary cause of nitrate (NO3-) exceedances in the
   transboundary Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer (ASA; Canada-USA) based on
   synoptic surveys two decades apart, but questions remained about
   seasonal and spatial aspects of agricultural nitrate fluxes to the
   aquifer to help better focus remediation efforts. We conducted over 700
   monthly delta N-15 and delta O-18 of nitrate assays, focusing on shallow
   groundwater (< 5 years old) over a 5-year period to gain new insight on
   spatio-temporal sources and controls of groundwater nitrate
   contamination. NO3- concentrations in these wells ranged from 1.3 to 99
   mg NL-1 (n = 1041) with a mean of 16.2 +/- 0.4 mg NL-1. The
   high-frequency N-15 and O-18 isotope data allowed us to identify three
   distinctive NO3- source patterns: (i) primarily from synthetic
   fertilizer, (ii) dynamic changes in nitrate due to changes in land use,
   and (iii) from a mix of poultry manure and fertilizer. A key finding was
   that the source(s) of nitrate in recharge could be quickly influenced by
   short-term near-field management practices and stochastic precipitation
   events, which ultimately impact long-term nitrate contamination trends.
   Overall, the isotope data affirmed a subtle decadal-scale shift in
   agricultural practices from manure increasingly towards fertilizer
   nitrate sources; nevertheless, poultry-derived N remains a predominant
   source of nitrate contamination. Because the aquifer does not generally
   support denitrification, remediation of the Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer is
   possible only if agricultural N sources are seriously curtailed, a
   difficult proposition due to longstanding high-value inten-sive poultry
   and raspberry and blueberry operations over the aquifer.},

Abstract = {Smallholder farmers in East and West Hararghe zones, Ethiopia frequently
   face problems of climate extremes. Knowledge of past and projected
   climate change and variability at local and regional scales can help
   develop adaptation measures. A study was therefore conducted to
   investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of rainfall and temperature in
   the past (1988-2017) and projected periods of 2030 and 2050 under two
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) at selected
   stations in East and West Hararghe zones, Ethiopia. To detect the trends
   and magnitude of change Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were
   employed, respectively. The result of the study indicated that for the
   last three decades annual and seasonal and monthly rainfall showed high
   variability but the changes are not statistically significant. On the
   other hand, the minimum temperature of the `Belg' season showed a
   significant (p < 0.05) increment. The mean annual minimum temperature is
   projected to increase by 0.34 degrees C and 2.52 degrees C for 2030, and
   0.41 degrees C and 4.15 degrees C for 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5,
   respectively. Additionally, the mean maximum temperature is projected to
   change by -0.02 degrees C and 1.14 degrees C for 2030, and 0.54 degrees
   C and 1.87 degrees C for 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively.
   Annual rainfall amount is also projected to increase by 2.5\% and 29\%
   for 2030, and 12\% and 32\% for 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5,
   respectively. Hence, it is concluded that there was an increasing trend
   in the Belg season minimum temperature. A significant increasing trend
   in rainfall and temperature are projected compared to the baseline
   period for most of the districts studied. This implies a need to design
   climate-smart crop and livestock production strategies, as well as an
   early warning system to counter the drastic effects of climate change
   and variability on agricultural production and farmers' livelihood in
   the region.},

Abstract = {The hydroclimatology of the Peruvian Amazon-Andes basin (PAB) which
   surface corresponding to 7\% of the Amazon basin is still poorly
   documented. We propose here an extended and original analysis of the
   temporal evolution of monthly rainfall, mean temperature (T-mean),
   maximum temperature (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) time series
   over two PABs (Huallaga and Ucayali) over the last 40years. This
   analysis is based on a new and more complete database that includes 77
   weather stations over the 1965-2007 period, and we focus our attention
   on both annual and seasonal meteorological time series. A positive
   significant trend in mean temperature of 0.09 degrees C per decade is
   detected over the region with similar values in the Andes and rainforest
   when considering average data. However, a high percentage of stations
   with significant T-mean positive trends are located over the Andes
   region. Finally, changes in the mean values occurred earlier in T-max
   (during the 1970s) than in T-min (during the 1980s). In the PAB, there
   is neither trend nor mean change in rainfall during the 1965-2007
   period. However, annual, summer and autumn rainfall in the southern
   Andes presents an important interannual variability that is associated
   with the sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic Ocean while
   there are limited relationships between rainfall and El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) events. On the contrary, the interannual temperature
   variability is mainly related to ENSO events. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Title = {A long-term trend in precipitation of different spatial regions of
   Bangladesh and its teleconnections with El Nio/Southern Oscillation and
   Indian Ocean Dipole},

Abstract = {A long-term (1948 to 2012) trend of precipitation (annual, pre-monsoon,
   monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons) in Bangladesh was analyzed in
   different regions using both parametric and nonparametric approaches.
   Moreover, the possible teleconnections of precipitation (annual and
   monsoon) variability with El Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episode and
   Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) were investigated using both average and
   individual (both positive and negative) values of ENSO index and IOD.
   Our findings suggested that for annual precipitation, a significant
   increasing monotonic trend was found in whole Bangladesh (4.87 mm/year),
   its western region (5.82 mm/year) including Rangpur (9.41 mm/year) and
   Khulna (4.95 mm/year), and Sylhet (10.12 mm/year) and Barisal (6.94
   mm/year) from eastern region. In pre-monsoon, only Rangpur (2.88
   mm/year) showed significant increasing trend, while in monsoon, whole
   Bangladesh (3.04 mm/year), Sylhet (7.17 mm/year), and Barisal (6.94
   mm/year) showed similar trend. In post-monsoon, there was no significant
   trend. Our results also revealed that the precipitation (annual or
   monsoon) of whole Bangladesh and almost all of the spatial regions did
   not show any significant correlation with ENSO events, whereas the
   average IOD values showed significant correlation only in monsoon
   precipitation of western region. The individual positive IODs showed
   significant correlation in whole Bangladesh, western region, and its two
   divisions (Rajshahi and Khulna). So, in the context of Bangladesh
   climate, IOD has the more teleconnection to precipitation than that of
   ENSO. Our findings indicate that the co-occurrence of ENSO and IOD
   events may suppress their influence on each other.},

Abstract = {In this review, the current state of research on textile-based
   temperature sensors is explored by focusing on their potential use in
   various applications. The textile-based sensors show various advantages
   including flexibility, conformability and seamlessness for the wearer.
   Integration of the textile-based sensors into clothes or fabric-based
   products enables continuous and sensitive monitoring of change in
   temperature, which can be used for various medical and fitness
   applications. However, there are lacks of comprehensive review on the
   textile-based temperature sensors. This review introduces various types
   of textile-based temperature sensors, including resistive,
   thermoelectric and fibre-optical sensors. In addition, the challenges
   that need to be addressed to fully realise their potential, which
   include improving sensitivity and accuracy, integrating wireless
   communication capabilities, and developing low-cost fabrication
   techniques. The technological advances in textile-based temperature
   sensors to overcome the limitations will revolutionize wearable devices
   requiring function of temperature monitoring.},

Abstract = {The increase in air temperature can generate several environmental and
   socioeconomic impacts, so the main objective of this study was to
   characterize the monthly and annual profiles of maximum, minimum, and
   average air temperatures and to identify whether there are significant
   trends in the time series of each, for the state of Alagoas, Brazil. For
   this, monthly data on maximum and minimum air temperatures (1980 to
   2013) were used for 98 of the 102 municipalities in Alagoas. With the
   data in hand, the average air temperature was calculated and cluster
   analysis was applied to determine homogeneous sub-regions of the average
   air temperature. Trend analyses were verified using nonparametric
   Mann-Kendall (sign of trend), Sen (magnitude of trend), and Pettitt
   (beginning of trend) tests. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to
   verify differences between the decennial average air temperatures. The
   statistical significance adopted was 5\%. The results showed that the
   state of Alagoas has four sub-regions with homogeneous characteristics
   according to average air temperature. Sub-region 4 (S4), located in the
   Sertao (scrubland region) of Alagoas, had the highest average, maximum,
   and minimum air temperatures, monthly and annually. Annually,
   significantly increasing trends were observed at 5\% in the four
   sub-regions, with emphasis on S4, with increases above 1.0 C/decade in
   average, maximum, and minimum temperatures. These results may help
   decision makers who need knowledge about the behavior and trends of air
   temperature (average, maximum, and minimum).},

Abstract = {Mediterranean viticulture could suffer from hotter and drier growing
   seasons over the coming decades. The present article focuses on the
   wine-producing area Ctes-du-Roussillon-Villages near Perpignan, in
   southern France. We used observational daily data (1925-2010) from
   Perpignan weather station and daily outputs (2001-2060) of the regional
   climate model ARPEGE-RETIC-V4 from M,t,o-France with scenarios A2, A1B
   and B1, to assess the exposure of the regional wine system to changes in
   temperature and precipitation, both in the recent past and the coming
   decades (1925-2060). Temperatures during the growing season and summer
   temperature extremes have been increasing continuously since the
   mid-1980s and are projected to increase faster from the mid-2040s.
   Precipitation is highly variable and very low in summer, and projections
   suggest greater uncertainty, and more extreme drought events could be
   expected. The analysis of climate data was complemented by thirty-two
   in-depth interviews with local actors of the wine industry to assess the
   impacts of climate change on their activities and potential adaptive
   options. Producers reported negative impacts of recent changes in
   climate in conjunction with a difficult economic situation. Analyses of
   historical, social and economic backgrounds are important to fully
   conceptualize the nature and extent of climate change risks in the
   region. This case study provides important insights into the roles of
   non-climatic factors in the generation of vulnerability for
   Mediterranean agricultural systems facing rapid climate change.},

Abstract = {In the context of global warming, determining to what extent natural
   variability and external forcing have an impact on climate change is
   crucial for formulating mitigation policies and adaptation plans. We
   quantifiably and effectively separate unnatural trends from the global
   land surface air temperature (SAT) changes during 1951-2015 by
   calculating the long-term correlation exponent through detrended
   fluctuation analysis and applying mainly probability statistics methods.
   We provide effective discriminated evidence for whether the observed SAT
   change exceeds its natural internal variability. Furthermore, we search
   the range of SAT changes caused by unnatural trends, and identify their
   corresponding minimum contributions to warming relative trends in
   different regions. The unnatural warming of the mid- to high latitude
   inland areas of Eurasia and North America is basically high, and the
   warming responses to unnatural forcing are most intense in these areas.
   Compared to earlier detection, we find the minimum unnatural trend
   contributes more than 80\% to the observed SAT change in North America,
   northern Greenland, eastern Africa, and the mid- to high latitudes of
   Eurasia. In addition, the temporal evolutions of unnatural trends in key
   areas are determined. In North Africa, Western Australia, the United
   States and Mexico, the unnatural impact became significant at the
   earliest. Meanwhile, the overall unnatural trend in North Africa is the
   most significant, followed by western Brazil, and grows most rapidly
   over time in the two key areas.},

   Era Retrospective-Analysis (MERRA), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis
   (CFSR), Radiosonde Atmospheric Temperature Products for Assessing
   Climate (RATPAC), HadAT2, and RICHv1.5. All model predictions are dry
   biased. The interannual anomalies of the model predictions show periods
   of fairly regular oscillations, alternating with more quiescent periods
   and a few large-amplitude oscillations. They all agree well (correlation
   coefficients 0.9 and larger) with observations for higher-frequency
   variations (periods up to 2-3 years). Differences between SWV
   observations, and temperature data, respectively, render analysis of the
   model minus observation residual difficult. However, we find fairly
   well-defined periods of drifts in the residuals. For the 1980s, model
   predictions differ most, and only the calculation with ERA-Interim
   temperatures is roughly within observational uncertainties. All model
   predictions show a drying relative to HALOE in the 1990s, followed by a
   moistening in the early 2000s. Drifts to NOAA-FPH are similar (but
   stronger), whereas no drift is present against SAGE II. As a result, the
   model calculations have a less pronounced drop in SWV in 2000 than
   HALOE. From the mid-2000s onward, models and observations agree
   reasonably, and some differences can be traced to problems in the
   temperature data. These results indicate that both SWV and temperature
   data may still suffer from artifacts that need to be resolved in order
   to answer the question whether the large-scale flow and temperature
   field is sufficient to explain water entering the stratosphere.},

Abstract = {We analysed long-term temperature trends based on 12 homogenised series
   of monthly temperature data in Switzerland at elevations between 316
   m.a.s.l. and 2490 m.a.s.l for the 20(th) century (1901-2000) and for the
   last thirty years (1975-2004). Comparisons were made between these two
   periods, with changes standardised to decadal trends. Our results show
   mean decadal trends of +0.135 degrees C during the 20(th) century and
   +0.57 degrees C based on the last three decades only. These trends are
   more than twice as high as the averaged temperature trends in the
   Northern Hemisphere.
   Most stations behave quite similarly, indicating that the increasing
   trends are linked to large-scale rather than local processes. Seasonal
   analyses show that the greatest temperature increase in the 1975-2004
   period occurred during spring and summer whereas they were particularly
   weak in spring during the 20(th) century. Recent temperature increases
   are as much related to increases in maximum temperatures as to increases
   in minimum temperature, a trend that was not apparent in the 1901-2000
   period. The different seasonal warming rates may have important
   consequences for vegetation, natural disasters, human health, and energy
   consumption, amongst others. The strong increase in summer temperatures
   helps to explain the accelerated glacier retreat in the Alps since 1980.},

Title = {GLOBAL AND HEMISPHERIC TEMPERATURE TRENDS - UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO
   INADEQUATE SPATIAL SAMPLING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1144-1163},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Long-term (50 to 100 years) and short-term (10 to 30 years) global and
   hemispheric trends of temperature have an inherent unknown error due to
   incomplete and nonrandom spatial sampling. A number of experiments have
   been conducted to help quantify the potential magnitude of this error.
   The analysis includes the errors introduced into the climate record
   because of both incomplete global coverage and inadequate sampling
   within those areas presumed to have adequate observations. In these
   experiments it is found that the uncertainty in calculating historical
   temperature trends is dependent upon the pattern of temperature change,
   the method of treating the effect of nonrandom spatial sampling, and the
   time and length over which the trend is calculated but is relatively
   insensitive to the random errors associated with estimating
   regional-scale (grid cell size) temperature anomalies.
   Results imply that the errors associated with century-scale trends of
   temperature are probably an order of magnitude smaller than the observed
   global warming of nearly 0.5-degrees-C per 100 years since the late
   nineteenth century. The errors in estimates of decadal temperature
   trends are found to be large relative to century-scale trends and are
   unreliable during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Even
   during the recent decade of the 1980s, the area-averaging techniques
   used in some analyses could be improved by addressing the over-sampling
   of Northern Hemisphere (especially over land) relative to the rest of
   the globe. Otherwise, significant positive biases are likely during the
   1980s. These biases may have contributed to the reported differences
   between in situ surface and space-based temperatures during the 1980s.
   The rather encouraging results with respect to the magnitude of the
   spatial sampling errors associated with the calculation of long-term
   trends beginning in the nineteenth century cast a positive light on
   efforts aimed at extending the proxy and observed global temperature
   record further back in time, despite limited geographic coverage.},

Abstract = {We develop a post-millennium mid-tropospheric temperature time series
   from continuous observations by advanced microwave sounders onboard
   satellites in stable sun-synchronous orbits. Such observations have high
   radiometric stability and do not experience diurnal sampling changes
   over time, allowing us to develop merged time series from multiple
   satellites with an accuracy better than 0.012 Kelvin/Decade. With such
   high accuracy, the resulting time series can be used as a reference
   measurement of climate variability and trends in atmospheric
   temperatures. The warming rate from this time series for the atmospheric
   layer between surface and 10 km is 0.230 +/- 0.134 Kelvin/Decade during
   the period from 2002 to 2020, which is similar to 14\% higher than the
   existing satellite microwave sounder datasets. Our finding provides new
   insight on trend differences among microwave sounder temperature data
   sets developed by different research groups, and is also helpful in
   reconciling trend differences between satellite observations and climate
   model simulations.},

Abstract = {Over the past two years, a series of papers have been published
   concerning bearing temperature trending and a mechanism to explain this
   troubling phenomenon. In September of 2008, a collaborative field test
   between The Union Pacific Railroad (UP), Amsted Rail, Rail Sciences Inc.
   (RSI), and The University of Texas-Pan American (UTPA) was conducted to
   corroborate the findings of laboratory research and testing. Field and
   laboratory results confirm that temperature trended bearings exhibit
   vibration signals that can be distinguished from healthy bearings.
   Distinct primary frequencies and overtones associated with the axle,
   cone, cage, and rollers can be readily identified within a bearing
   vibration signal. In a previous paper, it was demonstrated that a
   trended bearing exhibits vibrations of higher magnitude. However, all
   characteristic frequencies appear in both healthy and trended bearings,
   but those that dominate, i.e., have higher magnitude, are distinct for
   trended bearings when compared to healthy bearings. The latter can be
   repeatedly demonstrated in both field and laboratory experiments.
   Moreover, the current work identifies and distinguishes between the
   primary bearing frequencies and those linked to roller misalignment,
   which is known to increase friction and wear, and consequently raise the
   bearing temperature.},

Abstract = {THE ability to distinguish a warming trend from natural variability is
   critical for an understanding of the climatic response to increasing
   greenhouse-gas concentrations.  Here we use singular spectrum analysis 1
   to analyse the time series of global surface air temperatures for the
   past 135 years 2, allowing a secular warming trend and a small number of
   oscillatory modes to be separated from the noise.  The trend is flat
   until 1910, with an increase of 0.4-degrees-C since then.  The
   oscillations exhibit interdecadal periods of 21 and 16 years, and
   interannual periods of 6 and 5 years.  The interannual oscillations are
   probably related to global aspects of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) phenomenon 3.  The interdecadal oscillations could be associated
   with changes in the extratropical ocean circulation 4.  The oscillatory
   components have combined (peak-to-peak) amplitudes of > 0.2-degrees-C,
   and therefore limit our ability to predict whether the inferred secular
   warming trend of 0.005-degrees-C yr-1 will continue.  This could
   postpone incontrovertible detection of the greenhouse warming signal for
   one or two decades.},

Title = {Temporal Trends and Future Projections of Accumulated Temperature
   Changes in China},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {The Fifth IPCC Assessment Report indicates that climate change will
   affect crop growth and threaten the stability of food systems.
   Accumulated temperature, which is closely related to vegetation
   phenology and cropping systems, is an important indicator of heat in a
   region. Studying the history and future accumulated temperature changes
   can provide scientific reference for the change of crop phenology and
   cropping system, which is important for the improvement of grain
   production in China. Based on the MK trend test, MK abrupt change test
   and interpretable machine learning model, this study analyzes the
   spatial and temporal variation of accumulated temperature in China from
   1979 to 2018, predicts its future variation based on CMIP6, and
   investigates the dominant influencing factors among different
   agricultural regions. The study found that (1) the accumulated
   temperature belt shows a northward shift and retreat trend toward higher
   altitudes, and the area of the high accumulated temperature belt
   increases year by year, leading to the narrowing of the area of the low
   accumulated temperature belt year by year, and the trend remains
   unchanged under the future scenario; meanwhile, the northward shift
   trend of the accumulated temperature belt is greatly mitigated and
   curbed under the SSP126 scenario. (2) The changes of accumulated
   temperature belt are mainly influenced by the increase of accumulated
   temperature duration days, and secondarily by the increase of
   temperature. The contribution brought by the first day of accumulated
   temperature from 1979 to 2018 is greater than that brought by the last
   day of accumulated temperature, while in the future scenario, on the
   contrary, changes in vegetation phenology delay should be given more
   attention.},

Title = {Physical effects of habitat-forming species override latitudinal trends
   in temperature},
Journal = {ECOLOGY LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {190-196},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Latitudinal and elevational temperature gradients (LTG and ETG) play
   central roles in biogeographical theory, underpinning predictions of
   large-scale patterns in organismal thermal stress, species' ranges and
   distributional responses to climate change. Yet an enormous fraction of
   Earth's taxa live exclusively in habitats where foundation species
   modify temperatures. We examine little-explored implications of this
   widespread trend using a classic model system for understanding heat
   stresses - rocky intertidal shores. Through integrated field
   measurements and laboratory trials, we demonstrate that thermal
   buffering by centimetre-thick mussel and seaweed beds eliminates
   differences in stress-inducing high temperatures and associated
   mortality risk that would otherwise arise over 14 degrees of latitude
   and similar to 1m of shore elevation. These results reveal the extent to
   which physical effects of habitat-formers can overwhelm broad-scale
   thermal trends, suggesting a need to re-evaluate climate change
   predictions for many species. Notably, inhabitant populations may
   exhibit deceptive resilience to warming until refuge-forming taxa become
   imperiled.},

Title = {Recalibration and merging of SSU observations for stratospheric

Abstract = {Long-term observations from the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) during
   1979-2006 onboard NOAA historical polar orbiting satellites were
   recalibrated for climate change investigation. A two-point linear
   calibration equation, with cold space and an internal blackbody warm
   target as end-point references, was used to transfer SSU raw counts data
   into radiances. The warm target temperature was represented by
   measurements from the space side thermistor on the blackbody, and the
   cold space radiance was assumed to be zero. Space view corrections due
   to an electrical interference were applied. Intersatellite calibration
   was conducted simultaneously by applying calibration offsets determined
   from residual intersatellite biases. The recalibration reached an
   accuracy of 0.1-0.2 K for global means and thus is expected to improve
   the consistency in stratospheric temperature time series in climate
   reanalyses. The recalibrated SSU radiances were further adjusted to
   develop Version 2 of the NOAA stratospheric temperature time series. The
   effects being adjusted included those from changes in instrument cell
   pressure and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, viewing angle
   differences, and semidiurnal tides due to orbital drift. Intersatellite
   biases were carefully removed to ensure smooth transitions between
   satellite pairs. Differences from Version 1 included improved radiance
   calibration, improved adjusting schemes for diurnal drift and
   intersatellite biases, removal of time-varying cell pressure adjustment
   for NOAA-9 channel 1, and excluding NOAA-7 channel 2 in the time series.
   In addition to the final merged data set, intermediate synthetic time
   series corresponding to different adjustments were also created to
   quantify their impact on the final trend as well as its reliability and
   uncertainty. Excellent matching between satellite pairs, especially the
   7 year overlaps between NOAA-11 and NOAA-14 during 1997-2004, in
   intermediate as well as the final time series provided strong evidence
   on the validity of adjustments and thus confidence on the resulting
   trends. The Version 2 global mean trends for 1979-2006 were - 0.69 +/-
   0.18, -0.77 +/- 0.15, and - 0.85 +/- 0.15 K/decade for SSU channels 1,
   2, and 3, representing temperatures of middle stratosphere, upper
   stratosphere, and stratosphere-mesosphere, respectively. Among these,
   cooling of channel 2 was stronger and channel 3 weaker than those in UK
   Met Office (UKMO) data by about 1 K during the entire SSU period from
   1979 to 2006. Finally, the average of the channel 1 and channel 3
   anomalies in Version 2 was close to channel 2 anomalies to within 0.2 K
   for the entire 1979-2006 period with identical trends. This feature was
   found consistent with chemistry-climate model simulations.},

Title = {Trends in Mediterranean gridded temperature extremes and large-scale
   circulation influences},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2199-2214},
Abstract = {Two recently-available daily gridded datasets are used to investigate
   trends in Mediterranean temperature extremes since the mid-20th century.
   The underlying trends are found to be generally consistent with global
   trends of temperature and their extremes: cold extremes decrease and
   warm/hot extremes increase. This consistency is better manifested in the
   western part of the Mediterranean where changes are most pronounced
   since the mid-1970s. In the eastern part, a cooling is observed, with a
   near reversal in the last two decades. This inter-basin discrepancy is
   clearer in winter, while in summer changes are more uniform and the
   west-east difference is restricted to the rate of increase of warm/hot
   extremes, which is higher in central and eastern parts of the
   Mediterranean over recent decades. Linear regression and correlation
   analysis reveals some influence of major large-scale atmospheric
   circulation patterns on the occurrence of these extremes - both in terms
   of trend and interannual variability. These relationships are not,
   however, able to account for the most striking features of the
   observations - in particular the intensification of the increasing trend
   in warm/hot extremes, which is most evident over the last 15-20 yr in
   the Central and Eastern Mediterranean.},

Abstract = {Climate variability, particularly, that of the annual air temperature
   and precipitation, has received a great deal of attention worldwide. The
   magnitude of the variability of the factors changes according to the
   locations. The present study focuses on detecting the trends and
   variability in the annual temperature and rainfall for the district of
   Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, India. This study used annual and monsoon
   time series data for the time period 1981-2010 and modified the
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator in analyzing the problem.
   The results of the analysis indicate that the annual maximum temperature
   (TMX) and annual minimum temperature (TMN) for the period of 30 years
   have shown an increasing trend, whereas the monsoon's maximum and
   minimum temperatures have shown a decreasing trend, although it is
   statistically not significant. The amount of annual rainfall does not
   show any significant trend, but the monsoonal rainfall has shown an
   increasing trend that is also statistically not significant. The
   resulting Mann-Kendall test statistic (Z) and Sen's slope estimate (Q)
   of all the parameters studied indicate that changes are occurring in the
   magnitude and timing of the precipitation and temperature events at the
   Mandi station.},

Abstract = {Tropical cyclone (TC) activity is influenced by environmental factors,
   and it is expected to respond to anthropogenic climate change. However,
   there is observational uncertainty in historical changes in TC activity,
   and attributing observed TC changes to anthropogenic forcing is
   challenging in the presence of internal climate variability. The sea
   surface temperature (SST) is a well-observed environmental factor that
   affects TC intensity and rainfall. Here we show that the SST at the time
   of TC genesis has a significant warming trend over the three decades of
   the satellite era. Though TCs are extreme events, the warming trend at
   TC genesis is comparable to the trend in SST during other tropical deep
   convection events and the trend in SST in the TC main development
   regions throughout the TC season. This newly documented, observed
   signature of climate change on TC activity is also present in
   high-resolution global atmospheric model simulations that explicitly
   simulate TCs.},

Abstract = {The complexity of the climatic system determined the variable
   manifestation of the thermal oscillation compared to normal state (30
   years, 1961-1990 according to World Meteorological Organization). The
   present study assesses variability in air temperature, through the
   analysis of the temperature data set, between 1961-2010 for 7 weather
   stations located outside the Carpathians: Botosani, Suceava, Iasi,
   Roman, Bacau, Galati, Buzau, taken from the European Climate Assistant
   and Datasets and ROCADA databases.
   The altitudinal amplitude of 254 m (Gala.i 71 m and Suceava 325 m)
   results in an annual mean difference of 1.5 degrees C, the latitudinal
   amplitude (2 degrees 20 `) results in a significant change in
   temperature, horizontally (nearly 2 degrees C, taking into account the
   fact that, for the northern hemisphere, the temperature varies with 0.86
   degrees C/1 degrees latitude). The use of the Gorczynski continentality
   index, removes the temperature differences set by latitude, the altitude
   influence being insignificant in the context of the atmospheric boundary
   layer circulation.
   For extra-Carpathian Moldavia, the temperature evolution trend is rising
   for mean, minimum, maximum, and also related phenomena (periods of
   drought, hail, tropical nights, days of summer). Thermal variability, as
   measured by statistic indices associated with extreme values,
   temperature anomalies and amplitudes has values higher in the cold
   season than in the warm one.
   Spatially, warming is highlighted by significant increases in positive
   trend, ranging between 0.8 degrees C 1 degrees C in the case of all the
   7 stations analyzed, with higher average values in the North in the cold
   season and South in the warm season.
   The results were based on analysis of the Gorczynsky index, as well as
   the application of those recommended by STARDEX: heat wave duration
   (Txhwd), cold wave duration (Tncwd) 90th percentile (txq90) for the
   maximum daily values and 10th percentile (tnq10) for minimum daily
   values. Spatial and temporal comparison of thermal anomalies was
   achieved through standardization of data, which meant removing the
   influence of the seasonal cycle, dividing the relative thermal anomaly
   to the standard deviation.},

Title = {The role of irrigation expansion in past and future temperature trends},
Journal = {EARTH INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {1-11},
Abstract = {Expansion of irrigated land can cause local cooling of daytime
   temperatures by up to several degrees Celsius. Here the authors compare
   the expected cooling associated with rates of irrigation expansion in
   developing countries for historical (1961-2000) and future (2000-30)
   periods with climate model predictions of temperature changes from other
   forcings, most notably increased atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, over
   the same periods. Indirect effects of irrigation on climate, via methane
   production in paddy rice systems, were not considered. In regions of
   rapid irrigation growth over the past 40 yr, such as northwestern India
   and northeastern China, irrigation's expected cooling effects have been
   similar in magnitude to climate model predictions of warming from
   greenhouse gases. A masking effect of irrigation can therefore explain
   the lack of significant increases in observed growing season maximum
   temperatures in these regions and the apparent discrepancy between
   observations and climate model simulations. Projections of irrigation
   for 2000 - 30 indicate a slowing of expansion rates, and therefore
   cooling from irrigation expansion over this time period will very likely
   be smaller than in recent decades. At the same time, warming from
   greenhouse gases will likely accelerate, and irrigation will play a
   relatively smaller role in agricultural climate trends. In many
   irrigated regions, therefore, temperature projections from climate
   models, which generally ignore irrigation, may be more accurate in
   predicting future temperature trends than their performance in
   reproducing past observed trends in irrigated regions would suggest.},

Title = {PFAS concentrations and deposition in precipitation: An intensive
   5-month study at National Atmospheric Deposition Program - National
   trends sites (NADP-NTN) across Wisconsin, USA},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {291},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Atmospheric transport and processing of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) leads to deposition and accumulation of these
   compounds in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, however, measurements
   of PFAS flux and deposition rates remain sparse and underdeveloped. In
   2020, ninety-one precipitation samples, along with an array of QA/QC
   samples were collected from eight National Trends Network (NTN) sites
   across Wisconsin through the National Atmospheric Deposition Program
   (NADP). Weekly precipitation samples were analyzed for a suite of 34
   PFAS compounds to provide measurements of speciated PFAS concentrations
   and deposition fluxes to in the Upper Great Lakes Region. Perfluoro
   carboxylates (PFCAs) were detected most frequently and constituted an
   average of 83\% of the total mass quantified across the samples. Summed
   PFAS mass concentrations in the rainwater ranged from 0.7 to 6.1 ng/L
   with a median of 1.5 ng/L. Daily flux values ranged from 1.3 to 47.4
   ng/m(2)/day with a median of 5.7 ng/m(2)/day. From an analysis of
   variance (ANOVA), significant differences in the average chemical
   profiles (PFAS fingerprints) were observed among the 8 sampling sites,
   indicating that nearby sources of PFAS can potentially influence
   wet-deposition composition of certain species on observed spatial
   scales. Strict quality control measures were developed and implemented
   for this study to confirm that the field and laboratory methods met the
   necessary high data quality standards. These methods and QA/QC protocols
   are detailed here to provide guidance for future wet deposition sampling
   of PFAS. This campaign confirms the efficacy of NADP-NTN samplers and
   protocols for the collection and study of PFAS atmospheric transport,
   deposition rates, and spatial trends in concentrations and flux.},

Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organochlorine pesticide, and polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon (PAR) concentrations were measured in air (in the
   vapor and particle phases) and in precipitation samples collected at
   Point Petre on the northeastern shore of Lake Ontario as a part of the
   Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network. These data were measured in
   two separate studies, one running from 1992 to 2003 (inclusive) and the
   other from 1998 to 2011 (inclusive). Having these two independent
   studies is a direct way of measuring changes in atmospheric
   concentrations and comparing interstudy changes to intrastudy changes.
   The concentrations of almost all pesticides declined between the two
   studies with halving times of 3-6 years; the concentrations of PAHs and
   PCBs did not change much between the two studies. This suggests that
   there are continuing sources of PAHs and PCBs to the Great Lakes
   atmosphere. PAR concentrations were elevated in the winter when space
   heating consumes greater amounts of fuel and emits larger amounts of
   PAL-Is. Pesticide and PCB concentrations were elevated in the summer
   because of enhanced volatilization from terrestrial or aquatic surfaces
   during hot summer days. Although there were a few exceptions (notably
   lindane), in general, the data from the two study periods gave similar
   results.},

Title = {Sea Surface Temperature Trends in the Coastal Zone of Southern England},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 9},
Abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) trends along the south coast of England
   (northern English Channel) were examined based on data from systematic
   buoy measurements deployed by the National Network of Regional Coastal
   Monitoring Programmes of England (NNRCMP) since 2003. These data were
   supplemented with: (1) long-term, coastal SST measurements by the Centre
   for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS); (2) global
   data sets compiled by the Hadley Centre since 1900, and (3)
   satellite-derived observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Aqua) since 2002. These data sets were used
   to evaluate de-seasoned nearshore trends in SST along the south coast of
   England and examine links to regional ocean-atmosphere teleconnections.
   The analyses of long-term, CEFAS data support the proposal that prior to
   the mid-1980s there were no de-seasoned trends in SST and conditions
   from year to year were relatively stable. Subsequently, interannual
   fluctuations appear to have increased, associated with a period of
   warming between 1985 and 2003 (0.28 degrees C/decade). Post 2003,
   interannual fluctuations in SST monitored by the NNRCMP buoys continued,
   and the warming trend appears to be greater (0.42 degrees C/decade).
   This trend in SST is greatest in the nearshore and decreases with
   distance offshore. The warming in SST also varied greatly from month to
   month. The greatest warming took place from December to March, whilst
   the least heating (and sometimes cooling) occurred between September and
   November. Analysis of Hadley (HadSST1.1) and MODIS data sets
   substantiated these trends. The greatest warming (post 2003) was found
   west of Portland Bill (up to 0.76 degrees C/decade) and decreased
   towards the Strait of Dover. Despite this west-to-east trend, all 12
   NNRCMP stations between Penzance and Folkestone showed remarkably
   similar results, suggesting regional and global sources of heat rather
   than local sources. This is corroborated through wavelet coherence
   analysis linking SST anomalies to regional/global ocean-atmosphere
   teleconnection indices at seasonal scales.},

Abstract = {Surface weather conditions are closely governed by the large-scale
   circulation of the Earth's atmosphere. Recent increases in the
   occurrence of some extreme weather phenomena(1,2) have led to multiple
   mechanistic hypotheses linking changes in atmospheric circulation to
   increasing probability of extreme events(3-5). However, observed
   evidence of long-term change in atmospheric circulation remains
   inconclusive(6-8). Here we identify statistically significant trends in
   the occurrence of atmospheric circulation patterns, which partially
   explain observed trends in surface temperature extremes over seven
   mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Using self-organizing
   map cluster analysis(9-12), we detect robust circulation pattern trends
   in a subset of these regions during both the satellite observation era
   (1979-2013) and the recent period of rapid Arctic sea-ice decline
   (1990-2013). Particularly substantial influences include the
   contribution of increasing trends in anticyclonic circulations to summer
   and autumn hot extremes over portions of Eurasia and North America, and
   the contribution of increasing trends in northerly flow to winter cold
   extremes over central Asia. Our results indicate that although a
   substantial portion of the observed change in extreme temperature
   occurrence has resulted from regional-and global-scale thermodynamic
   changes, the risk of extreme temperatures over some regions has also
   been altered by recent changes in the frequency, persistence and maximum
   duration of regional circulation patterns.},

Abstract = {This study seeks to investigate the variability and presence of trend in
   the diurnal surface air temperature range (DTR) over North Carolina (NC)
   for the period 1950-2009. The significance trend test and the magnitude
   of trends were determined using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and
   the Theil-Sen approach, respectively. Statewide significant trends (p <
   0.05) of decreasing DTR were found in all seasons and annually during
   the analysis period. Highest (lowest) temporal DTR trends of magnitude
   -0.19 (-0.031) degrees C/decade were found in summer (winter). Potential
   mechanisms for the presence/absence of trend in DTR have been
   highlighted. Historical data sets of the three main moisture components
   (precipitation, total cloud cover (TCC), and soil moisture) and the two
   major atmospheric circulation modes (North Atlantic Oscillation and
   Southern Oscillation) were used for correlation analysis. The DTRs were
   found to be negatively correlated with the precipitation, TCC and soil
   moisture across the state for all the seasons and annual basis. It
   appears that the moisture components related better to the DTR than to
   the atmospheric circulation modes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Temperature data from 29 synoptic stations in Iran for a period of 40
   years (1966-2005) were analyzed to test for the existence of monotonic
   trends and shift changes in the annual, seasonal, and monthly mean air
   temperature series using the Mann-Kendall and Mann-Whitney tests. The
   influences of significant lag-1 serial correlation were eliminated from
   data by the trend-free pre-whitening method prior to the trend analysis.
   The magnitude of the temperature trends was derived from the Theil-Sen's
   slope estimator. It was found that annual mean air temperature increased
   at 25 out of the 29 stations, of which 17 stations showed significant
   monotonic trends. The magnitude of the annual mean air temperature
   trends averagely was (+)0.224A degrees C per decade. Most of the
   stations with the significant positive monotonic trends had a
   significant upward shift change. The analysis indicated that the change
   point year of the significant upward shift changes was 1972 for the
   whole stations except the coastal ones. Moreover, the strongest
   monotonic increasing trends and upward shift changes were observed in
   summer especially in August and September. The spatial analysis of the
   mean air temperature trends revealed the highest numbers of significant
   monotonic trends in the big cities of Iran. These findings provide more
   insights for better understanding of regional temperature behavior in
   the study area.},

Abstract = {The phenology of 78 agricultural and horticultural events from a
   national survey in Germany spanning the years 1951-2004 is examined. The
   majority of events are significantly earlier now than 53 years ago, with
   a mean advance of 1.1-1.3 days per decade. The mean trends for `true
   phases', such as emergence and flowering, of annual and perennial crops
   are not significantly different, although more trends (78\% vs. 46\%)
   are significant for annual crops. We attempt to remove the influence of
   technological advance or altered farming practices on phenology by
   detrending the respective time series by linear regression of date (day
   number) on year. Subsequently, we estimate responses to mean monthly and
   seasonal temperature by correlation and regression in two ways; with and
   without removing the year trend first. Nearly all (97\%) correlation
   coefficients are negative, suggesting earlier events in warmer years.
   Between 82\% and 94\% of the coefficients with seasonal spring and
   summer temperatures are significant. The conservative estimate
   (detrended) of mean temperature response against mean March-May
   temperature (-3.73 days degrees C-1) is significantly less than the full
   estimate (-4.31 days degrees C-1), the `true' size of phenological
   temperature response may lie in between. Perennial crops exhibited a
   significantly higher temperature response to mean spring temperature
   than the annual crops.},

Title = {Effects of orbital decay on satellite-derived lower-tropospheric

Abstract = {The 17-year lower-tropospheric temperature record derived from the
   satellite Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU)(1-3) shows a global cooling
   trend, from 1979 to 1995, of -0.05 K per decade at an altitude of about
   3.5 km (refs 4, 5). Air temperatures measured at the Earth's surface, in
   contrast, have risen by approximately +0.13 K per decade over the same
   period(4,6). The two temperature records are derived from measurements
   of different physical parameters, and thus are not directly comparable.
   In fact, the lower stratosphere is cooling substantially (by about -0.5
   K per decade)(5), so the warming trend seen at the surface is expected
   to diminish with altitude and change into a cooling trend at some point
   in the troposphere. Even so, it has been suggested that the cooling
   trend seen in the satellite data is excessive(4,7,8). The difficulty in
   reconciling the information from these different sources has sparked a
   debate in the climate community about possible instrumental problems and
   the existence of global warming(4,7,9). Here we identify an artificial
   cooling trend in the satellite-derived temperature series caused by
   previously neglected orbital-decay effects. We find a new, corrected
   estimate of +0.07 K per decade for the MSU-based temperature trend,
   which is in closer agreement with surface temperatures. We also find
   that the reported(7) cooling of the lower troposphere, relative to the
   middle troposphere, is another artefact caused by uncorrected
   orbital-decay effects.},

Abstract = {Climate change-induced precipitation unpredictability has disastrous
   consequences for closed basins with sensitive hydrological equilibrium.
   Identifying changes and trends in precipitation characteristics in such
   catchments is an important step towards minimizing potential disasters.
   This study explores the precipitation variability of the Konya Closed
   Basin (Turkey), an over-exploited semi-arid basin. For this purpose,
   monthly precipitation data for the period 1971-2020 (50 years) of 11
   meteorological observation gauges operated by the Turkish State
   Meteorological Service in the basin were utilized. Precipitation data
   were examined using two graphical innovative trend methods namely
   innovative polygon trend analysis (IPTA) and trend polygon star concept
   (TPSC) approaches. With these methods, periodic features in monthly
   precipitation data and trend transitions between months can be
   interpreted visually and linguistically. IPTA and TPSC methods were
   applied separately to both arithmetic mean data and standard deviation
   for each month's precipitation data of 11 stations. A general increasing
   trend in precipitation was obtained in most of the months for the
   stations used in the IPTA application. Most of the TPSC arrows, which
   were distributed throughout all four regions for both the arithmetic
   mean and standard deviation, were in the I and III regions. Based on the
   TPSC graphs, the longest transition arrows between two consecutives
   occurred in the first months of autumn (highly increasing) and summer
   (highly decreasing) in most of the stations. The results of this study
   are of great importance for the policies to be sustained regarding the
   ongoing climate change in the agricultural sector in KCB, which is both
   a water scarce basin and a region with intensive agricultural
   activities.},

Abstract = {Climate systems have both nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics,
   and it is important to develop methods to reveal the nonlinear trends in
   these systems. Based on synthetic data with known signals and a
   precipitation anomaly time series from 74 meteorological stations in an
   arid region of northwest China (ARNC) from 1960 to 2015, the latest
   extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) and ensemble empirical
   mode decomposition (EEMD) methods were employed to conduct multi-scale
   mode decomposition. The results showed that both the ESMD and EEMD
   methods can separate synthetic signals and extract the nonlinear trends
   of precipitation in ARNC and can thus provide reliable decomposition
   results. This article employed the ESMD method to analyse the spatial
   and temporal variation features of nonlinear precipitation trends in
   ARNC from 1960 to 2015. The results indicated that over the past 50+
   years, the overall precipitation in ARNC has exhibited an apparent
   nonlinear upwards trend. In addition, its changes have exhibited
   oscillation periods of 3, 6, and 11 years. The periods of the three
   components are significant (p < 0.05), and the variance contribution
   rate of the first intrinsic mode function (IMF1) is the largest,
   reaching 58\%. Furthermore, there are obvious spatial differences in the
   nonlinear trends of average annual precipitation: northern Xinjiang has

Title = {Sea Surface Temperature Trends in Venice Lagoon and the Adjacent Waters},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},

Pages = {385-395},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Two coastal lagoons and coastal waters in the northern Adriatic region,
   Italy, were examined to assess the anthropogenic impact on coastal sea
   surface temperature (SST). The first lagoon was the highly altered
   Venice lagoon, and the second was the largely natural Marano-Grado
   lagoon. There are converging lines of evidence for air warming in the
   Venice region since 1910 at a long-term rate of 0.095 degrees C/decade.
   Since 1980, the warming has accelerated to 0.65 degrees C/decade in the
   centre of Venice. The acceleration in air warming is also evident in the
   MOHAT4 data set from the northern Adriatic Sea, although the rate of
   warming is less (0.36 degrees C/decade). This warming trend is mimicked
   in the HadISST1.1 data set of SST for the northern Adriatic Sea (0.33
   degrees C/decade), whereas no trend was detected before 1980. SST and
   air temperature in both Venice and Marano-Grado lagoons are highly
   correlated (r(2) = 0.8): SST is on average 2 degrees C cooler than the
   northern Adriatic Sea is, although differences appear to be diminishing
   because of rapid warming in Venice lagoon since 2008 (up to 1.75 degrees
   C/decade). The warming in the lagoons appears to be greatest during
   winter months. By contrast, the greatest (post-1980) warming in the
   northern Adriatic Sea occurs during summer months. Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (nighttime; MODIS) SST data shows that, on
   average, the Venice lagoon is 5\% warmer than Marano-Grado lagoon is.
   This equates to a summertime mean temperature difference of 1.2 degrees
   C. This difference is within the scatter of the data and suggests that
   there is no appreciable heat retention in the waters of the Venice
   lagoon because of local anthropogenic activity.},

Title = {Consistency of modelled and observed temperature trends in the tropical

Abstract = {A recent report of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP)
   identified a `potentially serious inconsistency' between modelled and
   observed trends in tropical lapse rates (Karl et al., 2006). Early
   versions of Satellite and radiosonde datasets suggested that the
   tropical surface had warmed more than the troposphere, while climate
   models consistently showed tropospheric amplification of surface warming
   in response to human-caused increases in well-mixed greenhouse gases
   (GHGs). We revisit such comparisons here using new observational
   estimates of surface and tropospheric temperature changes. We find that
   there is no longer a serious discrepancy between modelled and observed
   trends in tropical lapse rates.
   This emerging reconciliation of models and observations has two primary
   explanations. First, because of changes in the treatment of buoy and
   satellite information, new surface temperature datasets yield slightly
   reduced tropical warming relative to earlier versions. Second, recently
   developed satellite and radiosonde datasets show larger warming of the
   tropical lower troposphere. In the case of a new satellite dataset from
   Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), enhanced warming is due to an improved
   procedure of adjusting for inter-satellite biases. When the RSS-derived
   tropospheric temperature trend is compared with four different observed
   estimates of surface temperature change, the surface warming is
   invariably amplified in the tropical troposphere, consistent with model
   results. Even if we use data from a second satellite dataset with
   smaller tropospheric warming than in RSS, observed tropical lapse rate
   trends are not significantly different from those in all other model
   simulations.
   Our results contradict a recent claim that all simulated temperature
   trends in the tropical troposphere and in tropical lapse rates are
   inconsistent with observations. This claim was based on use of older
   radiosonde and satellite datasets, and on two methodological errors: the
   neglect of observational trend uncertainties introduced by interannual
   climate variability, and application of an inappropriate statistical
   `consistency test'. Copyright (c) 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Estimates of trends of climatic changes at basin and state scales are
   required for developing adaptation strategies related to planning,
   development and management of water resources. In the present study,
   seasonal and annual trends of changes in maximum temperature (T-max),
   minimum temperature (T-min), mean temperature (T-mean), temperature
   range (T-range), highest maximum temperature (H-max) and lowest minimum
   temperature (L-min) have been examined at the basin scale. The longest
   available records over the last century, for 43 stations covering nine
   river basins in northwest and central India, were used in the analysis.
   Of the nine river basins studied, seven showed a warming trend, whereas
   two showed a cooling trend. The Narmada and Sabarmati river basins
   experienced the maximum warming and cooling, respectively. The majority
   of basins in the study area show increasing trend in T-range, H-max and
   L-min. Seasonal analysis of different variables shows that the greatest
   changes in T-max and T-mean were observed in the post-monsoon season,
   while T-min experienced the greatest change in the monsoon season. This
   analysis provides scenarios of temperature changes which may be used for
   sensitivity analysis of water availability for different basins, and
   accordingly in planning and implementation of adaptation strategies.},

Pages = {159-169},

Abstract = {With mounting evidence that global warming is taking place, the cause of
   this warming has come under vigorous scrutiny. Recent studies have lead
   to a debate over what contributes the most to regional temperature
   changes. We investigated air temperature patterns in California from
   1950 to 2000. Statistical analyses were used to test the significance of
   temperature trends in California subregions in an attempt to clarify the
   spatial and temporal patterns of the occurrence and intensities of
   warming. Most regions showed a stronger increase in minimum temperatures
   than with mean and maximum temperatures. Areas of intensive urbanization
   showed the largest positive trends, while rural, non-agricultural
   regions showed the least warming. Strong correlations between
   temperatures and Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) particularly
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) values, also account for temperature
   variability throughout the state. The analysis of 331 state weather
   stations associated a number of factors with temperature trends,
   including urbanization, population, Pacific oceanic conditions and
   elevation. Using climatic division mean temperature trends, the state
   had an average warming of 0.99 degrees C (1.79 degrees F) over the
   1950-2000 period, or 0.20 degrees C (0.36 degrees F) decade. Southern
   California had the highest rates of warming, while the NE Interior
   Basins division experienced cooling. Large urban sites showed rates over
   twice those for the state, for the mean maximum temperatures, and over 5
   times the state's mean rate for the minimum temperatures. In comparison,
   irrigated cropland sites warmed about 0.13 degrees C decade(-1)
   annually, but near 0.40 degrees C for summer and fall minima. Offshore
   Pacific SSTs warmed 0.09 degrees C decade(-1) for the study period.},

Abstract = {Data from the two ESA satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 are used in global and
   regional analysis of sea level and sea surface temperature trends over
   the last, 7.8 years. T he ERS satellites and in the future the ENVISAT
   satellite provide unique opportunity for monitoring both changes in sea
   level and sea surface temperature as these satellites are equipped with
   an altimeter to measure sea level height as well as an along track
   scanning radiometer (ATSR) to measure the sea surface temperature.
   Consistent increase in both sea level and sea surface temperatures are
   found in most parts of the Atlantic Ocean over this period. In the
   Indian Ocean and particularly the Pacific Ocean the trends in both sea
   level and temperature are still dominated by the large changes
   associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation. In terms of
   contribution to the total global sea level change, the contribution of
   the central Pacific Ocean is as large as the contribution of the whole
   North Atlantic.
   The regional changes detected by ERS sea level and sea surface
   temperature observations are highly correlated with independent finding
   from TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) sea level observations and the Reynolds
   advanced very high resolution radiometer (AV-HRR) sea surface
   temperature observations. Global averaged spatial correlations between
   the 50degrees parallels are 0.87 between the ATSR and AVHRR based sea
   surface temperature trends-values, and 0.85 between the UP and ERS
   altimetric sea level trends. The spatial correlation between the ERS
   derived sea level change and sea surface temperature is 0.42 for both
   the ATSR and AVHRR derived data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {Observed trends in the magnitude and persistence of monthly temperature
   variability},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 19},
Abstract = {Climate variability is critically important for nature and society,
   especially if it increases in amplitude and/or fluctuations become more
   persistent. However, the issues of whether climate variability is
   changing, and if so, whether this is due to anthropogenic forcing, are
   subjects of ongoing debate. Increases in the amplitude and persistence
   of temperature fluctuations have been detected in some regions, e.g. the
   North Pacific, but there is no agreed global signal. Here we
   systematically scan monthly surface temperature indices and spatial
   datasets to look for trends in variance and autocorrelation
   (persistence). We show that monthly temperature variability and
   autocorrelation increased over 1957-2002 across large parts of the North
   Pacific, North Atlantic, North America and the Mediterranean.
   Furthermore, (multi) decadal internal climate variability appears to
   influence trends in monthly temperature variability and autocorrelation.
   Historically-forced climate models do not reproduce the observed trends
   in temperature variance and autocorrelation, consistent with the models
   poorly capturing (multi) decadal internal climate variability. Based on
   a review of established spatial correlations and corresponding
   mechanistic `teleconnections' we hypothesise that observed slowing down
   of sea surface temperature variability contributed to observed increases
   in land temperature variability and autocorrelation, which in turn
   contributed to persistent droughts in North America and the
   Mediterranean.},

Abstract = {Based on daily maximum and minimum temperature records at 78
   meteorological stations in the Basin of China's largest fresh water lake
   (Poyang Lake Basin), the temporal and spatial variability of 11 extreme
   temperature indices are investigated for the period 1959-2010. The
   analysis indicates that the annual mean of daily minimum temperature
   (T-min) has increased significantly, while no significant trends were
   observed in the annual mean of daily maximum temperature (T-max),
   resulting in a significant decrease in the diurnal temperature range.
   Trends and percentages of stations with significant trends in
   T-min-related indices are generally stronger and higher than those in
   T-max-related indices; however, no significant trends can be found in
   T-max-related indices (TXMean, TX90p, TXx and TX10p) at both seasonal
   and annual time scale. Low correlations with Global-SST ENSO index are
   also detected in T-max-related indices. Significant positive
   relationships can be found in T-min-related indices (TNMean, TNx, TNn
   and TN90p), however, the most significant negative coefficient was also
   found in cold nights (TN10p) with the Global-SST ENSO index. Singular
   value decomposition (SVD) correlating extreme temperatures over the
   Poyang Lake Basin and the North Pacific SST indicates the East China
   Sea, Western Pacific and Bering Sea to be stronger linked with T-min
   than T-max with the first mode (SVD-1) explaining 90 and 94 \% of annual
   T-max and T-min respectively.},

Abstract = {Instrumental temperature estimates for the land and marine regions of
   the world show a warming of the annual mean since 1861 of 0.6 degreesC.
   The warming has not occurred linearly, but in two periods, 1915-40 and
   since 1975. The 1990s is the warmest decade since comparable records
   began in the 1860s and 1998 the warmest year. Overall, the warming is of
   the same magnitude in both hemispheres. Earlier instrumental
   temperatures are available in some regions of the world, particularly
   Europe. Here, temperatures during the late-17(th) century were about 1
   degreesC cooler than 1990s levels, values confirmed by totally
   independent measurements from boreholes. Longer series, of various
   combinations of proxy temperature indicators (from natural and written
   archives of the past), show the 20(th) century was the warmest century
   in the last millennium. The coolest centuries were the 17(th) and the
   19(th), with the coldest decades, 1601-10, 1691-1700 and 1811-20, each
   being about 0.7 degreesC below the 1961-90 average. About half the
   decadal-scale variance can be explained by changes in solar irradiance
   and volcanism. Anthropogenic factors (greenhouse gases) need to be
   invoked to explain the dramatic increases during the 20(th) century.},

Abstract = {The trend analysis approach is adopted for the prediction of future
   climatological behavior and climate change impact on agriculture, the
   environment, and water resources. In this study, the innovative trend
   pivot analysis method (ITPAM) and trend polygon star concept method were
   applied for precipitation trend detection at 11 stations located in the
   Soan River basin (SRB), Potohar region, Pakistan. Polygon graphics of
   total monthly precipitation data were created and trends length and
   slope were calculated separately for arithmetic mean and standard
   deviation. As a result, the innovative methods produced useful
   scientific information and helped in identifying, interpreting, and
   calculating monthly shifts under different trend behaviors, that is,
   increase in some stations and decrease in others of precipitation data.
   This increasing and decreasing variability emerges from climate change.
   The risk graphs of the total monthly precipitation and monthly polygonal
   trends appear to show changes in the trend of meteorological data in the
   Potohar region of Pakistan. The monsoonal rainfall of all stations shows
   a complex nature of behavior, and monthly distribution is uneven. There
   is a decreasing trend of rainfall in high land stations of SRB with a
   significant change between the first dataset and the second dataset in
   July and August. It was examined that monsoon rainfall is increasing in
   lowland stations indicating a shifting pattern of monsoonal rainfall
   from highland to lowland areas of SRB. The increasing and decreasing
   trends in different periods with evidence of seasonal variations may
   cause irregular behavior in the water resources and agricultural
   sectors. Significance StatementThe monthly polygonal trends with risk
   graphs of total monthly precipitation data depicted a clear picture of
   climate change effects in the Potohar region of Pakistan. The monsoonal
   rainfall showed a significant decreasing trend in highland stations and
   an increasing trend in lowland stations, indicating a shifting pattern
   of monsoonal rainfall from highland to lowland areas.},

Abstract = {The amount of winter precipitation in Japan is increasing only in the
   Kanto-Koshin region, which includes the Tokyo metropolitan area located
   on the Pacific Ocean side of Japan. This study investigated long-term
   historical changes in winter precipitation in Japan using a large
   ensemble of regional climate simulations that capture the observed
   increases in precipitation in the Kanto-Koshin region. In addition,
   self-organizing maps (SOMs) were applied to the atmospheric pressure to
   explore historical changes in weather pattern (WP) leading to
   precipitation. The results suggest that long-term changes in
   precipitation/snowfall could be due to differences in the WP frequency
   of southern-coastal cyclones and WP-related precipitation due to altered
   background states during the winter. The former and latter can be
   interpreted as dynamic and thermodynamic impacts of historical climate
   change. As for the Kanto-Koshin region, atmospheric circulation analogs
   revealed that thermodynamic and dynamic effects account for similar to
   2/3 and similar to 1/3 of the precipitation changes, respectively, while
   dynamic effects (increases in south coast cyclone occurrence) dominantly
   account for snowfall changes. These changes could be attributed to the
   large-scale historical increases in air temperature and water vapor

   days/decade) and cool days (TXx: -0.86 days/decade) was detected in the
   past 52 years. Moreover, the trend magnitudes in cold/warm nights are
   larger than those in cold/warm days, which indicate that trends in
   minimum temperature extremes are more rapid than trends in maximum
   temperature extremes, consistent with a long-term decrease in DTR. The
   other indices, including TNn, TNx, SU25, TR20, FD0, ID0, GSL, and DTR,
   show statistically significant changes except for Maximum and minimum
   values of maximum daily temperatures (TXx and TXn) which have
   statistically insignificant slopes at individual stations and in
   regional mean trend. For the majority of stations, significant increases
   are detected for heat related extremes such as summer days and tropical
   nights (SU25 and TR20) as well as for maximum and minimum values of
   minimum daily temperatures (TNn and TNx); With the exception of diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) and maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx), the
   other indices strongly correlate with annual mean temperature. In
   addition, there are high correlations among warm indices and among cold
   ones, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

Title = {Trends in seasonal surface air temperature in mainland Portugal, since
   1941},

Abstract = {This study provides a thorough assessment of recent changes in
   near-surface air temperature in mainland Portugal at both the local and
   regional level, focusing on extreme events (maximum and minimum) at a
   seasonal scale. It examines trends in selected specific indices that are
   calculated from daily air temperature data from 23 measuring stations
   scattered across the territory, recorded between 1941 and 2006. The
   results show overall warming trends over mainland Portugal that are
   consistent with the dominant global warming and reflect an increase in
   both maximum and minimum air temperature. When we split the study period
   into two sub-periods, 1945-1975 and 1976-2006, the partial trend
   analysis reveals that the first sub-period is mostly characterized by
   cooling followed by an even stronger tendency towards warmer benchmarks
   in all the indices evaluated, in particular for the warm-related
   temperature extremes in spring and summer.
   The changes observed in seasonal patterns confirm the well-known
   asymmetries in the climate in mainland Portugal and suggest that they
   are likely to be aggravated. There are changes associated with extreme
   temperatures, in particular, the significant increase in the frequency
   and duration of heat waves, and the increase in the frequency of hot
   days and tropical nights, especially in spring and summer; moreover
   there is a significant decrease in the frequency of cold waves and frost
   days.
   Teleconnections associated with changing patterns of temperature are
   also investigated. The results show that, over mainland Portugal,
   cold-related air temperature extremes have been associated with the East
   Atlantic mode in autumn, whereas warm-related extremes have been
   associated with the Scandinavia teleconnection pattern in spring, summer
   and autumn. However, the most prominent Northern Hemisphere pattern, the
   North Atlantic Oscillation, exerts limited influence, which is felt
   mostly in winter and spring.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal pattern of sub-daily temperature change in
   mainland China was analysed for the period from 1973 to 2011 using a
   3-hourly dataset based on 408 stations. The increase in surface air
   temperature was more significant by night between 1973 and 1992, with
   the fastest upward trend around local midnight being about 0.27 degrees
   C/decade, while it was more significant by day between 1992 and 2011,
   with the fastest upward trend being about 0.46 degrees C/decade in
   mid-late morning. The season with rapid temperature increase also
   shifted from winter in 1973-1992 (the largest increase happened near
   midnight in December, 0.75 degrees C/decade) to spring in 1992-2011 (the
   largest increase happened at in the early afternoon in March, 0.82
   degrees C/decade). The change in the spatial distributions of the
   sub-daily temperature trends shows that Northeast China warmed more
   significantly in 1973-1992 than elsewhere, but it cooled in 1992-2011,
   when Southwest China was the new focus of temperature increase whereas
   it had previously been cooling. A preliminary analysis of the possible
   causes implies that changes in solar radiation, cloud cover, aerosols
   and the observational environments near the stations might have
   contributed to these observed temperature changes.},

   records},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {64},

Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Long-term historical air temperature records of four stations from
   Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily are analyzed in this study.
   By applying detrended fluctuation analysis of the second order to the
   monthly anomalies, different long-term correlations are found in
   different time periods at both the maximum and minimum temperatures,
   which indicate the existence of internal stochastic trend. By generating
   surrogate data with the same long-term correlations and data length,
   internal stochastic trends are estimated with confidence probability
   intervals of 95\% and 99\% provided. We find the longer data length, the
   shorter confidence probability interval we have; the stronger long-term
   correlation, the wider confidence probability interval is obtained. By
   comparing the temperature trends observed from the historical
   temperature records with the corresponding confidence probability
   intervals of the internal stochastic trends, significant external trends
   can be detected. We find that except for the maximum temperature in
   SAGINAW MBS INTL AP, temperatures from the four stations all show
   significant external trends when long historical data (> 1 0 0 years)
   are considered. However, if only the past 30 years are taken into
   account, the observed trends are still not strong enough to exceed the
   confidence probability interval. Although we cannot exclude the
   existence of external trends, considering the possible influence from
   internal stochastic trends, the external trends are not significant.
   From this detection method, we can judge, in the context of global
   warming, whether an observed trend is significantly induced by external
   forcing. Therefore, it is useful for our further study targeting the
   internal (external) climatic impact factors.},

Abstract = {The information on the projected climate changes over China is of great
   importance for preparing the nation's societal adaptiveness to the
   future natural ecosystem. This study reports the surface mean
   temperature changes during 2014-2100 over China and its four sub-regions
   (Northern China, Northwestern China, Southern China, and the Tibetan
   Plateau) by analyzing 20 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) under three Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP)
   scenarios: SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585. The multi-model ensemble mean
   (MMEM) of 20 CMIP6 models has cold biases over China during 1979-2014,
   with improved performance compared with the CMIP5 models. In contrast,
   the CMIP6 models simulate well in the spatial climatology with lower
   warming rates over China. Relative to 1986-2005, the regionally averaged
   surface mean temperatures from the MMEM over China under SSP126, SSP245,
   SSP585 scenarios are projected to increase by 1.31 degrees C, 1.32
   degrees C, 1.45 degrees C in the near-term (2021-2040), 1.75 degrees C,
   2.06 degrees C, 2.66 degrees C in the mid-term (2041-2060), and 1.08
   degrees C, 2.97 degrees C, 5.62 degrees C in the long-term (2081-2100),
   respectively. The CMIP6 models simulate accelerated warming occurs over
   the Northwestern China and the Tibetan Plateau, suggesting that the arid
   and semi-arid regions are particularly sensitive to future climate
   warming. We quantify uncertainty for future projections of temperature
   changes over China, and the main sources of uncertainty are model and
   scenario uncertainty particularly for the regions with the largest cold
   bias. This suggests that the observational constraints on these regions
   will lead to significant improvements for climatic projections over
   China.},

Abstract = {The Banda Sea region is one of the locations in Indonesian waters that
   have high Coastal Upwelling intensity which related to the monsoon
   pattern. The calculation of Upwelling Index (UI) based on Wind data show
   that the peak coastal upwelling is from June to September. Analysis of
   SST trends was carried out in the July-September period based on NOAA
   OISST data from 1982-2017. The results show that there are differences
   in the value of SST trends that occur in the Coastal and Oceanic
   regions. In general, the SST trend in the Banda Sea waters has a
   positive value (warming) in both the coastal and ocean areas. While the
   UI trend in coastal and oceanic regions in the Banda Sea tends to
   decline from the 1982-2017 period. This condition shows that external
   factors quite influence oceanographic conditions in Banda Sea waters. It
   is also thought to have caused a decrease in the intensity of the
   upwelling trend found in the Banda Sea. The results show that the SST
   trend in the Banda Sea tends to increase during the peak upwelling
   season (June-September). Meanwhile, the Upwelling intensity trend shows
   a decreasing pattern which is also confirmed by decreasing trend in
   chlorophyll concentration.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the land surface has warmed substantially more than
   the ocean surface, and relative humidity has fallen over land. Amplified
   warming and declining relative humidity over land are also dominant
   features of future climate projections, with implications for
   climate-change impacts. An emerging body of research has shown how
   constraints from atmospheric dynamics and moisture budgets are important
   for projected future land-ocean contrasts, but these ideas have not been
   used to investigate temperature and humidity records over recent
   decades. Here we show how both the temperature and humidity changes
   observed over land between 1979 and 2016 are linked to warming over
   neighboring oceans. A simple analytical theory, based on atmospheric
   dynamics and moisture transport, predicts equal changes in moist static
   energy over land and ocean and equal fractional changes in specific
   humidity over land and ocean. The theory is shown to be consistent with
   the observed trends in land temperature and humidity given the warming
   over ocean. Amplified land warming is needed for the increase in moist
   static energy over drier land to match that over ocean, and land
   relative humidity decreases because land specific humidity is linked via
   moisture transport to the weaker warming over ocean. However, there is
   considerable variability about the best-fit trend in land relative
   humidity that requires further investigation and which may be related to
   factors such as changes in atmospheric circulations and land-surface
   properties.},

Abstract = {Minimum and maximum soil surface temperatures have shown significant
   warming trends since the midtwentieth century in China, with minimum
   temperatures rising at a faster pace than maximums, resulting in a
   decrease in the soil surface diurnal temperature range. Similar to air
   temperature, these changes demonstrate spatial coherence, with regions
   at higher latitudes experiencing relatively more change. While increases
   in air temperatures in China slowed after 1998, paralleling the global
   ``warming hiatus,{''} soil temperatures at the surface and in shallow
   layers have continued to rise across China. The increases in soil
   surface temperatures are fastest at night since 1998, reducing the soil
   surface diurnal temperature range. Thus, we find that while the decrease
   in the diurnal air temperature range mainly happened during the earlier
   ``dimming{''} period ending around 1988, the decrease in the diurnal
   soil surface temperature range is detectable only during the renewed
   dimming period after 1998. This has caused soil temperatures at the
   surface and in shallow layers to diverge from air temperatures since
   1998. Although changes in soil temperatures were associated with changes
   in air temperature, the patterns of change are different. Calculations
   using only nonurban stations show similar warming rates, indicating that
   the effects of urbanization are small.},

Abstract = {In order to study the periodicity variation and trend prediction of
   temperature in Yaoba Oasis, based on the temperature data from 1955 to
   2012 of Barunbieli weather station, linear trend method, Mann-Kendall
   test and wavelet analysis were used to analyze the trend, mutation point
   and periodicity. The results showed that the temperature had a
   significantly warming trend nearly 60 years in Yaoba Oasis while there
   was one mutation point at 1986. The temperature had short periodicities
   of 4 and 9 years, so it would increase from 2016 to 2020 that it was
   closely related to the background of the global climate warming trend.
   This paper not only provided a scientific basis of the future short-term
   temperature change for Yaoba Oasis but also provided a theoretical
   reference for the local agricultural production.},

Title = {Detecting soil temperature trends in Northeast Iran from 1993 to 2016},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {177-192},

Abstract = {Soil temperature is a fundamental agrometeorological variable which has
   a measureable influence on the development of plants. A comprehensive
   analysis of daily soil temperature trends at predetermined depths can
   provide a quantitative understanding for the sustainable management of
   agricultural systems, such as mitigating the adverse effects of
   anticipated temperature stress, supporting confidence levels of ideal
   seed sowing dates, as well as irrigation treatment durations and
   intervals. In this paper, daily soil temperature trends were analyzed
   (using the Mann-Kendall test) at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 and 100 cm
   at seven discrete meteorological stations located throughout
   northeastern Iran during a consecutive period from 1993 to 2016. The
   results of this research indicate that in most of the study stations
   there exists a non-significant negative trend in soil temperature in the
   first half of January and also in the second half of December; these
   trends become significant as the soil gets deeper. For the warmer months
   of the year, especially from April to the end of August, soil
   temperature trends are positive and significant (or near significant)
   and these positive trends are of greater significance with a
   corresponding increase in soil depth. Agri-environmental agencies and
   practitioners may benefit from the approach used in this research (i.e.
   using the Mann-Kendall test to analyze trends in daily soil temperature
   time series) since it is an easily transferable approach that can
   provide a comprehensive geospatial and temporal analysis of crop and
   plant patterns in different regions and environmental conditions.
   Additionally, farmers may use daily soil temperature trends as a means
   to encourage the protection and mitigation of a variety of projected
   environmental stresses, such as water scarcity, irrigation demands,
   seasonal temperature fluctuations, and redundant crop rotation.},

Abstract = {Monthly, seasonal and annual trends in mean temperatures have been
   analysed in this study using data from 37 weather stations from the
   Pakistan Meteorological Department with records from 1952 to 2009.
   Statistical tests including Sen's slope and Mann-Kendall were applied to
   each of the 37 stations in order to determine the sign and slopes of
   trends and their statistical significance. The study reveals that the
   temperature has generally increased in Pakistan at all time scales
   analysed over the past few decades. March and the pre-monsoon season
   were the periods with the highest number of weather stations showing
   statistical significance, and also with the highest magnitudes of
   trends. Mean annual temperature increased around 0.36 degrees C/decade.
   This rise in temperature is slightly higher than other results found for
   Pakistan. The association between temperatures and certain
   teleconnection patterns, as well as the influence of the urban effect,
   might be among the causes of the trends found in this study. The largest
   number of correlations between mean temperatures and teleconnection
   patterns was found in March, April and May with NAO, ENSO and NCP,
   respectively. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) may also have an
   influence on the temperatures of certain months in the monsoon season
   and particularly in August. At a seasonal resolution, NAO and NCP may
   control temperatures in the pre-monsoon season. The lowest number of
   sites exhibiting correlations was found in winter and in the
   post-monsoon seasons. Copyright (C) 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {In the past few decades, many studies showed a significant worldwide
   warming, and consequently, changes in frequency and persistence of
   extreme high-temperature events were observed. In order to analyse
   summer Tuscany (Italy) patterns of climate change during the period
   1955-2004, indices of temperature and of extreme events were
   investigated for evidence of trend and change in inter-annual
   variability by using data of 40 weather stations. Least square
   regression analysis and Theil-Sen nonparametric regression were applied
   for evidence of trends. The Mann-Kendall test was applied to each time
   series to look for statistically significant trends.
   The results showed a general increase in minimum and maximum
   temperatures and extreme temperature events. Maximum temperature
   increase (+0.44 degrees C/decade) was slightly greater than minimum
   temperature (+0.38 degrees C/decade) and consequently, an increase in
   summer daily temperature range (DTR) was noted (+0.06 degrees C/decade).
   Inter-annual summer climate variability showed an increasing trend in
   the whole region, especially in regard to extreme event occurrences
   while a small decreasing trend concerning diurnal temperature range was
   observed. Copyright (c) 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {The problems inherent in the estimation of global tropospheric
   temperature trends from a combination of near-nadir Microwave Sounding
   Unit (MSU) channel-2 and 4 data are described. The authors show that
   insufficient overlap between those two channels' weighting functions
   prevents a physical removal of the stratospheric influence on
   tropospheric channel 2 from the stratospheric channel 4. Instead.
   correlations between stratospheric and tropospheric temperature
   fluctuations based upon ancillary (e.g., radiosonde) information call be
   used to statistically estimate a correction for the stratospheric
   influence on MSU 2 from MSU 4. Fu et al. developed such a regression
   relationship from radiosonde data using the 850-300-hPa layer as the
   target predictand. There are large errors in the resulting fit of the
   two MSU channels to the tropospheric target layer, so the correlations
   from the ancillary data Must be relied upon to provide a statistical
   minimization of the resulting errors. Such relationships depend upon the
   accuracy of the particular training dataset as well as the dataset time
   period and its global representativeness (i.e.. temporal and spatial
   stationarity of the statistics). It is concluded that near-nadir MSU
   channels 2 and 4 cannot be combined to provide a tropospheric
   temperature measure without substantial uncertainty resulting from a
   necessary dependence oil ancillary information regarding the vertical
   profile of temperature variations. which are, in general, not well known
   oil a global basis.},

Abstract = {The month-to-month variability of tropical temperatures is larger in the
   troposphere than at Earth's surface. This amplification behavior is
   similar in a range of observations and climate model simulations and is
   consistent with basic theory. On multidecadal time scales, tropospheric
   amplification of surface warming is a robust feature of model
   simulations, but it occurs in only one observational data set. Other
   observations show weak, or even negative, amplification. These results
   suggest either that different physical mechanisms control amplification
   processes on monthly and decadal time scales, and models fail to capture
   such behavior or (more plausibly) that residual errors in several
   observational data sets used here affect their representation of
   long-term trends.},

Journal = {DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Agriculture in Ethiopia is highly dictated by spatial patterns and
   temporal distributions of climate variables. The analysis of these
   climate variables is crucial for understanding the impacts on
   agricultural productivity. This study aimed to analyze spatiotemporal
   variability and trends of intra-seasonal rainfall and temperature using
   site-specific daily data from the Ethiopian Meteorology Institute
   (1992-2021). Standardized methods explore variability, while
   Mann-Kendall tests identify trends, using the Modified version for data
   with autocorrelation. Inverse Distance Weighted interpolation was
   employed for spatial analysis of rainfall, length of growing season, and
   temperature. The findings identified that Kiremt dominated the
   mono-modal rainfall pattern, contributing 72\%-86\% of total annual
   rainfall. The study found that the season typically begins early on June
   13 in Adiszemen, and July 6 in Arbgebiya and ends between October 6 and
   October 26. The duration of the season varied across locations,
   averaging 95 days at Ebenat and 148 days at Adiszemen. The seasonal
   rainfall anomaly index shows identical patterns between ENSO episodes
   and seasonal rainfall. These findings inform decision-making and
   adaptation strategies for ENSO-driven rainfall variability. Temperatures
   showed predictable seasonal patterns, but have significantly increased
   over time, with maximum and minimum temperatures rising 0.014 degrees C
   to 0.421 degrees C and 0.027 degrees C to 0.485 degrees C per year
   respectively. This warming trend is negatively impacting water, crops,
   and livestock, requiring adaptation measures to build regional
   resilience. This study underscores the critical impact of climate
   variability on agriculture in the study area. The findings reveal shifts
   in rainfall patterns and temperature trends, providing essential
   insights for adapting agricultural practices.},

Abstract = {Climate variability is of global interest due to its socioeconomic and
   environmental effects on the world's population. In Colombia,
   temperature changes affect food security, especially for the most
   vulnerable people in the Caribbean region. We analyzed monthly air
   temperature in northeastern Colombia (Cesar, La Guaji-ra, and Magdalena
   departments). We reconstructed time series with missing data using
   nonlinear principal component analysis. Subsequently, temporal
   variability, associations with events of climatic variability, and
   temporal trends were evaluated. Periodicity analyses indicate the
   dominance of annual variability, although statistically significant
   associations with periods between 3 and 7 years show the influence of El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The Spearman correlation
   coefficient with N = 360 and 95\% significance shows a better
   association with the Multivariate ENSO Index (rsp mean = 0.38) and the
   Southern Oscillation Index (rsp mean = -0.32). The multi-year monthly
   analysis shows positive trends, with maximum values between March (1.04
   degrees C month-1), and June (1.07 degrees C month-1) in the valley of
   the Cesar department, and a minimum in March, at the northernmost La
   Guajira (0.2 degrees C month-1).},

Abstract = {The rising intensity and frequency of extreme temperature events are
   caused due to climate change and are likely to affect the entire world.
   In this context, the Himalayas are reported to be very sensitive to
   changes in temperature extremes. In this study, we investigate the
   variability of temperature extremes over the Northwest Himalayas in the
   early 21st century (2000-2018). Here, we used 14 temperature indices
   recommended by ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and
   Indices). The present study reveals the trends of extreme temperature
   indices on the spatial scale for the western part of the Northwest
   Himalayas. The 14 temperature indices were used to assess the behavior
   of extreme temperature trends with their significance. This study
   reports that the northwestern region of the study area has a cooling
   effect due to an increase in the trends of cold spells, cold
   days/nights, and frost days, while the southwestern region significantly
   shows the warming effects due to the increasing trends in warm spells,
   warm days/nights, and summer days. On the other hand, the eastern region
   of the study area shows mixed behavior, i.e., some places show warm
   effects while some reveal cold effects in the early 21st century.
   Overall, this study implies the northwestern parts have cooling trends
   while the southwestern and southeastern parts have warming trends during
   the early 21st century.},

Abstract = {The Adirondack Park in upstate New York is renowned for its strict land
   use laws aimed at preserving the pristine condition of its lakes.
   However, anthropogenic impacts continue to pose threats to lake health.
   This study investigates the health of selected Adirondack lakes by
   analyzing extensive field data collected in the late 1970s and 1980s,
   primarily focusing on lake acidification caused by coal plant emissions.
   Ongoing concerns regarding algal blooms, rising temperatures, and other
   threats necessitate a comprehensive understanding of climatological
   changes in the region. Remote sensing observations from multiple
   satellites, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) and Landsat series, are utilized to monitor lake health over
   long periods of time. This study explores the capabilities and usage of
   these satellites to assess land and lake surface parameters. By
   extracting satellite data, seasonal statistics are analyzed to uncover
   trends in lake temperature and seasonality. The findings highlight the
   importance of remote sensing in retrospectively measuring all seasons,
   identifying significant warming rates, and emphasizing the need for in
   situ measurements to validate satellite products and preserve the health
   of lakes within the Adirondack region.},

Abstract = {Record of long-term land temperature changes remains ephemeral,
   discontinuous, and isolated, thus leaving the common view that
   Pleistocene land temperature evolution should have followed ocean
   temperatures unconfirmed. Here, we present a continuous land surface
   temperature reconstruction in the Asian monsoon region over the past 3.0
   Myr based on the distribution of soil bacterial lipids from the Chinese
   Loess Plateau. The land temperature record indicates an unexpected
   warming trend over the Pleistocene, which is opposite to the cooling
   trend in Pleistocene ocean temperatures, resulting in increased land-sea
   thermal contrast. We propose that the previously unrecognized increase
   of land-sea thermal contrast during much of the Pleistocene is a
   regional climate phenomenon that provides a likely mechanism in favor of
   the long-term enhancement of the Pleistocene East Asian summer monsoon.},

Title = {Temperature Trend Analysis and Investigation on a Case of Variability
   Climate},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change is now evident on a global scale. In some regions, the
   phenomenon is especially amplified, generating different consequences
   for man and the environment. Sicily is one of the Mediterranean regions,
   the biggest in terms of area, where climatic variations produce
   significant effects. In this study, temperature trends on monthly time
   scales are examined in the time frame 1925-2015. The cluster analysis
   technique (Ward's method) was used to homogenize the temperature series.
   The results show four statistically significant clusters, confirming the
   presence of climatic variability in the region. The non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test was used to determine temperature trends. The
   non-parametric estimator Sen's slope was used to quantify the variation
   of trends. The results showed the presence of statistically significant
   trends. A worrying and unexpected increase in temperatures was found
   during the winter period. This scenario was presented in three clusters,
   highlighting a mutation in the winter season, attributable to the
   climatic changes in progress rather than to territorial factors. If the
   trends maintain an increasing monotone character, in the coming decades
   there will be, in many areas of Sicily, a constant loss of fertile soil
   for the agricultural sector and the advancement of phenomena such as
   drought and desertification, to which the island is already predisposed.
   All of this will have serious socio-economic repercussions. Considering
   that a large part of the region's economy is based on the agricultural
   sector, these repercussions will be followed by serious environmental
   implications that will negatively affect the ecological sustainability
   of the region.},

Pages = {265-288},
Abstract = {A temporal trend analysis of weather variables is needed for developing
   mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate change. The objective of
   this work was to study temporal trends of 17 extreme temperature indices
   in North-Central Mexico (NCM). We used daily observations of maximum and
   minimum temperatures from 127 weather stations for 34 years (1980-2013).
   The extreme temperature indices were calculated with the RClimDex v1.9
   package. Analysis of trend indices was carried out with the Mann-Kendall
   technique and the rate of change with the Theil-Sen estimator. Except
   for the growing season length, all-temperature indices showed
   statistically signifi cant positive trends (SSPT) ( p = 0.05) between 1
   and 62; except for the cold spell duration indicator, all indices showed
   statistically significant negative trends (SSNT) between 3 and 62.The
   SSPT of all indices varied between 0.246 degrees C decade-1 (TMINMEAN)
   and 48.000 days decade-1 (SU25),while the SSNT varied between -55.238
   days decade-1 (SU25) and -0.181 degrees C decade-1 (TMINMEAN). In NCM,
   the increase in some indices could be causing an increase in crop water
   requirements and poorly meeting some crop's chilling requirements. In
   crops, such as grapevine, peach, and apple, an excellent short-term
   strategy to adapt to the decrease in cold winter and to compensate for
   the satisfaction of poor chilling hours using biostimulant of sprouting
   should be considered. New varieties/hybrids of corn and beans for
   dealing with the increase in warm days (TX90p), summer days (SU25), warm
   nights (TN90p), and tropical nights must be available; also, these new
   varieties should have shorter cycle and should be cold resistant.The
   results of this work constitute a reliable tool for generating answers
   for measures of adaptation to the onslaught of climate change in NCM.},

Abstract = {Based on the monthly mean temperatures recorded between 1961 and 2012 at
   14 meteorological stations on the southeast Tibetan Plateau (STP), the
   temporal and spatial variations in mean seasonal and annual temperature
   trends were investigated using the Mann-Kendall test. The temperature
   time series on the STP are mainly characterized by increasing trends,
   and the rate of warming on the STP is far higher than that in other
   areas in China and even in other parts of the world. Statistically
   significant increasing trends in mean seasonal and annual temperatures
   were observed during the study period at the = 0.01 level, and the
   increasing trend in winter was more significant than those in other
   seasons. The mean annual temperature increased by 0.0247 degrees C per
   year, and the mean winter temperature increased by 0.0353 degrees C per
   year. The mean temperature decreased obviously with increasing
   elevation, and the temperature variation due to the complex topography
   of the STP was more obvious than that associated with elevation. This
   result illustrates the important influence of complex topography on
   local climate change in the STP region. This study is beneficial for
   understanding the characteristics of local climate change on the STP in
   the context of global warming.},

Abstract = {Temperature variability in the Czech Republic is analysed by means of
   wavelet transforms. This advanced time-frequency analysis provides
   information about the nature and time-frequency localization of present
   oscillations. The data set comprises four mean monthly temperature
   series from Prague-Klei-nentinum, Brno, Mt Milesovka and the gridded
   temperature series for the Czech Republic. The results of their wavelet
   transforms are presented as (a) trend analysis (computed by the inverse
   wavelet transform) and (b) periodicities and oscillations
   (distinguishable from the series wavelet power spectra and global
   wavelet spectra). The results show considerable similarity among
   individual series. Examples are the parts of the wavelet power spectra
   in the time period between 1930 and 2001 expressed in all series
   studied, the pronounced oscillations of about 8 and 12-14 years in all
   series, and the noticeable increase of temperatures in all cases. As a
   supplement to this study, wavelet transforms were performed on the
   variance-adjusted version of combined land and marine temperature
   anomalies for the Northern Hemisphere from the Hadley Centre. Only some
   results of this analysis are mentioned and discussed. Copyright (C) 2004

Abstract = {The study of temperature change in major countries of the world since
   the 1980s is a key scientific issue given that such data give insights
   into the spatial differences of global temperature change and can assist
   in combating climate change. Based on the reanalysis of seven widely
   accepted datasets, which include trends in climate change and spatial
   interpolation of the land air temperature data, the changes in the
   temperature of major countries from 1981 to 2019 and the
   spatial-temporal characteristics of global temperature change have been
   assessed. The results revealed that the global land air temperature from
   the 1980s to 2019 varied at a rate of 0.320 degrees C/10a, and exhibited
   a significantly increasing trend, with a cumulative increase of 0.835
   degrees C. The mean annual land air temperature in the northern and
   southern hemispheres varied at rates of 0.362 degrees C/10a and 0.147
   degrees C/10a, respectively, displaying significantly increasing trends
   with cumulative increases of 0.828 degrees C and 0.874 degrees C,
   respectively. Across the globe, the rates of change of the mean annual
   temperature were higher at high latitudes than at middle and low
   latitudes, with the highest rates of change occurring in regions at
   latitudes of 80 degrees-90 degrees N, followed by regions from 70
   degrees-80 degrees N, then from 60 degrees-70 degrees N. The global land
   surface air temperature displayed an increasing trend, with more than
   80\% of the land surface showing a significant increase. Greenland,
   Ukraine, and Russia had the highest rates of increase in the mean annual
   temperature; in particular, Greenland experienced a rate of 0.654
   degrees C/10a. The regions with the lowest rates of increase of mean
   annual temperature were mainly in New Zealand and the equatorial regions
   of South America, Southeast Asia, and Southern Africa, where the rates
   were <0.15 degrees C/10a. Overall, 136 countries (93\%), out of the 146
   countries surveyed, exhibited a significant warming, while 10 countries
   (6.849\%) exhibited no significant change in temperature, of which 3
   exhibited a downward trend. Since the 1980s, there have been 4, 34 and
   68 countries with levels of global warming above 2.0 degrees C, 1.5
   degrees C and 1.0 degrees C, respectively, accounting statistically for
   2.740\%, 23.288\% and 46.575\% of the countries examined. This paper
   takes the view that there was no global warming hiatus over the period
   1998-2019.},

Abstract = {Understanding temporal and spatial characteristics of regional climate
   is essential for decision making in water resource management.
   Established statistical and GIS techniques were used to evaluate annual
   and seasonal variations of rainfall and temperature in time and space
   from 1979 to 2013 in the Limpopo River Basin (LRB). Annual means of
   rainfall in the LRB varied between 160 and 1109 mm, generally from west
   to east of the basin during the study period. Annual minimum and maximum
   temperature ranged from 8 degrees C in the south to 20 degrees C in the
   east of the basin, and 23 degrees C in the south of the basin to 32
   degrees C in the east. The respective coefficients of variation (CVs) of
   these variables showed an inverse pattern to the annual values, with
   rainfall having high CV values (28\% to 70\% from east to west of the
   basin) compared to temperature CV values. Seasonal variations followed
   similar patterns as annual variations for the individual variables
   examined. Trend analysis showed upward trends for both annual and
   seasonal rainfall in most parts of the basin, except for the winter
   season which showed a decreasing trend. Analysis of minimum temperature
   on an annual basis and for the winter season and spring season shows
   upward trends during the study period over the whole basin while minimum
   temperature for summer and autumn showed decreasing trends. Maximum
   temperature, by contrast, showed decreasing trends on an annual, summer,
   autumn, and spring basis but an increasing trend for winter during the
   study period in most parts of the basin.},

Abstract = {Understanding rainfall and temperature spatio-temporal variations at the
   local, regional, and global scales is vital for water resource
   utilization planning and making irrigation decisions. The present
   investigation attempts to identify trends and variations in the
   rainfall, temperature and relative humidity over 31 years (1990-2020) in
   the National Capital Region (NCR), Delhi, India, obtained from IARI
   meteorological station, Pusa, New Delhi. The statistical trend analyses
   were carryout using Mann-Kendall (MK) test followed by Theil Sen slope
   test for annual, monthly and seasonal analysis to assess the trend
   direction and magnitude of the change over time. Pettitt's test employed
   to detect the inflection point in the variable's time series. The annual
   Tmax, Tmin and rainfall showed an absence of trends in the data. While,
   annual relative humidity showed a positive increasing trend. Tmax
   indicated a statistically significant decreasing trend in the winter
   months of January and December. This implies a dip in the temperature in
   the winter months of January and December. Also, Tmax seasonal analysis
   revealed a decreasing trend during winter season. Similarly, Tmin
   revealed a decreasing trend for the winter months of January and
   December. Although, a statistically increasing trend for Tmin was seen
   in April, which may cause a harsh environment for cultivating the Zaid
   season crops due to increased warming. In addition, Tmin seasonal
   analysis revealed a decreasing trend during monsoon, autumn and winter
   seasons. Relative humidity showed positive increasing trends on annual,
   monthly, and seasonal basis except during February, June, July, August,
   September and Monsoon season. The trend change analysis showed no change
   point in the annual Tmax and Tmin data series. It was observed that Tmin
   in August showed a change point in the data trend in 2005. Also, the
   change point was detected in monsoon and winter seasons for Tmin data
   series. The change point in the annual average rainfall data was marked
   in 2012. Relative humidity also showed change points in data series in
   April, November, Annual and Monsoon season scales. A didactic
   implication of these changes on hydrologic design and crop irrigation
   decisions was discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {In an earlier study, a weaker trend in globalmean temperature over the
   past 15 years relative to the preceding decades was characterized as
   significantly lower than those contained within the phase 5 of the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) ensemble. In this study,
   divergence between model simulations and observations is estimated using
   a fixed-intercept linear trend with a slope estimator that has one-third
   the noise variance compared to simple linear regression. Following the
   approach of the earlier study, where intermodel spread is used to assess
   the distribution of trends, but using the fixed-intercept trend metric
   demonstrates that recently observed trends in global mean temperature
   are consistent (p > 0.1) with the CMIP5 ensemble for all 15-yr intervals
   of observation-model divergence since 1970. Significant clustering of
   global trends according to modeling center indicates that the spread in
   CMIP5 trends is better characterized using ensemble members drawn across
   models as opposed to using ensemble members from a single model. Despite
   model-observation consistency at the global level, substantial regional
   discrepancies in surface temperature trends remain.},

Title = {Data-driven modeling of surface temperature anomaly and solar activity
   trends},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {217-232},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A novel two-step modeling scheme is used to reconstruct and analyze
   surface temperature and solar activity data at global, hemispheric, and
   regional scales. First, the self-organizing map (SOM) technique is used
   to extend annual modern climate data from the century to millennial
   scale. The SOM component planes are used to identify and quantify
   strength of nonlinear relations among modern surface temperature
   anomalies (<150 years), tropical and extratropical teleconnections, and
   Palmer Drought Severity Indices (0-2000 years). Cross-validation of
   global sea and land surface temperature anomalies verifies that the SOM
   is an unbiased estimator with less uncertainty than the magnitude of
   anomalies. Second, the quantile modeling of SOM reconstructions reveal
   trends and periods in surface temperature anomaly and solar activity
   whose timing agrees with published studies. Temporal features in surface
   temperature anomalies, such as the Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age,
   and Modern Warming Period, appear at all spatial scales but whose
   magnitudes increase when moving from ocean to land, from global to
   regional scales, and from southern to northern regions. Some caveats
   that apply when interpreting these data are the high-frequency filtering
   of climate signals based on quantile model selection and increased
   uncertainty when paleoclimatic data are limited. Even so, all models
   find the rate and magnitude of Modern Warming Period anomalies to be
   greater than those during the Medieval Warm Period. Lastly, quantile
   trends among reconstructed equatorial Pacific temperature profiles
   support the recent assertion of two primary El Nino Southern Oscillation
   types. These results demonstrate the efficacy of this alternative
   modeling approach for reconstructing and interpreting scale-dependent
   climate variables. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {By comparing two sets of quality-controlled daily temperature
   observation data with and without the inhomogeneity test and adjustment
   from 654 stations in China during 1956-2004 and 1956-2010, impacts of
   inhomogeneity on changing trends of four percentile temperature extreme
   indices, including occurrences of cold days, cold nights, warm days, and
   warm nights with varying intensities, were discussed. It is found that
   the inhomogeneity affected the long-term trends averaged over extensive
   regions limitedly. In order to minimize the inhomogeneity impact, the 83
   stations identified with obvious inhomogeneity impacts were removed, and
   an updated analysis of changing trends of the four temperature extreme
   indices with varying intensities during 1956-2010 was conducted. The
   results show that annual occurrences of both cold nights and cold days
   decreased greatly while those of warm nights and warm days increased
   significantly during the recent 20 years. The more extreme the event is,
   the greater the magnitude of changing trends for the temperature extreme
   index is. An obvious increasing trend was observed in annual occurrences
   of cold days and cold nights in the recent four years. The magnitude of
   changing trends of warm extreme indices was greater than that of cold
   extreme indices, and it was greater in northern China than in southern
   China. Trends for summer occurrence of cold days were not significant.
   Decreasing trends of occurrences of both cold nights and cold days were
   the greatest in December, January, and February (DJF) but the least in
   June, July, and August (JJA), while increasing trends of warm nights
   were the greatest in JJA. Cold nights significantly decreased from 1956
   to 1990, and then the decreasing trend considerably weakened. The
   decreasing trend also showed an obvious slowdown in recent years for

Abstract = {Low-temperature water-gas shift reactivity trends on transition metals
   were investigated with the use of a microkinetic model based on a redox
   mechanism. It is established that the adsorption energies for carbon
   monoxide and oxygen can describe to a large extent changes in the
   remaining activation and adsorption energies through linear
   correlations. In comparisons with experimental data it is found that the
   model predicts well the order of catalytic activities for transition
   metals, although it fails to quantitatively describe the experimental
   data. This discrepancy could be due to the assumption that the redox
   mechanism dominates and to the neglect of adsorbate interactions, which
   play an important role at high coverages. The model predicts that the
   activity of copper can be improved by increasing the strengths with
   which carbon monoxide and oxygen are bonded to the surface, thus
   suggesting possible directions for improving the catalyst for
   low-temperature WGSR. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {{[}1] The United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN)
   temperature database shows a significant upward trend over the past half

   (dissimilarity or disorder) associated with the temperature trends of
   1,221 stations in the fully adjusted USHCN. We find that over the
   network, the spatial entropy levels are significantly and positively
   related to the observed temperature trends suggesting that stations most
   unlike their neighbors in terms of temperature change tend to have a
   higher temperature trend than their neighbors. These results suggest
   that the USHCN contains some questionable warming signals at some
   stations, despite the many attempts to quantitatively control for these

Abstract = {The radiative forcing of the surface-troposphere system caused by
   stratospheric ozone depletion in the 1980s is calculated using observed
   values of change in ozone, from TOMS data, and temperature, from MSU
   data. The seasonal variation of the ozone and temperature trends
   produces strong seasonal and latitudinal variations in radiative
   forcing. The balance between peak positive solar forcing and maximum
   negative longwave forcing shifts the peak negative forcing at the South
   Pole from November to October. The time difference between peak ozone
   loss and maximum temperature decrease results in net positive values in
   Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes in August and September. Positive
   values also occur at low latitudes in both hemispheres. The globally and
   annually averaged net radiative forcing is about -0.025W m(-2) between
   1979 and 1990, much less than that previously reported using fixed
   dynamical heating model temperature changes, although inclusion of the
   ozone 14 mu m band would somewhat narrow this gap. Ozone radiative
   forcing is very sensitive to the vertical profile of temperature change.},

Title = {Temperature trends and its elevation-dependent warming over the Qilian
   Mountains},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {500-510},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding temperature variability especially elevation dependent
   warming (EDW) in high-elevation mountain regions is critical for
   assessing the impacts of climate change on water resources including
   glacier melt, degradation of soils, and active layer thickness. EDW
   means that temperature is warming faster with the increase of altitude.
   In this study, we used observed temperature data during 1979-2017 from
   23 meteorological stations in the Qilian Mountains (QLM) to analyze
   temperature trend with Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope approach.
   Results showed that the warming trends for the annual temperature
   followed the order of T\_min > T\_mean > T\_max and with a shift both
   occurred in 1997. Spring and summer temperature have a higher increasing
   trend than that in autumn and winter. T\_mean shifts occurred in 1996
   for spring and summer, in 1997 for autumn and winter. T\_max shifts
   occurred in 1997 for spring and 1996 for summer. T\_min shifts occurred
   in 1997 for spring, summer and winter as well as in 1999 for autumn.
   Annual mean diurnal temperature range (DTR) shows a significant
   decreasing trend (-0.18 degrees C/10a) from 1979 to 2017. Summer mean
   DTR shows a significant decreasing trend (-0.26 degrees C/10a) from 1979
   to 2017 with a shift occurred in 2010. After removing longitude and
   latitude factors, we can learn that the warming enhancement rate of
   average annual temperature is 0.0673 degrees C/km/10a, indicating that
   the temperature warming trend is accelerating with the continuous
   increase of altitude. The increase rate of elevation temperature is
   0.0371 degrees C/km/10a in spring, 0.0457 degrees C/km/10a in summer,
   0.0707 degrees C/km/10a in autumn, and 0.0606 degrees C/km/10a in
   winter, which indicates that there is a clear EDW in the QLM. The main
   causes of warming in the Qilian Mountains are human activities,
   cloudiness, ice-snow feedback and El Nino phenomenon.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we probe the possibility of high-temperature conventional

   A database of 320 metastable structures with fixed composition
   (50\%/50\%) is generated with the minima hopping method, and
   characterized with electronic and vibrational descriptors. Full
   electron-phonon calculations on 16 representative structures allow us to
   identify general trends in T-c across and within the four families in
   the energy landscape, and to construct an approximate T-c predictor,
   based on transparently interpretable and easily computable electronic
   and vibrational descriptors. Based on these, we estimate that around
   10\% of all metallic structures should exhibit T-c's above 30 K. This
   paper is a first step toward ab initio design of new high-T-c

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper assessed the variability and projected trends of solar
   irradiance and temperature in the East of Burundi. Observed temperature
   from meteorological stations and the MERRA-2 data set provided by
   NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center are used over the historical period
   1976-2005. In addition, solar irradiance data provided by SoDa database
   were considered. Furthermore, projection data from eight Regional
   Climate Models were used over the periods 2026-2045 and 2066-2085. The
   variability analysis was performed using a standardized index. Projected
   trends and changes in the future climate were respectively detected
   through Mann-Kendall and t-tests. The findings over the historical
   period revealed increase temperature and decrease in solar irradiance
   over the last decades of the 20th century. At a monthly scale, the
   variability analysis showed that excesses in solar irradiance coincide
   with the dry season, which led to the conclusion that it may be a period
   of high production for solar energy. In the future climate, upward
   trends in temperature are expected over the two future periods, while no
   significant trends are forecasted in solar irradiance over the entire
   studied region. However, slight decreases and significant changes in
   solar irradiance have been detected over all regions.},

   ground surface temperature histories with a warming of 1.51 +/- 0.76K
   during the period of 1850 to 2000, similar to borehole reconstructions
   for the southern portion of the Superior Province and in agreement with
   available proxy data. A cooling period corresponding to the Little Ice
   Age was found at only one site. Despite permafrost maps locating the
   sites in a region of discontinuous permafrost, the ground surface
   temperature histories suggest that the potential for permafrost was
   minimal to absent over the past 500 years. This could be the result of
   air surface temperature interpolation used in permafrost models being
   unsuitable to account for the spatial variability of ground temperatures
   along with an offset between ground and air surface temperatures due to
   the snow cover.},

Title = {Diurnal Temperature Range Trends Differ Below and Above the Melting
   Point},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {The globally averaged diurnal temperature range (DTR) has shrunk since
   the mid-20th century, and climate models project further shrinking.
   Observations indicate a slowdown or reversal of this trend in recent
   decades. Here, we show that DTR has a minimum for average temperatures
   close to 0 degrees C. Observed DTR shrinks strongly at colder
   temperature, where warming shifts the average temperature toward the DTR
   minimum, and expands at warmer temperature, where warming shifts the
   average temperature away from the DTR minimum. Most, but not all climate
   models reproduce the minimum DTR close to average temperatures of 0
   degrees C and a stronger DTR shrinking at colder temperature. In models
   that reproduce the DTR minimum, DTR shrinking slows down significantly
   in recent decades. Models project that the global-mean DTR will shrink
   over the 21st century, and models with a DTR minimum close to 0 degrees
   C project slower shrinking than other models.
   The diurnal temperature range, that is, the difference between daily
   maximum and minimum temperatures, affects both human health and plant
   development. Global data sets have shown a shrinking diurnal temperature
   range since the 1950s, but a recent study found that the diurnal
   temperature range had expanded again. In this study, we investigate how
   the diurnal temperature range behaves at different mean temperatures. We
   find that the diurnal temperature range is particularly small for
   temperatures close to the melting point of water (0 degrees C), and
   larger for both colder and warmer temperatures. Due to the latent heat
   of freezing/melting, more energy is required to warm the soil from -1 to
   +1 degrees C than from -3 to -1 degrees C or from 1 to 3 degrees C. The
   diurnal temperature range shrinks in regions and seasons with negative
   average temperature, where global warming pushes the average closer to 0
   degrees C and expands for warmer temperature. Most, but not all climate
   models also show a narrow diurnal temperature range near 0 degrees C,
   shrinking of the temperature range at colder temperature and a slower
   reduction in the diurnal temperature range in recent decades. Models
   suggest that the currently observed expansion of the diurnal temperature
   range is a transient phenomenon.
   The diurnal temperature range (DTR) has a local minimum near average
   temperatures of 0 degrees C DTR in observations shrinks strongly for
   average temperatures below 0 degrees C and expands for warmer
   temperatures Climate models that reproduce the local DTR minimum near 0
   degrees C show a significant slowdown of DTR shrinking in recent decades},

Title = {Sensitivity of tropospheric and stratospheric temperature trends to
   radiosonde data quality},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1776-1796},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Radiosonde data have been used, and will likely continue to be used, for
   the detection of temporal trends in tropospheric and lower-stratospheric
   temperature. However, the data are primarily operational observations,
   and it is not clear that they are of sufficient quality for precise
   monitoring of climate change. This paper explores the sensitivity of
   upper-air temperature trend estimates to several data quality issues.
   Many radiosonde stations do not have even moderately complete records of
   monthly mean data for the period 1959-95. In a network of 180 stations
   (the combined Global Climate Observing System Baseline Upper-Air Network
   and the network developed by J. K. Angell), only 74 stations meet the
   data availability requirement of at least 85\% of nonmissing months of
   data for tropospheric levels (850-100 hPa). Extending into the lower
   stratosphere (up to 30 hPa), only 22, stations have data records meeting
   this requirement for the same period, and the 30-hPa monthly data are
   generally based on fewer daily observations than at 50 hPa and below.
   These networks show evidence of statistically significant tropospheric
   warming, particularly in the Tropics, and stratospheric cooling for the
   period 1959-95. However, the selection of different station networks can
   cause network-mean trend values to differ by up to 0.1 K decade(-1).
   The choice of radiosonde dataset used to estimate trends influences the
   results. Trends at individual stations and pressure levels differ in two
   independently produced monthly mean temperature datasets. The
   differences are generally less than 0.1 K decade(-1), but in a few cases
   they are larger and statistically significant at the 99\% confidence
   level. These cases are due to periods of record when one dataset has a
   distinct bias with respect to the other.
   The statistical method used to estimate linear trends has a small
   influence on the result. The nonparametric median of pairwise slopes
   method and the parametric least squares linear regression method tend to
   yield very similar, but not identical, results with differences
   generally less than +/-0.03 K decade(-1) for the period 1959-95.
   However, in a few instances the differences in stratospheric trends for
   the period 1970-95 exceed 0.1 K decade(-1).
   Instrument changes can lead to abrupt changes in the mean, or
   change-points, in radiosonde temperature data records, which influence
   trend estimates. Two approaches to removing change-points by adjusting
   radiosonde temperature data were attempted. One involves purely
   statistical examination of time series to objectively identify and
   remove multiple change-points. Methods of this type tend to yield
   similar results about the existence and timing of the largest
   change-points, but the magnitude of detected change-points is very
   sensitive to the particular scheme employed and its implementation. The
   overwhelming effect of adjusting time series using the purely
   statistical schemes is to remove the trends, probably because some of
   the detected change-points are not spurious signals but represent real
   atmospheric change.
   The second approach incorporates station history information to test
   specific dates of instrument changes as potential change-points, and to
   adjust time series only if there is agreement in the test results for
   multiple stations. This approach involved significantly fewer
   adjustments to the time series, and their effect was to reduce
   tropospheric warming trends (or enhance tropospheric cooling) during
   1959-95 and (in the case of one type of instrument change) enhance
   stratospheric cooling during 1970-95. The trends based on the adjusted
   data were often statistically significantly different from the original
   trends at the 99\% confidence level. The intent here was not to correct
   or improve the existing time series, but to determine the sensitivity of
   trend estimates to the adjustments. Adjustment for change-points can
   yield very different time series depending on the scheme used and the
   manner in which it is implemented, and trend estimates are extremely
   sensitive to the adjustments. Overall, trends are more sensitive to the
   treatment of potential change-points than to any of the other radiosonde
   data quality issues explored.},

Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {208},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Variations in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are an important driver of
   marine species abundance in Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). Studies
   concerned with climate change induced SST trends within these LMEs have
   so far been relying on satellite data and reanalysis products, with the
   disadvantages of only having short time -periods available and having to
   rely on the ability of the models to correctly simulate SST-dynamics,
   respectively. Here, we provide for the first time a long-term trend
   analysis of SST for 17 LMEs of the Atlantic Ocean over two different
   time-periods (1957-2020 and 1980-2020) based on in-situ data gathered
   from three data collections. We sort our results according to warming
   categories that were established in an earlier study, i.e.,
   ``cooling{''} (below 0 degrees C/dec), ``slow{''} (0-0.07 degrees
   C/dec), ``moderate{''} (0.07-0.14 degrees C/dec), ``fast{''} (0.14-0.21
   degrees C/dec) and ``su-perfast{''} (above 0.21 degrees C/dec). Our
   results show a persistent ``slow{''} to ``superfast{''} warming in all
   considered LMEs. However, the sparse data coverage induces large
   uncertainties, so that many LMEs cannot uniquely be assigned to one
   warming category only. We detect no systematic changes in the seasonal
   SST amplitude of the considered LMEs. We find that the LMEs of the North
   Atlantic warm faster than those of the South Atlantic and that this
   difference is increasing with time. Out of the North Atlantic LMEs, the
   Norwegian Sea, North Sea, Celtic-Biscay Shelf, Gulf of Mexico and the
   Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf belong exclusively to the superfast
   warming category for the period 1980-2020.},

Journal = {EARTH INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {1-21},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lakes have been suggested as an indicator of climate change; however,
   long-term, systematic records of lake temperature are limited. Satellite
   remote sensing is capable of supporting lake temperature mapping with
   the advantage of large-area and systematic observations. The goal of
   this research application was to assess spatiotemporal trends in lake
   skin temperature for all lakes over 8 ha across northern New England for
   the past three decades. Nearly 10 000 Landsat scenes for July, August,
   and September from 1984 to 2014 were processed using MODTRAN and MERRA
   parameterizations to generate atmospherically corrected lake skin
   temperature records. Results show, on average, lakes warmed at a rate of
   0.8 degrees C decade(-1), with smaller lakes warming at a faster rate.
   Complementing regression and space-time analyses showed similar results
   (R-2 = 0.63) for lake temperature trends and found lakes, on average,
   are warming faster than daily maximum or minimum air temperature. No
   major hot spots were found as lake temperature changes were
   heterogeneous on a local scale and evenly distributed across the region.
   Maximum and minimum daily temperature, lake size, and elevation were
   found as significant drivers of lake temperature. This effort provides
   the first regionally focused and comprehensive spatiotemporal assessment
   of thousands (n = 3955) of lakes concentrated in one geographic region.
   The approach is scalable and adaptable to any region for assessing lake
   temperature trends and potential drivers.},

Title = {Temperature trends in Hawai?i: A century of change, 1917-2016},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3987-4001},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Based on a revised and extended multi-station Hawai?i Temperature Index
   (HTI), the mean air temperature in the Hawaiian Islands has warmed
   significantly at 0.052 degrees C/decade (p<0.01) over the past 100years
   (1917-2016). The year 2016 was the warmest year on record at 0.924
   degrees C above the 100-year mean (0.202 degrees C). During each of the
   last four decades, mean state-wide positive air temperature anomalies
   were greater than those of any of the previous decades. Significant
   warming trends for the last 100years are evident at low- (0.056 degrees
   C/decade, p <0.001) and high-elevations (0.047 degrees C/decade,
   p<0.01). Warming in Hawaii is largely attributed to significant
   increases in minimum temperature (0.072 degrees C/decade, p<0.001)
   resulting in a corresponding downward trend in diurnal temperature range
   (-0.055 degrees C/decade, p<0.001) over the 100-year period. Significant
   positive correlations were found between HTI, the Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation, and the Multivariate ENSO Index, indicating that natural
   climate variability has a significant impact on temperature in Hawai?i.
   Analysis of surface air temperatures from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data for
   the region of Hawai?i over the last 69years (1948-2016) and a mean
   atmospheric layer temperature time series calculated from
   radiosonde-measured thickness (distance between constant pressure
   surfaces) data over the last 40years (1977-2016) give results consistent
   with the HTI. Finally, we compare temperature trends for Hawaii's
   highest elevation station, Mauna Loa Observatory (3,397m), to those on
   another mountainous subtropical island station in the Atlantic, Mt.
   Izana Observatory (2,373m), Tenerife, Canary Islands. Both stations sit
   above the local temperature inversion layer and have virtually identical
   significant warming trends of 0.19 degrees C/decade (p<0.001) between
   1955 and 2016.},

Abstract = {This study considers time series of temperature versus pressure, T(p),
   from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) across the stratopause
   region, where the effects of radiative forcings from the greenhouse
   gases (CO2 and H2O) and from ozone are most pronounced. Trend analyses
   of HALOE T(p) values for 1993-2005 are for six levels from 2.0 to 0.3
   hPa with a vertical resolution of about 4 km and for eight latitude
   zones from 65 degrees S to 65 degrees N. The analyses account for the
   forcing effects from the 11-yr solar cycle. HALOE trends at 2.0 hPa are
   of the order of -1.0 K/decade across the tropics and subtropics but then
   become smaller (-0.5 K/decade) at the middle latitudes. Near-global T(p)
   trends are of order -0.5 K/decade but have a minimum of -0.2 K/decade at
   1.0 hPa; they are clearly negative in the southern but slightly positive
   in the northern hemisphere. The combined radiative forcings from CO2,
   H2O, and ozone vary between -0.4 and -0.7 K/decade for 1993-2005 and are
   hemispherically symmetric. The HALOE temperature trend and total
   radiative cooling profiles differ from those reported from observations
   and calculations for 1980-2000, mainly because the ozone trends changed
   from clearly negative in the 1980s through mid-1990s to slightly
   positive during the time of HALOE. Trends at low latitudes for the
   tracer, methane (CH4), increase from 2\% to 4\%/decade from 50 to 10 hPa
   and then to similar to 6\%/decade by 5 hPa. Analyses of time series of
   CH4 across the stratopause reveal subseasonal scale variability within
   the northern hemisphere that reduces the significance of the T(p)
   trends.},

Title = {Trends in temperature over Godavari River basin in Southern Peninsular

Abstract = {There is little dispute that global surface air temperature has
   increased and the anthropogenic-induced global warming is likely to play
   an important role in the management of water resources of a river basin.
   Therefore, this study was undertaken for Godavari River basin, a large
   southern peninsular river basin in India. After removing the effect of
   significant lag-1 serial correlation by pre-whitening procedure, the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test was employed to investigate trends in maximum
   temperature (T-max), minimum temperature (T-min) and mean temperature
   (T-mean) at 35 stations in the basin. At seasonal (monthly) time scales,
   a majority of the stations exhibited no trends in T-mean, T-max and
   T-min in any of the four seasons (12 months) with the exception of
   post-monsoon (December) for T-max and monsoon (July and September) for
   T-min. About 60\% (45\%) of the stations exhibited increasing trends in
   T-max (T-min) in different durations: the month of December and
   post-monsoon season (the months of July and September and monsoon
   season) indicating the presence of an element of seasonal cycle in
   temperature over the Godavari basin. Results of tests of spatial and
   temporal homogeneity of trends by the Van Belle and Hughes method showed
   that trends in temperature over the Godavari basin were not homogeneous
   for different months or at different stations. In spite of the warmer
   climate in the basin, the evaporation (Epan) has been found to decrease
   significantly over the Godavari basin. Strong decreases in wind speed
   and increases in relative humidity may have actually caused the Epan
   decreases over the southern peninsular region of India.},

   average air temperature are observed throughout the atmospheric boundary
   layer in Siberia; the trend value decreases from north to south and with
   altitude. The main contribution to the regional climate warming in the

Abstract = {Background: The discovery of the dynamics of seasonal and non-seasonal
   influenza outbreaks remains a great challenge. Previous internet-based
   surveillance studies built purely on internet or climate data do have
   potential error.
   Methods: We collected influenza notifications, temperature and Google
   Trends (GT) data between January 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2016. We
   performed time-series cross correlation analysis and temporal risk
   analysis to discover the characteristics of influenza epidemics in the
   period. Then, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average
   (SARIMA) model and regression tree model were developed to track
   influenza epidemics using GT and climate data.
   Results: Influenza infection was significantly corrected with GT at lag
   of 1-7 weeks in Brisbane and Gold Coast, and temperature at lag of 1-10
   weeks for the two study settings. SARIMA models with GT and temperature
   data had better predictive performance. We identified autoregression
   (AR) for influenza was the most important determinant for influenza
   occurrence in both Brisbane and Gold Coast.
   Conclusions: Our results suggested internet search metrics in
   conjunction with temperature can be used to predict influenza outbreaks,
   which can be considered as a pre-requisite for constructing early
   warning systems using search and temperature data.},

Abstract = {Based monthly mean temperature data of 76 stations and monthly extreme
   temperature data of 16 typical stations in Hubei Province from 1979 to
   2000 and methods of linear regression analysis, multinomial fitting,
   Mann-Kendall test, moving-t testing, the authors analyzed the annual,
   seasonal, and monthly mean temperature temporal and spatial variation
   characteristics. The results showed that the air temperature in Hubei
   Province had a rising tendency during 21 years, the warming abrupt
   change of annual mean temperature occurred in 1994. Seasonal mean
   temperature rose most especially in autumn and winter. The annual
   extreme high temperature and annual extreme low temperature had a
   warming trend. The air temperature increased weakly in the southwest of
   Hubei Province and increased evidently in the other regions. The annual
   extreme high temperature trend rate was on the rise from southeast to
   northwest, and the annual extreme low temperature increased weakly in
   the southwest of Hubei Province and increased greatly in the other
   regions.},

Abstract = {Tropospheric temperature trends based on Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU)
   channel 2 data are susceptible to contamination from strong
   stratospheric cooling. Recently, Fu et al. devised a method of removing
   the stratospheric contamination by linearly combining data from MSU
   channels 2 and 4. In this study the sensitivity of the weights of the
   two channels in the retrieval algorithm for the tropospheric
   temperatures to the choice of period of record used in the analysis and
   to the choice of training dataset is examined. The weights derived using
   monthly temperature anomalies are within about 10\% of those obtained by
   Fu et al. irrespective of the choice of analysis period or training
   dataset. The trend errors in the retrieved global-mean tropospheric
   temperatures tested using two independent radiosonde datasets are less
   than about 0.01 K decade(-1) for all time periods of 25 yr or longer
   with different starting and ending years during 1958 - 2004. It is found
   that the retrievals are more robust if they are interpreted in terms of
   the layer-mean temperature for the entire troposphere, rather than the
   mean of the 850-300-hPa layer. Because large spurious jumps remain in
   the reanalyses, especially prior to 1979, one should be cautious when
   using them as training datasets and in testing the trend errors.},

Abstract = {Global temperature records over the past century are compared to

   the 1940s and the 1980s south-eastern Europe, China, and the northern
   Atlantic have experienced a summertime cooling. The first two of these
   regions agree well with those where anthropogenic sulfur emissions have
   increased during the same period. During winter, the two former regions
   experienced a substantial warming while the northern Atlantic and
   south-eastern US exhibited a cooling. The results are qualitatively
   consistent with theoretical calculations which indicate that
   anthropogenic sulfate aerosols cause a substantial cooling. However,
   because of large natural variations in the temperature records, the
   statistical significance of this conclusion is low.},

Journal = {VETERINARY RECORD},

Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {BackgroundHypothermia during the perianaesthetic period may lead to an
   increased risk of morbidity in veterinary patients. However, the
   timeline of the decrease in body temperature during general anaesthesia
   has been minimally investigated. MethodsAnaesthetic records of 1097
   client-owned dogs were examined. Change in body temperature (Delta BT =
   baseline temperature - time point temperature) was plotted over time for
   all dogs. The slope of Delta BT was calculated for each 15-minute
   interval, and the magnitude of the largest Delta BT and the time point
   at which the largest Delta BT occurred were determined for each record.
   ResultsA rapid decline in Delta BT occurred from 0 to 15 minutes, a
   slower decline occurred from 15 to 60 minutes and a plateau occurred
   from 60 to 240 minutes. The largest Delta BT occurred at 75 (15-240)
   minutes from baseline, with a maximum Delta BT of -2.06 degrees C (-0.06
   degrees C to -8.72 degrees C). LimitationsThis is a retrospective study.
   As such, there were missing data points and potential confounding
   factors could not be controlled for. ConclusionsAnaesthetised dogs
   exhibited a distinct pattern of decrease in body temperature, with the
   most rapid reduction occurring within the first 15 minutes. The effects
   of procedures and anaesthetic agents on the timeline and pattern of heat
   loss warrant further investigation.},

   analysed: Herceg Novi, Ulcinj, Budva and Bar. Two periods (before 1980
   and after 1980) were separately investigated in this study due to a
   well-known climate shift that occurred in the late 1970s. Seven indices
   of temperature extremes have been chosen. The trend was analysed using a
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test, while the slope was estimated using
   Sen's slope estimator. A negative trend has been calculated for cold
   nights and cold days at almost all stations. The most significant
   positive trends were obtained for warm conditions. The two separately
   investigated periods have shown contrasting temperature trends.},

Title = {Propagation of linear surface air temperature trends into the
   terrestrial subsurface},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Previous studies have tested the long-term coupling between air and
   terrestrial subsurface temperatures working under the assumption that
   linear trends in surface air temperature should be equal to those
   measured at depth within the subsurface. A one-dimensional model of heat
   conduction is used to show that surface trends are attenuated as a
   function of depth within conductive media on time scales of decades to
   centuries, therefore invalidating the above assumption given practical
   observational constraints. The model is forced with synthetic linear
   temperature trends as the time-varying upper boundary condition;
   synthetic trends are either noise free or include additions of Gaussian
   noise at the annual time scale. It is shown that over a 1000 year
   period, propagating surface trends are progressively damped with depth
   in both noise-free and noise-added scenarios. Over shorter intervals,
   the relationship between surface and subsurface trends is more variable
   and is strongly impacted by annual variability (i.e., noise). Using
   output from the FOR1 millennial simulation of the GKSS ECHO-G General
   Circulation Model as a more realistic surface forcing function for the
   conductive model, it is again demonstrated that surface trends are
   damped as a function of depth within the subsurface. Observational air
   and subsurface temperature data collected over 100 years in Armagh,
   Ireland, and 29 years in Fargo, North Dakota, are also analyzed and
   shown to have subsurface temperature trends that are not equal to the
   surface trend. While these conductive effects are correctly accounted
   for in inversions of borehole temperature profiles in paleoclimatic
   studies, they have not been considered in studies seeking to evaluate
   the long-term coupling between air and subsurface temperatures by
   comparing trends in their measured time series. The presented results
   suggest that these effects must be considered and that a demonstrated
   trend equivalency in air and subsurface temperatures is inconclusive
   regarding their long-term tracking.},

Title = {Identifying rogue air temperature stations using cluster analysis of

Abstract = {A new and efficient method for identifying ``rogue{''} air temperature
   stations-locations with unusually large air temperature trends-is
   presented. Instrumentation problems and spatially unrepresentative local
   climates are sometimes more apparent in air temperature extremes, Vet
   can have more subtle impacts on variations in mean air temperature. As a
   result. using data from over 1300 stations in North America, the tails
   of daily air temperature frequency distributions were examined for
   unusual trends. In particular, linear trends in the 5th percentile of
   daily minimum air temperature during the winter months and the 95th
   percentile of daily maximum air temperature during the summer were
   analyzed. Cluster analysis then was used to identify stations that were
   distinct from other locations. Both single- and average linkage
   clustering were evaluated.
   By identifying individual stations along the entire periphery of the
   percentile trend space, single-linkage clustering appears to produce
   better results than that of average linkage. Average linkage clustering
   tends to group together several stations with large trends: however only
   a handful of these stations appear distinctly different from the large
   body of trends toward the center of the percentile trend space. Maps of
   the rogue stations show that most are in close proximity to numerous
   other stations that were not grouped into the rogue cluster, making it
   unlikely that the unusually large temperature trends were due to
   regional climatic variations. As with all approaches for evaluating data
   quality, time series plots and station history information also must be
   inspected to more fully understand inhomogeneous variations in
   historical climatic data.},

Abstract = {The assessment of temperature variability in any region of the world is
   important for prior planning in the context of current climate change.
   The mean monthly, seasonal and annual temperature data of nine
   meteorological stations was analysed in this study to determine the
   temperature variability and trend in Baluchistan province, Pakistan. The
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator were applied to
   investigate the temperature trend pattern in the study Temperature data
   from the relevant meteorological stations (met-stations) were collected
   for this purpose from the Pakistan Meteorological Department and the
   National Center for Environmental Information. The result revealed an
   increasing significant trend (IST) in the mean annual temperature at
   Dalbandin, Kalat, Quetta, Zhob and Gawadar meteorological stations.
   While the seasonal minimum, maximum and mean temperature showed trend
   fluctuations in winter, spring and autumn seasons. In the seasonal
   analysis, the increasing trend has been detected in most of the
   meteorological stations (Dalbandin, Kalat, Quetta, Zhob, Khuzdar,
   Lasbella, Gawadar) in all four seasons. Whereas in Sibi met-station, a
   decreasing significant trend (DST) was recorded in summer (minimum,
   maximum and mean) and the met-station Barkhan recorded decreasing trend
   in maximum temperature in the autumn season. The Baluchistan province is
   totally spread over an arid and semiarid area of Pakistan where
   temperature fluctuations further aggravate the deprived agriculture and
   sparse natural vegetation.},

Title = {Detection of type of trends in surface air temperature in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {596},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Detection of the type of trend in temperature data, by distinguishing
   between deterministic and stochastic trends, has important implications
   for understanding climate change. The Unit root tests (URTs) have been
   widely used for detecting the type of trend, but they do not consider
   the possibility of fractional integration and its influences. In this
   study, we detected the type of trends in observed surface air
   temperature during 1960-2019 at 558 stations across China, by
   considering fractional integration. The whole period was divided into
   three sub-periods by two structural breakpoints (denoted as SBP1 and
   SBP2). The fractional differencing parameter d was estimated by the
   Local Whittle (LW) function, and then three URTs (namely PP, KPSS, and
   ZA) were used to detect the type of trends in the temperature data
   during different sub-periods. The results indicated that the de-seasoned
   monthly temperature (DMT) series were fractionally integrated and, thus,
   exhibited long-range dependence characteristics, which significantly
   influenced the estimation of the slope of trend and detection of the
   type of trend. Compared with the LW function, the ordinary least squares
   method yielded biased estimation of the slope of trend, as it could not
   eliminate the influence of long-range dependence of the DMT series. The
   DMT series with weak long-range dependence or anti-persistent
   characteristics during 1960-SBP1, SBP1-SBP2, and SBP2-2019 were
   accurately detected as deterministic trends. However, the DMT series
   with strong long-range dependence during SBP1-2019 and 1960-2019 were
   detected to have stochastic trends by the KPSS test. Following the
   results of the fractional integration and URTs together, temperature
   over short periods in China were detected to have deterministic trends,
   but those at long periods were detected to have a combination of
   long-range dependence and deterministic trends.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {This study analyses spatial and temporal trends in extreme temperature
   indices over Nigeria. The percentile indices were calculated from newly
   homogenized daily minimum and maximum temperature data for the period
   1971-2012 for 21 stations in Nigeria. Indices describing the
   characteristics of hot extremes and cold extremes are calculated with
   the RClimDex software. The annual and seasonal trends in these indices
   are obtained using the ordinary least square fit and the statistical
   significance tested using the R-based modified Mann-Kendall test. We
   examine characteristics of these indices for the entire country and
   separately for the three geographical zones in Nigeria: Guinea, Savanna,
   and Sahel. The spatial and temporal patterns of trends in the indices
   indicate that Nigeria has experienced statistically significant increase
   in the frequency of hot extreme and decrease in cold extreme events.
   Although majority of the stations have significant trends in warm days
   and warm nights, the annual trend is greatest in warm nights. In
   addition, the rate of warming in minimum temperature (warm nights') is
   stronger in June, July, August (JJA) and September, October, November
   (SON) compare with December, January, February (DJF) and March, April,
   May (MAM). As for the trends in cold days and cold nights, the trends in
   cold nights are larger than for cold days at both the annual and
   seasonal scales. The regional analysis indicates that trends in warm
   nights and cold nights are most pronounced in Guinea and Sahel regions.},

Abstract = {A series of oligomers, containing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) moieties,
   with the same composition of amphiphilic functionalities has been
   designed, synthesized, and characterized on the basis of their
   temperature-sensitive behavior. The non-covalent amphiphilic aggregates,
   formed from these molecules, influence their temperature sensitivity.
   Covalent tethering of the amphiphilic units also has a significant
   influence on their temperature sensitivity. The lower critical solution
   temperatures of these oligomers show increasingly sharp transitions with
   increasing numbers of OEG functional groups, indicating enhanced
   cooperativity in dehydration of the OEG moieties when they are
   covalently tethered. These molecules were also engineered to be
   concurrently sensitive to enzymatic reaction and pH. This possibility
   was investigated using porcine liver esterase as the enzyme; we show
   that enzymatic action on the pentamer lowers its temperature
   sensitivity. The product moiety from the enzymatic reaction also gives
   the amphiphilic oligomer a pH-dependent temperature sensitivity.},

Abstract = {Subsurface temperature trends in the better-sampled parts of the World
   Ocean are reported. Where there are sufficient observations for this
   analysis, there is large spatial variability of 51-yr trends in the
   upper ocean, with some regions showing cooling in excess of 3 degrees C,
   and others warming of similar magnitude. Some 95\% of the ocean area
   analyzed has both cooled and warmed over 20-yr subsets of this period.
   There is much space and time variability of 20-yr running trend
   estimates, indicating that trends over a decade or two may not be
   representative of longer-term trends. Results are based on sorting
   individual observations in World Ocean Database 2001 into 1 degrees x 1
   degrees and 2 degrees x 2 degrees bins. Only bins with at least five
   observations per decade for four of the five decades since 1950 are
   used. Much of the World Ocean cannot be examined from this perspective.
   The 51-yr trends significant at the 90\% level are given particular
   attention. Results are presented for depths of 100, 300, and 500 m. The
   patterns of the 90\% significant trends are spatially coherent on scales
   resolved by the bin size. The vertical structure of the trends is
   coherent in some regions, but changes sign between the analysis depths
   in a number of others. It is suggested that additional attention should
   be given to uncertainty estimates for basin average and World Ocean
   average thermal trends.},

Title = {Prediction Challenges From Errors in Tropical Pacific Sea Surface
   Temperature Trends},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Models in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) predict sea
   surface temperature (SST) trends in the central and eastern equatorial
   Pacific Ocean which are more positive than those observed over the
   period 1982-2020. These trend errors are accompanied by linear trends in
   the squared error of SST forecasts whose sign is determined by the mean
   model bias (cold equatorial bias is linked to negative trends in squared
   error and vice versa). The reason for this behavior is that the overly
   positive trend reduces the bias of models that are too cold and
   increases the bias of models that are too warm. The excessive positive
   SST trends in the models are also linked with overly positive trends in
   tropical precipitation anomalies. Larger (smaller) SST trend errors are
   associated with lower (higher) skill in predicting precipitation
   anomalies over the central Pacific Ocean. Errors in the linear SST trend
   do not explain a large percentage of variability in precipitation
   anomaly errors, but do account for large errors in amplitude. The
   predictions toward a too warm and wet tropical Pacific, especially since
   2000, are strongly correlated with an increase in El Nino false alarms.
   These results may be relevant for interpreting the behavior of
   uninitialized CMIP5/6 models, which project SST trends that resemble the
   NMME trend errors.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the variability and trends of the mean annual
   and seasonal surface air temperature in southern Greece, namely in Crete
   and in the islands of the southern Aegean Sea. The climatic data used
   are the mean monthly homogenized air temperature values of seven
   meteorological stations of the Hellenic Meteorological Service, for the
   period 1960-2004. A Bayesian trend analysis is performed by fitting
   alternative stochastic-trend models based on the Log-normal, the Normal,
   the Generalized Extreme Value and the Gumbel distributions. Posterior
   simulations results based on the best fitting model reveal the locations
   and time-periods with the strongest and the weakest interannual trends
   for both mean and variance. Furthermore, a model comparison experiment
   based on Bayes Factors compares the above stochastic-trend models with
   the corresponding ones with no-time trends. The results are very
   significant since they reveal the locations and the seasons where
   interannual trends for both mean and variance have real grounds.},

Title = {Weather whiplash: Trends in rapid temperature changes in a warming

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Pages = {4214-4222},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Both research and media attention has shown an increasing interest in
   rapidly changing weather, colloquially termed ``weather whiplash{''}
   events. This research examines the spatial and seasonal variability of
   trends in seasonally standardized short-term temperature ranges across
   the globe. Trends are calculated for three different ``range
   windows{''}: 7-day ranges, 1-day departure, and diurnal (24-hr)
   temperature ranges. Results show that globally, over the 70-year period
   of record 7- and 1-day ranges are increasing substantially in all
   seasons, while diurnal trends are only changing (decreasing)
   significantly in boreal autumn. Since 1985, however, ranges at all three
   time windows have increased significantly. The most widespread changes
   are occurring as significant increases in these ranges in the Southern
   Ocean, Africa, and South America and in regions of coastal upwelling.
   Significant decreases in these ranges are noted mostly at the Arctic
   Ocean confluence with the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, especially in the
   Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian Seas, and more recently, in
   northeastern Canada. Oceanic trends appear driven by changes in wind
   speeds, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where increasing
   open-ocean winds are nearly ubiquitous. Trends in temperature
   variability over land are largely inverse of the long-term changes in
   cloud cover. This research adds to a growing body of climate change
   literature examining temperature variability trends, and it represents
   the first examination of full 70-year trends of many variables contained
   in the recently released ERA5 reanalysis.},

Title = {Recent trends in daily temperature extremes over northeastern Spain
   (1960-2006)},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2583-2603},
Abstract = {Spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme temperature events in
   northeastern Spain have been investigated. The analysis is based on
   long-term, high-quality, and homogenous daily maximum and minimum
   temperature of 128 observatories spanning the period from 1960 to 2006.
   A total of 21 indices were used to assess changes in both the cold and
   hot tails of the daily temperature distributions. The presence of trends
   in temperature extremes was assessed by means of the Mann-Kendall test.
   However, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and a bootstrap methodology
   were used to account for the influence of serial correlation and
   cross-correlation on the trend assessment. In general, the observed
   changes are more prevalent in hot extremes than in cold extremes. This
   finding can largely be linked to the increase found in the mean maximum
   temperature during the last few decades. The results indicate a
   significant increase in the frequency and intensity of most of the hot
   temperature extremes. An increase in warm nights (TN90p: 3.3 days
   decade(-1)), warm days (TX90p: 2.7 days decade(-1)), tropical nights
   (TR20: 0.6 days decade(-1)) and the annual high maximum temperature
   (TXx: 0.27 degrees C decade(-1)) was detected in the 47-yr period. In
   contrast, most of the indices related to cold temperature extremes (e.
   g. cold days (TX10p), cold nights (TN10p), very cold days (TN1p), and
   frost days (FD0)) demonstrated a decreasing but statistically
   insignificant trend. Although there is no evidence of a long-term trend
   in cold extremes, significant interdecadal variations were noted. Almost
   no significant trends in temperature variability indices (e. g. diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) and growing season length (GSL)) are detected.
   Spatially, the coastal areas along the Mediterranean Sea and the
   Cantabrian Sea experienced stronger warming compared with mainland
   areas. Given that only few earlier studies analyzed observed changes in
   temperature extremes at fine spatial resolution across the Iberian
   Peninsula, the results of this work can improve our understanding of
   climatology of temperature extremes. Also, these findings can have
   different hydrological, ecological and agricultural implications (e. g.
   crop yields, energy consumption, land use planning and water resources
   management).},

   upper-air sites located between 65 degrees N and 83 degrees N, spatial
   fields of the trend values in the 50-100hPa layer are considered. The
   temporal variability of the trend is analysed by comparing the trend
   values obtained for different (partly overlapping) 20-year periods of
   observation. Considerable spatial and temporal variability of the trend
   is confirmed testifying that dynamics should be an important contributor
   to it. The 40-year fields of the trend reveal that the negative trend
   values which dominate in the polar region seem to be greater over North
   Atlantic and northern Siberia than over the Canadian Arctic. (c) 2005

Abstract = {In the evolution of pervasive electronics, it is imperative to
   significantly reduce the energy consumption of power systems and embrace
   sustainable materials and fabrication processes with minimal carbon
   footprint. Within this context, thermoelectric generators (TEGs) have
   garnered substantial attention in recent years because of the readily
   available thermal gradients in the environment, making them a promising
   energy-harvesting technology. Current commercial room-temperature
   thermoelectrics are based on scarce, expensive, and/or toxic V-VI
   chalcogenide materials, which limit their widespread use. Thermoelectric
   polymers partially address this issue, and as such, they have been
   intensively studied in the field in the past decade. However, less
   popular materials have recently appeared to respond to the challenges of
   room-temperature thermoelectrics in terms of sustainability and cost. In
   this contribution, we comprehensively review the latest advancements in
   emerging alternative materials with the potential to pave the way for
   the next generation of sustainable TEGs. This upcoming generation
   includes flexible and printed TEGs for applications like wearables or
   the Internet of Things.},

Title = {Assessment of Spatial Distribution and Temporal Trends of Temperature in

Abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important elements of climate, which
   undergoes temporal and spatial changes under the influence of local and
   external factors. These changes can cover micro and macroclimate areas
   as well as short to long-term periods. Therefore, in the present study,
   the spatial patterns of temperature change in Iran over the past
   half-century are discussed. To this end, average annual temperature of
   383 synoptic stations in Iran during 50 years (1961-2010) were collected
   from Iran Meteorological Organization. Linear regression and local
   Moran's I were used to analyze the trend of changes and the spatial
   patterns respectively. The results of intra-decade changes in
   temperature showed that the average temperature of Iran has increased
   significantly in recent decades, and have experienced less significant
   daily fluctuations at the same time. Results obtained from analysis of
   intra-decade temperature change trend showed that temperature has
   dramatically increased as a result of rises in mean temperature levels
   in recent decades, such that in the fourth (1991 to 2000) and fifth
   decade (2001 to 2010) the temperature variation trend has increased by
   0.17 and 0.1 respectively, while the temperature of Iran in the first
   and third decade has declined by -0.03. The results obtained from
   analysis of spatial pattern of intra-decade temperature variation showed
   that spatial temperature pattern in Iran is mostly influenced by local
   factors such as latitudes variations. Generally, with increasing
   latitude in Iran, the temperature decreases. The temperature in the
   mountainous areas (negative spatial autocorrelation), southern parts,
   and areas around Persian Gulf, follow a high spatial pattern (positive
   spatial autocorrelation) due to lower latitudes and special condition of
   greenhouse gas emission. However, in recent decades, the positive
   spatial pattern zones have increased significantly as a result of upward
   temperature trends.},

Title = {Simulations of Eurasian winter temperature trends in coupled and

Journal = {ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {14-26},

Abstract = {Conflicting results have been presented regarding the link between
   Arctic sea-ice loss and midlatitude cooling, particularly over Eurasia.
   This study analyzes uncoupled (atmosphere-only) and coupled
   (ocean-atmosphere) simulations by the Climate Forecast System, version 2
   (CFSv2), to examine this linkage during the Northern Hemisphere winter,
   focusing on the simulation of the observed surface cooling trend over
   Eurasia during the last three decades. The uncoupled simulations are
   Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) runs forced with mean
   seasonal cycles of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice, using
   combinations of SST and sea ice from different time periods to assess
   the role that each plays individually, and to assess the role of
   atmospheric internal variability. Coupled runs are used to further
   investigate the role of internal variability via the analysis of
   initialized predictions and the evolution of the forecast with lead
   time.
   The AMIP simulations show a mean warming response over Eurasia due to
   SST changes, but little response to changes in sea ice. Individual runs
   simulate cooler periods over Eurasia, and this is shown to be concurrent
   with a stronger Siberian high and warming over Greenland. No substantial
   differences in the variability of Eurasian surface temperatures are
   found between the different model configurations. In the coupled runs,
   the region of significant warming over Eurasia is small at short leads,
   but increases at longer leads. It is concluded that, although the models
   have some capability in highlighting the temperature variability over
   Eurasia, the observed cooling may still be a consequence of internal
   variability.},

Abstract = {For the applications in automotive, aircraft, aerospace, and electronic
   industries, the lightest structural Mg alloys have received much
   attention since 2000. There has been some progress for the improvement
   of the mechanical properties such as room temperature strength,
   formability and mechanical anisotropy. However, the high temperature
   strength of Mg alloys is very low to be used for the parts and
   structures of high temperature conditions. For the last decade,
   considerable efforts are concentrated for the development of Mg alloys
   to be used at high temperature. Newly developing Mg-RE alloys are the
   good examples for the high temperature use. In this regard, this review
   paper introduces the recent research trends for the development of Mg-RE
   alloys strengthened with some precipitates and the long period stacking
   ordered (LPSO) structures related RE elements.},

Abstract = {A new high-quality daily and monthly temperature station dataset was
   prepared for the tropical Western Pacific through a quality control and
   homogenization process. The homogeneity of 46 temperature stations,
   collected at a workshop conducted as part of the Pacific-Australia
   Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning program, was assessed and
   the non-climatic step changes were removed. Here we present trends in
   mean and extreme temperature for the Western Pacific, covering an
   extended time period and larger geographical area compared with previous
   analyses. We discuss five main conclusions: (1) There is a significant
   warming trend in annual mean temperature over the past 50 years
   (1961-2011), of between 0.05 and 0.34 degrees C per decade. (2)
   Significant and spatially homogeneous warming trends are evident at the
   station level over 1961-2011 for the warm and cool extremes of both
   maximum and minimum temperatures. (3) Sub-regional trends, over the
   period 1951-2011, are spatially coherent, with the largest warming
   trends in the hottest day and night of the year and the coolest night of
   the year. (4) This analysis highlights the role of decadal variability
   in the number of days exceeding extreme temperature thresholds, with the
   upper (lower) tails of the distribution warming more (less) in recent
   decades. (5) We show that strong relationships exist between local and
   remote sea-surface temperature anomalies and all indices of extreme
   temperature, particularly with minimum temperature extremes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {859-866},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Radiosonde data show a large seasonal difference in trends since 1979 in
   the tropical lower stratosphere, with a maximum cooling of similar to 1
   K decade(-1) in December and January and a minimum in March or April at
   50 mb between 10 degrees N and 10 degrees S. The statistically
   significant difference of up to similar to 1 K decade(-1) between trends
   in December and those in March amounts to up to 20\% of the
   climatological seasonal cycle. Although the size of annual mean cooling
   trends differs substantially among datasets, the seasonal pattern of
   trends is similar in all six radiosonde datasets used here and is
   consistent with MSU satellite data for the lower stratosphere. This
   greater cooling in boreal winter essentially disappears below 100 mb,
   and the troposphere has a different and smaller seasonal trend pattern.
   Trends in the tropical stratosphere show an inverse relationship with
   those in the Arctic for 1979-2009, which might be related to changes in
   stratospheric circulation. In most radiosonde data, however, the
   seasonal pattern of tropical trends at 50 mb since 1979 seems to come
   from a seasonal difference in the size of the stratospheric cooling in
   the mid-1990s, and trends for longer time periods or those for 1995-2009
   do not show the same seasonal dependence. Whether the strengthening of
   the seasonal cycle in the stratosphere represents a long-term change
   related to greenhouse gas forcing, a shorter-lived shift related to
   ozone depletion or unforced interdecadal variability requires careful
   further study.},

   findings for the entire Northern Hemisphere. European winter average
   temperatures during the period 1500 to 1900 were reduced by similar
   to0.5degreesC (0.25degreesC for annual mean temperatures) compared to
   the 20th century. Summer temperatures did not experience systematic
   century-scale cooling relative to present conditions. The coldest
   European winter was 1708/1709; 2003 was by far the hottest summer.},

Abstract = {We have performed a multi-methodological theoretical study of impact of
   thermal vibrations on the Mossbauer effect in the tetragonal beta-phase
   of tin. We have seamlessly combined (i) atomic-scale numerical data in
   the form of mean square displacements of Sn atoms determined by
   quantum-mechanical calculations, (ii) continuumlevel thermodynamic
   modeling based on the quasi-harmonic approximation and (iii) theoretical
   analysis of Mossbauer effect resulting in the prediction of temperature
   dependence of Mossbauer factor. The computed results were compared with
   our Mossbauer and X-ray experimental data. We show that classical
   theoretical approaches based on simplistic Debye model of thermal
   vibrations of solids can be nowadays replaced by exact ab initio
   calculations of individual thermal vibrations. While both Debye and our
   approach slightly deviate from the experimental data, our suggested
   methodology bears promises for future improvement and a better agreement
   with measurements, i.e. the prospect that the over-simplified Debye
   model may not offer.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of Morocco's climate
   extreme trends during the last four decades. Indices were computed based
   on a daily temperature and precipitation using a consistent approach
   recommended by the ETCCDI. Trends in these indices were calculated at 20
   stations from 1970 to 2012. Twelve indices were considered to detect
   trends in temperature. A large number of stations have significant
   trends and confirm an increase in temperature, showing increased warming
   during spring and summer seasons. The results also show a decrease in
   the number of cold days and nights and an increase in the number of warm
   days and nights. Increasing trends have also been found in the absolute
   warmest and coldest temperatures of the year. A clear increase is
   detected for warm nights and diurnal temperature range. Eight indices
   for precipitation were also analyzed, but the trends for these
   precipitation indices are much less significant than for temperature
   indices and show more mixed spatial patterns of change. Heavy
   precipitation events do not exhibit significant trends except at a few
   locations, in the north and central parts of Morocco, with a general
   tendency towards drier conditions. The correlation between these climate
   indices and the large-scale atmospheric circulations indices such as the
   NAO, MO, and WEMO were also analyzed. Results show a stronger
   relationship with these climatic indices for the precipitation indices
   compared to the temperature indices. The correlations are more
   significant in the Atlantic regions, but they remain moderate at the
   whole country scale.},

Title = {Temperature condensation trend in the debris-disk binary system
   ζ<SUP>2</SUP> Reticuli},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {588},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Context. Detailed abundance studies have reported different trends
   between samples of stars with and without planets, possibly related to
   the planet formation process. Whether these differences are still
   present between samples of stars with and without debris disk is still
   unclear.
   Aims. We explore condensation temperature T-c trends in the unique
   binary system zeta(1) Ret - zeta(2) Ret to determine whether there is a
   depletion of refractories that could be related to the planet formation
   process. The star zeta(2) Ret hosts a debris disk which was detected by
   an IR excess and confirmed by direct imaging and numerical simulations,
   while zeta(1) Ret does not present IR excess or planets. These
   characteristics convert zeta(2) Ret in a remarkable system where their
   binary nature together with the strong similarity of both components
   allow us, for the first time, to achieve the highest possible abundance
   precision in this system.
   Methods. We carried out a high-precision abundance determination in both
   components of the binary system via a line-by-line, strictly
   differential approach. First we used the Sun as a reference and then we
   used zeta(2) Ret. The stellar parameters T-eff, log g, {[}Fe/H], and
   upsilon(turb) were determined by imposing differential ionization and
   excitation equilibrium of Fe I and Fe II lines, with an updated version
   of the program FUNDPAR, together with plane-parallel local thermodynamic
   equilibrium ATLAS9 model atmospheres and the MOOG code. We then derived
   detailed abundances of 24 different species with equivalent widths and
   spectral synthesis with the MOOG program. The chemical patterns were
   compared with a recently calculated solar-twins T-c trend, and then
   mutually between both stars of the binary system. The rocky mass of
   depleted refractory material was estimated according to recent data.
   Results. The star zeta(1) Ret is found to be slightly more metal rich
   than zeta(2) Ret by similar to 0.02 dex. In the differential calculation
   of zeta(1) Ret using zeta(2) Ret as reference, the abundances of the
   refractory elements are higher than the volatile elements, and the trend
   of the refractory elements with Tc shows a positive slope. These results
   together show a lack of refractory elements in zeta(2) Ret ( a
   debris-disk host) relative to zeta(1) Ret. The Tc trend would be in
   agreement with the proposed signature of planet formation rather than
   possible galactic chemical evolution or age effects, which are largely
   diminished here. Then, following the recent interpretation, we propose a
   scenario in which the refractory elements depleted in zeta(2) Ret are
   possibly locked up in the rocky material that orbits this star and
   produce the debris disk observed around this object. We estimated a
   lower limit of M-rock similar to 3 M-circle plus for the rocky mass of
   depleted material, which is compatible with rough estimations of 3-50
   M-circle plus of a debris disk mass around a solar-type star.},

   one must examine results using a common subset of locations to minimize
   spatial sampling effects. When this is done for the
   Lanzante-Klein-Seidel (LKS) and Hadley Center (HadRT) radiosonde data
   sets, differences are reduced by at least one third. Differing
   homogeneity adjustment methods and differences in the source data are
   both important factors contributing to the remaining discrepancies. In
   contrast, subsampling the microwave sounding unit (MSU) satellite data
   sets according to the radiosonde coverage does not generally bring the
   trends in the satellite data closer to those in the radiosonde data so
   that adjustments and other processing differences appear to be the
   predominant sources of satellite-radiosonde discrepancies. Experiments
   in which we subsample globally complete data sets provide additional
   insight into the role of sampling errors. In the troposphere, spatial
   sampling errors are frequently comparable to the trends for 1979 1997,
   while in the stratosphere the errors are generally small relative to the
   trends. Sampling effects estimated from National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction reanalysis and MSU satellite data for seven
   actual radiosonde networks show little consistent relation between
   sampling error and network size. These results may have significant
   implications for the design of future climate monitoring networks.
   However, estimates of sampling effects using the reanalysis and the
   satellite data sets differ noticeably from each other and from effects
   estimated from actual radiosonde data, suggesting that these globally
   complete data sets may not fully reproduce actual sampling effects.},

Abstract = {For an accurate assessment of the relative roles of natural variability
   and anthropogenic influence in the Earth's climate, reconstructions of
   past temperatures from the pre-industrial as well as the industrial
   period are essential. But instrumental records are typically available
   for no more than the past 150 years. Therefore reconstructions of
   pre-industrial climate rely principally on traditional climate proxy
   records(1-5), each with particular strengths and limitations in
   representing climatic variability. Subsurface temperatures comprise an
   independent archive of past surface temperature changes that is
   complementary to both the instrumental record and the climate proxies.
   Here we use present-day temperatures in 616 boreholes from all
   continents except Antarctica to reconstruct century-long trends in
   temperatures over the past 500 years at global, hemispheric and
   continental scales. The results confirm the unusual warming of the
   twentieth century revealed by the instrumental record(6), but suggest
   that the cumulative change over the past five centuries amounts to about
   1 K, exceeding recent estimates from conventional climate proxies(2-5).
   The strength of temperature reconstructions from boreholes lies in the
   detection of long-term trends, complementary to conventional climate
   proxies, but to obtain a complete picture of past warming, the
   differences between the approaches need to be investigated in detail.},

Abstract = {An important impact of climate change on agriculture and the
   sustainability of ecosystems is the increase of extended warm spells
   during winter. We apply crossing theory to the central England
   temperature time series of winter daily maximum temperatures to quantify
   how increased occurrence of higher temperatures translates into more
   frequent, longer-lasting, and more intense winter warm spells. We find
   since the late 1800s an overall two- to threefold increase in the
   frequency and duration of winter warm spells. A winter warm spell of 5
   days in duration with daytime maxima above 13 degrees C has a return
   period that was often over 5 years but now is consistently below 4
   years. Weeklong warm intervals that return on average every 5 years now
   consistently exceed similar to 13 degrees C. The observed changes in the
   temporal pattern of environmental variability will affect the phenology
   of ecological processes and the structure and functioning of ecosystems.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {32},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Tree rings have been used to both reconstruct past climate, and to
   estimate and project carbon uptake of forest ecosystems. Here we show
   that large groups of trees of the dominant tree species within
   widely-distributed circumpolar forest sites show opposing growth trends
   during recent warming. These opposing growth trends are present at a
   sub-chronology level and, if averaged into chronologies, may have
   contributed to the widely reported overall decreased temperature
   sensitivity of high-latitude chronologies over recent decades. Unlike
   previous studies, we find that temperature sensitivity has actually
   increased for most individual trees at these sites. This recent,
   widespread divergence in growth response seems unique over the past
   three centuries, and may relate to different microsite responses of
   individual trees to temperature-induced drought stress or other factors.
   This divergence needs to be taken into account in dendroclimatic
   reconstructions, estimations of global warming impacts, and carbon
   uptake projections.},

Title = {A study of unexpected autoignition temperature trends for pure
   <i>n</i>-alkanes},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {306},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {An experimental study of minimum autoignition temperatures (AIT) reveals
   unexpected behavior of pure, higher-carbon-number n-alkanes (C16 and
   larger) not predicted by current AIT prediction methods nor current
   phenomenological understanding of autoignition processes. The
   well-documented AIT trend for normal alkanes shows high AIT values for
   smaller members of the family with decreasing AIT, as carbon chain
   length increases, to a roughly constant value for C7 and larger.
   Measurements in this work show that values start to increase again at
   C16 and show a dramatic and previously unexplained step increase between
   C25 and C26. The impact of measurement methods on AIT values is
   discussed. Experimental modifications to compensate for AIT measurements
   at altitude are presented. Measured values for several n-alkanes using
   the ASTM E-659 method are reported and compared to data from other
   sources. Temperature-versus-time plots, external auto ignition
   experiments, lag times, and decomposition measurements using
   differential scanning calorimetry are also reported and examined for
   several n-alkanes to illucidate the unexpected trends. A mechanistic
   explanation of these trends is proposed. Finally, the implications of
   this behavior for trends in other chemical families are discussed.},

Title = {Orbital Forcing Strongly Influences Seasonal Temperature Trends During
   the Last Millennium},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Insolation changes caused by the axial precession induce millennial
   trends in last millennium temperature, varying with season and latitude.
   A characteristic seasonal trend pattern can be detected in both
   insolation and modeled surface temperature response. In the
   extratropical Northern Hemisphere, the maximum insolation trend occurs
   around April/May, while the minimum trend occurs between July and
   September. The temperature trend lags behind insolation trend by around
   a month. Hence orbital forcing potentially affects long-term trends in
   proxy data, which are often sensitive to a distinct seasonal window. We
   find that tree-ring reconstructions based on early growing season
   dominated records show different millennial trends from those for late
   summer dominated proxies. The differential response is similar to that
   seen in pseudo proxy reconstructions when considering proxy seasonality.
   This suggests that orbital forcing has influenced long-term trends in
   climate proxies. It is therefore vital to use seasonally homogeneous
   data for reconstructing multicentennial variability.},

   stations exhibited warming trends. For each station, the temperature
   relative to the average value during 1961-1990 was found. The resulting
   temperature change averaged over the Arctic stations was plotted. For
   the period 1820-2014, trends were found for the January, July and annual
   temperatures of 1.0, 0.0 and 0.7 A degrees C per century, respectively.
   Decadal variations are evident and much of the temperature increase
   occurred during the 1990s. Over the past century, Siberia, Alaska and
   Western Canada have experienced somewhat greater warming than Eastern
   Canada, Greenland and Northern Europe. The temperature change
   experienced by the Arctic stations during the last two centuries closely
   tracks that found for the European stations.},

Title = {Long-term trends and interannual variability of temperature in Drake
   Passage},

Abstract = {Temperature data collected over the last 36 years (1969-2004) in Drake
   Passage are used to examine interannual temperature variation and
   long-term trends in the upper ocean. To reduce the effect of variation
   from different sampling locations and temporal variability introduced by
   meridional shifts in the Polar Front (PF), the data were divided into
   two sub-regions north (similar to 3800 temperature profiles) and south
   (similar to 3400) of the PF. Temperature anomalies were formed by
   removing a temporal mean field for each profile in each sub-region at
   100 m depth intervals from the surface to 700 m. North of the PF,
   statistically significant warming trends of similar to 0.02 degrees C
   yr(-1) were observed that were largely depth-independent between 100 and
   700 m. A statistically significant cooling trend of -0.07 degrees C
   yr(-1) was observed at the surface south of the PF, which was smaller
   (0.04 degrees C yr(-1)) but still statistically significant when
   possible seasonal sampling biases were accounted for. The observed
   cooling at the surface and warming at depth is largely consistent with a
   poleward shift of the PF due to enhancement of westerly winds in the
   Southern Ocean, as recently suggested by models and observations. The
   observed annual temperature anomalies in the upper 400 m north of the PF
   and in the upper 100 m south of the PF are highly correlated to
   variability in sea ice, and also to climate indices of the Antarctic
   Oscillation and the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Variability in sea ice
   and temperature anomalies lag El Nino variability in the Pacific, with a
   phasing consistent with the observed cyclical patterns of sea ice and
   sea surface temperature associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave
   or Antarctic Dipole Mode in the Southern Ocean. In contrast, the sea ice
   variability and temperature anomalies at all depths north of the PF and
   at 0-100 m depth south of the PF were primarily coincident with, or led
   the Antarctic Oscillation Index. No significant correlations were found
   with the large-scale climate variability indices in southern Drake
   Passage below 100 m depth, which is occupied by upper Circumpolar Deep
   Water (uCDW). This water mass is not formed locally, is largely isolated
   from the surface, and exhibits vertical and lateral homogeneity. Hence
   changes may be difficult to detect in the available measurements, and
   climate variation in the source water regions of uCDW may take a long
   time to reach Drake Passage. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Urbanization effects on observed surface air temperature trends in north

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2008},

Number = {6},
Pages = {1333-1348},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {A dataset of 282 meteorological stations including all of the ordinary
   and national basic/reference surface stations of north China is used to
   analyze the urbanization effect on surface air temperature trends. These
   stations are classified into rural, small city, medium city, large city,
   and metropolis based on the updated information of total population and
   specific station locations. The significance of urban warming effects on
   regional average temperature trends is estimated using monthly mean
   temperature series of the station group datasets, which undergo
   inhomogeneity adjustment. The authors found that the largest effect of
   urbanization on annual mean surface air temperature trends occurs for
   the large-city station group, with the urban warming being 0.16 degrees
   C (10 yr)(-1), and the effect is the smallest for the small-city station
   group with urban warming being only 0.07 degrees C (10 yr)(-1). A
   similar assessment is made for the dataset of national basic/reference
   stations, which has been widely used in regional climate change analyses
   in China. The results indicate that the regional average annual mean
   temperature series, as calculated using the data from the national
   basic/reference stations, is significantly impacted by urban warming,
   and the trend of urban warming is estimated to be 0.11 degrees C (10
   yr)(-1). The contribution of urban warming to total annual mean surface
   air temperature change as estimated with the national basic/reference
   station dataset reaches 37.9\%. It is therefore obvious that, in the
   current regional average surface air temperature series in north China,
   or probably in the country as a whole, there still remain large effects
   from urban warming. The urban warming bias for the regional average
   temperature anomaly series is corrected. After that, the increasing rate
   of the regional annual mean temperature is brought down from 0.29
   degrees C (10 yr)(-1) to 0.18 degrees C (10 yr)(-1), and the total
   change in temperature approaches 0.72 degrees C for the period analyzed.},

Abstract = {Simultaneous occurrences of multiple heatwaves or cold spells in remote
   geographical regions have drawn considerable attention in the literature
   due to their potentially far-reaching impacts. We introduce a flexible
   toolbox to study such concurrent temperature extremes with adjustable
   parameters that different users can tailor to their specific needs. We
   then use the toolbox to present a climatological analysis of spatially
   compounding heatwaves and cold spells in the global midlatitudes.
   Specific geographical areas, such as western Russia, central Europe,
   southwestern Eurasia and western North America, emerge as hotspots for
   concurrent temperature extremes. Concurrent heatwaves are becoming more
   frequent, longer-lasting and more extended in the Northern Hemisphere,
   while the opposite holds for concurrent cold spells. Concurrent
   heatwaves in the Southern Hemisphere are comparatively rare but have
   been increasing in both number and extent. Notably, several of these
   trends in concurrent temperature extremes are significantly stronger
   than the corresponding trends in all temperature extremes.},

Title = {Critically Reassessing Tropospheric Temperature Trends from Radiosondes
   Using Realistic Validation Experiments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Biases and uncertainties in large-scale radiosonde temperature trends in
   the troposphere are critically reassessed. Realistic validation
   experiments are performed on an automatic radiosonde homogenization
   system by applying it to climate model data with four distinct sets of
   simulated breakpoint profiles. Knowledge of the ``truth'' permits a
   critical assessment of the ability of the system to recover the
   large-scale trends and a reinterpretation of the results when applied to
   the real observations.
   The homogenization system consistently reduces the bias in the daytime
   tropical, global, and Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical trends but
   underestimates the full magnitude of the bias. Southern Hemisphere (SH)
   extratropical and all nighttime trends were less well adjusted owing to
   the sparsity of stations. The ability to recover the trends is dependent
   on the underlying error structure, and the true trend does not
   necessarily lie within the range of estimates. The implications are that
   tropical tropospheric trends in the unadjusted daytime radiosonde
   observations, and in many current upper-air datasets, are biased cold,
   but the degree of this bias cannot be robustly quantified. Therefore,
   remaining biases in the radiosonde temperature record may account for
   the apparent tropical lapse rate discrepancy between radiosonde data and
   climate models. Furthermore, the authors find that the unadjusted global
   and NH extratropical tropospheric trends are biased cold in the daytime
   radiosonde observations.
   Finally, observing system experiments show that, if the Global Climate
   Observing System (GCOS) Upper Air Network (GUAN) were to make climate
   quality observations adhering to the GCOS monitoring principles, then
   one would be able to constrain the uncertainties in trends at a more
   comprehensive set of stations. This reaffirms the importance of running
   GUAN under the GCOS monitoring principles.},

Abstract = {Near-real-time satellite precipitation estimation is indispensable in
   areas where ground-based measurements are not available. In this study,
   an evaluation of two near-real-time products from the Center for
   Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing at the University of California,
   Irvine-PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed
   Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification
   System) and PDIR-Now (PERSIANN-Dynamic Infrared Rain Rate
   near-real-time)-were compared to each other and evaluated against IMERG
   Final (Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation
   Measurement-Final Run) from 2015 to 2020 over the Mekong River Basin and
   Delta (MRB) using a spatial resolution of 0.1 circle by 0.1 circle and
   at a daily scale. PERSIANN-CDR (PERSIANN-Climate Data Record) was also
   included in the evaluation but was not compared against the real-time
   products. In this evaluation, PDIR-Now exhibited a superior performance
   to that of PERSIANN-CCS, and the performance of PERSIANN-CDR was deemed
   satisfactory. The second part of the study entailed performing a
   Mann-Kendall trend test of extreme precipitation indices using 38 years
   of PERSIANN-CDR data over the MRB. This annual trend analysis showed
   that extreme precipitation over the 95th and 99th percentiles has
   decreased over the Upper Mekong River Basin, and the consecutive number
   of wet days has increased over the Lower Mekong River Basin.},

Title = {Trends in Flowering Phenology of Herbaceous Plants and Its Response to

Abstract = {Based on limited controlled experiments, both advanced and delayed
   shifts in flowering phenology induced by precipitation and snow cover
   have been reported on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). To clarify the
   impact of precipitation and snow cover on flowering phenology, we
   conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis of the temporal change in
   flowering phenology and its responses to precipitation and snow cover
   changes using regression models built on the largest collection of
   ground phenological observation data on the QTP. We found that first
   flowering date (FFD) for the early-flowering time series significantly
   advanced at the rate of -0.371 +/- 0.149 days/year (p < 0.001), whereas
   FFD mid-to-late-flowering time series showed no trend at the rate of
   0.158 +/- 0.193 days/year (p = 0.108). Cumulative pre-season
   precipitation regressed with FFD positively for early-flowering time
   series, with the explained variation ranging from 11.7 to 49.4\% over
   different pre-season periods. The negative impact of precipitation on
   flowering phenology is unexpected, because an increase in precipitation
   should not hamper plant growth in the semi-arid and arid environments on
   the QTP. However, precipitation was found to be inversely correlated
   with temperature. Thus, it is likely that temperature, and not
   precipitation, regulated flowering phenology over the study period. No
   relationship was found between FFD and snow-cover melt date or duration.
   This result indicated that snow cover may not affect flowering phenology
   significantly, which may be because plant flowering time was much later
   than the snow-cover melt date on the QTP. These findings contrast the
   results of controlled experiments on the QTP, which showed that
   precipitation regulated flowering phenology, and with other studies that
   showed that snow-cover melting time determined flowering dates of
   early-flowering species in high latitude and Arctic zones in Europe and
   North America, where the low-temperature environment is similar to the
   QTP. These findings can improve flowering phenology models, assist in
   the prediction of phenological responses of herbaceous plants to climate
   change, and forecast changes in the structure and function of the
   grassland ecosystem on the QTP.},

Abstract = {The monthly rainfall data from 1901 to 2011 and maximum and minimum
   temperature data from 1901 to 2005 are used along with the reference
   evapotranspiration (ET0) to analyze the climate trend of 45 stations of
   Madhya Pradesh. ET0 is calculated by the Hargreaves method from 1901 to
   2005 and the computed data is then used for trend analysis. The temporal
   variation and the spatial distribution of trend are studied for seasonal
   and annual series with the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's estimator of
   slope. The percentage of change is used to find the rate of change in
   111 years (rainfall) and 105 years (temperatures and ET0).
   Interrelationships among these variables are analyzed to see the
   dependency of one variable on the other. The results indicate a
   decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures and ET0 trend. A similar
   pattern is noticeable in all seasons except for monsoon season in
   temperature and ET0 trend analysis. The highest increase of temperature
   is noticed during post-monsoon and winter. Rainfall shows a notable
   decrease in the monsoon season. The entire state of Madhya Pradesh is
   considered as a single unit, and the calculation of overall net change
   in the amount of the rainfall, temperatures (maximum and minimum) and
   ET0 is done to estimate the total loss or gain in monthly, seasonal and
   annual series. The results show net loss or deficit in the amount of
   rainfall and the net gain or excess in the temperature and ET0 amount.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The effects of temperature and rainfall changes on hydropower generation
   in Ghana from 1960-2011 were examined to understand country-wide trends
   of climate variability. Moreover, the discharge and the water level
   trends for the Akosombo reservoir from 1965-2014 were examined using the
   Mann-Kendall test statistic to assess localised changes. The annual
   temperature trend was positive while rainfall showed both negative and
   positive trends in different parts of the country. However, these trends
   were not statistically significant in the study regions in 1960 to 2011.
   Rainfall was not evenly distributed throughout the years, with the
   highest rainfall recorded between 1960 and 1970 and the lowest rainfalls
   between 2000 and 2011. The Mann-Kendall test shows an upward trend for
   the discharge of the Akosombo reservoir and a downward trend for the
   water level. However, the discharge irregularities of the reservoir do
   not necessarily affect the energy generated from the Akosombo plant, but
   rather the regular low flow of water into the reservoir affected power
   generation. This is the major concern for the operations of the Akosombo
   hydropower plant for energy generation in Ghana.},

Abstract = {Climate change is an environmental challenge for rural communities that
   rely heavily on rainwater-based agriculture. The main goal of this study
   is to investigate spatiotemporal variability and trends in rainfall and
   temperature in southern Ethiopia. Extreme temperature and rainfall
   indices were computed using the ClimPACT2 software. The detection and
   quantification of trends in rainfall and temperature extremes were
   analyzed using a nonparametric modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test and
   Sen's slope estimator. Results indicated that the mean annual rainfall
   has a declining trend at Boditi School and Mayokote stations with a
   statistically significant amount at magnitudes of 0.02 mm and 0.04 mm,
   respectively. The highest average monthly rainfall in the catchment was
   observed in the months of April, May, June, July, and August up to
   maximum rainfall of 117.50 mm, 177.43 mm, and 228.84 mm in Bilate Tena,
   Boditi, and Mayakote stations, respectively. On a seasonal scale,
   rainfall in Bilate Tena station was highly variable in all months,
   ranging from 49.54\% to 126.92\%, and three seasons except spring which
   showed moderate variation at 40.65\%. In addition, the three locations
   over the catchment exhibited varied drought signs such as severe (1.28 <
   SRA < 1.65) and extreme drought (SRA > 1.65). The temperature indices,
   on the other hand, exhibited a warming trend over the catchment which
   was observed through an increased annual number of warm days (TX90p) and
   warm nights (TN90p) ranges from 0.274 to 6.03 and 0.274 to 3.16,
   respectively. The annual maximum value of the daily maximum temperature
   (TXx) ranges from 30.10 to 33.76degree celsius in the three
   agroecological zones and showed low, medium, and high values in Dega,
   Woyna Dega, and Kola agroecologies, while the annual maximum value of

Abstract = {Arid and semi-arid environments have been identified with locations
   prone to impacts of climate variability and change. Investigating
   long-term trends is one way of tracing climate change impacts. This
   study investigates variability through annual and seasonal
   meteorological time series. Possible inhomogeneities and years of
   intervention are analysed using four absolute homogeneity tests. Trends
   in the climatic variables were determined using Mann-Kendall and Sen's
   Slope estimator statistics. Association of El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) with local climate is also investigated through multivariate
   analysis. Results from the study show that rainfall time series are
   fully homogeneous with 78.6 and 50\% of the stations for maximum and
   minimum temperature, respectively, showing homogeneity. Trends also
   indicate a general decrease of 5.8, 7.4 and 18.1\% in annual, summer and
   winter rainfall, respectively. Warming trends are observed in annual and
   winter temperature at 0.3 and 1.5\% for maximum temperature and 1.7 and
   6.5\% for minimum temperature, respectively. Rainfall reported a
   positive correlation with Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and at the
   same time negative association with Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs).
   Strong relationships between SSTs and maximum temperature are observed
   during the El Nino and La Nina years. These study findings could
   facilitate planning and management of agricultural and water resources
   in Botswana.},

Title = {Trends in Diurnal Temperature Range over India (1961-2010) and Their
   Relationship with Low Cloud Cover and Rainy Days},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {35-55},
Abstract = {A study has been carried out to analyze the annual and seasonal spatial
   patterns of trends in mean maximum temperature (MMAX), mean minimum
   temperature (MMIN) and diurnal temperature range (DTR = MMAX-MMIN) in
   India during 1961-2010. Additionally, we analyzed the spatial dependence
   of DTR trends on the low cloud cover (LCC) and number of rainy days
   (NRD). The study has revealed uneven changes in DTR across regions and
   time of the year in India. All India averaged annual MMAX and MMIN are
   increasing at the rate of 0.05 degrees C/decade but there is no trend in
   annual DTR. Seasonal averaged MMAX and MMIN are increasing for all
   seasons except MMIN in monsoon. But country averaged seasonal DTR is
   decreasing for winter and post monsoon mainly due to higher increases in
   MMIN or lesser decreases in MMAX, increasing for monsoon mainly due to
   higher increases in MMAX or lesser decreases in MMIN and showing no
   trend for summer during the period of study.
   Spatially, both MMAX and MMIN have increased all over India with the
   exception of northeastern region. However, DTR trends show a distinct
   contrast between northern and southern half of India. The amplitude of
   increase of MMIN compared to MMAX is high over north causing significant
   decrease in DTR. However, the amplitude of increase in MMAX compared to
   MMIN is high enough to cause significant increase in DTR in southern
   half of India. Stations in Western Himalayas show significant increase
   in DTR in all seasons except monsoon. MMAX trends in the Indo-Gangetic
   plains are significantly decreasing. The correlation analysis reveals
   that LCC and NRD are responsible for explaining much of the variance in
   DTR over India during the study period. Furthermore, local factors like
   land-use change, deforestation, urbanization, anthropogenic aerosols may
   also have contributed to the overall trends in DTR.},

Abstract = {Globally, few precipitation records extend to the 18th century. The
   England Wales Precipitation (EWP) series is a notable exception with
   continuous monthly records from 1766. EWP has found widespread use
   across diverse fields of research including trend detection, evaluation
   of climate model simulations, as a proxy for mid-latitude atmospheric
   circulation, a predictor in long-term European gridded precipitation
   data sets, the assessment of drought and extremes, tree-ring
   reconstructions and as a benchmark for other regional series. A key
   finding from EWP has been the multi-centennial trends towards wetter
   winters and drier summers. We statistically reconstruct seasonal EWP
   using independent, quality-assured temperature, pressure and circulation
   indices. Using a sleet and snow series for the UK derived by Profs.
   Gordon Manley and Elizabeth Shaw to examine winter reconstructions, we
   show that precipitation totals for pre-1870 winters are likely biased
   low due to gauge under-catch of snowfall and a higher incidence of
   snowfall during this period. When these factors are accounted for in our
   reconstructions, the observed trend to wetter winters in EWP is no
   longer evident. For summer, we find that pre-1820 precipitation totals
   are too high, likely due to decreasing network density and less certain
   data at key stations. A significant trend to drier summers is not
   robustly present in our reconstructions of the EWP series. While our
   findings are more certain for winter than summer, we highlight (a) that
   extreme caution should be exercised when using EWP to make inferences
   about multi-centennial trends, and; (b) that assessments of 18th and
   19th Century winter precipitation should be aware of potential snow
   biases in early records. Our findings underline the importance of
   continual re-appraisal of established long-term climate data sets as new
   evidence becomes available. It is also likely that the identified biases
   in winter EWP have distorted many other long-term European precipitation
   series.},

Abstract = {Rainfall and temperature are characterized by spatial and temporal
   variability in Ethiopia. However, less attention was given for the
   analysis of climate variability using advanced techniques and multiple
   sets of data. This study was conducted to examine spatiotemporal
   variability and trends in rainfall and temperature extremes in Ghibe III
   Dam watershed. Observational, ERA5, and regional simulation model data
   sets were used. The coefficient of variation (CV) and precipitation
   concentration index (PCI) were employed. The trends in rainfall and
   temperature extremes were examined using the modified Mann-Kendall test
   and the Sen Slope estimator in RClimDex in R 4.2.2 software. The warmest
   days exhibited temperature from 24.6 degrees C to 40 degrees C in Bele,
   28.2 degrees C to 35.43 degrees C in Wolaita Sodo, 33.6 degrees C-44
   degrees C in Areka, 31.64 degrees C-36.8 degrees C in Gesuba, and 29.19
   degrees C-36.15 degrees C in Gena Bosa. The warmest nights showed
   temperature ranging from 14 degrees C to 18.74 degrees C in Bele and
   Gena Bosa, respectively. Annual warm days (TX90p) ranges from 11.34 to
   57.1 days, with higher heating in the southern parts. The cool days
   (TX10p) range from 2.79 to 8.41, while the cool nights (TN10p) range
   from 0.04 to 8.26 days. The areal average temperature maximum and
   minimum range between 26.37 degrees C and 13.81 degrees C, respectively,
   with mean precipitation of 1446.92 mm.The rainfall extremes indices
   showed increasing and decreasing trends. The extreme temperature indices
   showed an overall warming trend. Based on ERA estimates, the rainfall in
   winter showed higher variability (CV = 72.4\%-99.3 \%) than the annual
   rainfall (CV = 33\%-79.8 \%). PCI showed a moderately (12 \%) to very
   erratic (19.4 \%) rainfall distribution. The climate model estimate
   showed high variability (CV = 20.65 \%) in Climate Limited Area Modeling
   Community (CCLM) under representative concentration paths (RCP) 4.5 and
   8.5 and extremely high variability (CV = 93.49 \%) in the Regional
   Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) under RCP 4.5. Policymakers should
   design appropriate adaptation strategies applicable to farmers.},

Abstract = {This study investigated trends in 35years (1979-2013) temperature
   (maximum, T-max and minimum, T-min) and rainfall at annual and seasonal
   (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter) scales for 31 grid
   points in a coastal arid region of India. Box-whisker plots of annual
   temperature and rainfall time series depict systematic spatial
   gradients. Trends were examined by applying eight tests, such as Kendall
   rank correlation (KRC), Spearman rank order correlation (SROC),
   Mann-Kendall (MK), four modified MK tests, and innovative trend analysis
   (ITA). Trend magnitudes were quantified by Sen's slope estimator, and a
   new method was adopted to assess the significance of linear trends in
   MK-test statistics. It was found that the significant serial correlation
   is prominent in the annual and post-monsoon T-max and T-min, and
   pre-monsoon T-min. The KRC and MK tests yielded similar results in close
   resemblance with the SROC test. The performance of two modified MK tests
   considering variance-correction approaches was found superior to the
   KRC, MK, modified MK with pre-whitening, and ITA tests. The performance
   of original MK test is poor due to the presence of serial correlation,
   whereas the ITA method is over-sensitive in identifying trends.
   Significantly increasing trends are more prominent in T-min than T-max.
   Further, both the annual and monsoon rainfall time series have a
   significantly increasing trend of 9mmyear(-1). The sequential
   significance of linear trend in MK test-statistics is very strong
   (R(2)0.90) in the annual and pre-monsoon T-min (90\% grid points), and
   strong (R(2)0.75) in monsoon T-max (68\% grid points), monsoon,
   post-monsoon, and winter T-min (respectively 65, 55, and 48\% grid
   points), as well as in the annual and monsoon rainfalls (respectively 68
   and 61\% grid points). Finally, this study recommends use of
   variance-corrected MK test for the precise identification of trends. It
   is emphasized that the rising T-max may hamper crop growth due to
   enhanced metabolic-activities and shortened crop-duration. Likewise,
   increased T-min may result in lesser crop and biomass yields owing to
   the increased respiration.},

Title = {Water Balance Backward: Estimation of Annual Watershed Precipitation and

   Complementary Relationship of Evaporation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Watershed-scale annual evapotranspiration (ET) is routinely estimated by
   a simplified water balance as the difference in catchment precipitation
   (P) and stream discharge (Q). With recent developments in ET estimation
   by the calibration-free generalized complementary relationship, the
   water balance equation is employed to estimate watershed/basin P at an
   annual scale as ET +Qon the United States (US) Geological Survey's
   Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 2- and 6-level watersheds over the 1979-2015
   period. On the HUC2 level, mean annual PRISMPwas estimated with a
   correlation coefficient (R) of 0.99, relative bias (RB) of zero,
   root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 54 mm yr(-1), ratio of standard
   deviations (RS) of 1.08, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.98. On
   the HUC6 level, R, RS, and NSE hardly changed, RB remained zero, while
   RMSE increased to 90 mm yr(-1). Even the long-term linear trend values
   were found to be fairly consistent between observed and estimated values
   with R = 0.97 (0.81), RMSE = 0.63 (1.63) mm yr(-1), RS = 0.99 (1.05),
   NSE = 0.92 (0.59) on the HUC2 and HUC6 (in parentheses) levels. This
   calibration-free water-balance method demonstrates that annual watershed
   precipitation can be estimated with an acceptable accuracy from standard
   atmospheric/radiation and stream discharge data.},

Title = {Microclimatic Variation in Miri Region (NW Borneo): Inference from
   Rainfall and Temperature Trends, Isotopic Signature and Air Mass
   Movement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {51-65},
Abstract = {Trend analysis is frequently utilised to identify the changes in
   meteorological and hydrologic time series data, such as rainfall and
   temperature. The variations in the intensity, rainfall pattern and
   temperature have gradually changed globally. Hence, in this study, an
   attempt was made to analyse the decadal rainfall and surface air
   temperature data to understand the microclimatic variations in the Miri
   coastal region of NW Borneo. A data series of records for daily total
   rainfall amount and daily surface temperature of 11 years from 2010 to
   2021 was studied and analysed. In addition, representative rainwater and
   groundwater samples were collected and analysed for hydrochemical
   parameters and oxygen and hydrogen isotopes. A detailed literature
   review was carried out on rainfall patterns in Malaysia, which was used
   for the comparative study. Interpretation of results shows that the
   northeast monsoon (NEM) contributed a higher total rainfall rate with
   lower daily mean surface air temperature over the years compared to the
   southwest monsoon (SWM). The recorded data for rainfall amounts in SWM
   for the month of May, July, August and September were higher,
   particularly for the years 2010 and 2020. During NEM, a higher rainfall
   amount was recorded in the month of January for several years. February
   month has always been among the driest month in NEM, and September has
   been the wettest month throughout the year during SWM. The isotopic
   values of rainwater indicate a similar moisture source to the regional
   precipitation trend. Groundwater isotopes reveal the low water-rock
   ratio of retrograde exchange between water and primary silicate minerals
   in the aquifer. The moisture source of the precipitation was contributed
   from both oceanic and continent, affecting the rainfall intensity in
   this region. This study is a crucial outcome to determine the potential
   impacts of microclimatic variations on the rainfall patterns in the Miri
   coastal region.},

Title = {Continental-scale trends of daily precipitation records in late 20th

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},

Pages = {7003-7017},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {We apply a methodology to identify and count records (events of
   unprecedented intensity) in daily precipitation time series to two sets
   of data: (1) different observational and reanalysis products for recent
   decades and (2) twenty-first century projections (RCP8.5 and RCP2.6
   scenarios) completed with two regional climate models driven by three
   global climate models over nine continental-scale domains. Comparison of
   the detected (or actual) number of records with the corresponding number
   theoretically expected in stationary climate conditions (or
   ``reference{''} number of records) provides indications of trends in
   daily precipitation extremes, as expected in a changing climate. In
   particular, we measure deviations from stationary conditions using the
   ratio of actual to reference records (RAtR) as a basic metric. We find
   that the observational products provide mixed indications of
   precipitation record trends across regions, while in the reanalysis
   products and the model simulations for the historical period the RAtR
   value shows a prevailing increasing trend with time over most
   continents. The RAtR shows a consistent and pronounced increase in all
   RCP8.5 continental-scale projections, when sustained warming occurs
   throughout the 21st century, while smaller to no significant trends are
   found in the RCP2.6 scenario, when the warming stabilizes after about
   mid-21st century. These results are indicative of an increase in
   precipitation extremes with global warming as measured by the higher
   number of local precipitation events of unprecedented intensity compared
   to what expected in stationary climate conditions, although a marked
   variability of this response is found across different regions. Our
   method can have useful applications in detection and attribution of
   hydroclimatic extremes and in impact and vulnerability assessment
   studies.},

Title = {Understanding Growth-Induced Trends in Local Climate Zones, Land Surface
   Temperature, and Extreme Temperature Events in a Rapidly Growing City: A
   Case of Bulawayo Metropolitan City in Zimbabwe},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Assessment of the responses of the urban thermal environment to climate
   is important, especially because of their possible influence on low- and
   high-temperature extreme events. This study assessed the combination of
   remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and local climate zones
   (LCZs) with in situ air temperature-retrieved extreme temperature
   indices. It aimed to assess the effect of urban growth on the
   three-dimensional thermal environment in the Bulawayo metropolitan area,
   Zimbabwe. LST and LCZ were derived from the Landsat data for 1990, 2005,
   and 2020, while extreme temperature indices and trends were derived from
   daily minimum and maximum temperature data from a local weather station.
   Results showed that the built LCZ expanded at the expense of
   vegetation-based LCZ. Average LST for each LCZ increased from 1990 to
   2020, which was attributed to background warming, while the expansion of
   high LST areas was associated with LCZ transitions. Although average
   minimum temperature decreased, cool nights increased, warmest nights
   remained unchanged, and the lowest minimum increased, the highest
   minimum temperatures decreased, but the trends were not statistically
   significant (p > 0.05). Indices of daytime warming showed significant
   changes, which includes an increase in average maximum temperature (p =
   0.002), increase in lowest maximum temperature (p = 0), increase in the
   number of very warm days (p = 0.004), and decrease in the number of cool
   days (p = 0). The significant increase in daytime extremes was
   attributed to an increase in highly absorbing LCZ and daytime pollution
   due to industrial activities. The study also concluded that development
   in water areas or siltation of water bodies has a greater warming effect
   than other LCZ changes. The findings show that development needs to
   consider potential effects on the thermal environment and temperature
   extremes.},

Title = {Trends and abrupt changes in 104 years of ice cover and water
   temperature in a dimictic lake in response to air temperature, wind
   speed, and water clarity drivers},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1681-1702},
Abstract = {The one-dimensional hydrodynamic ice model, DYRESM-WQ-I, was modified to
   simulate ice cover and thermal structure of dimictic Lake Mendota,
   Wisconsin, USA, over a continuous 104-year period (1911-2014). The model
   results were then used to examine the drivers of changes in ice cover
   and water temperature, focusing on the responses to shifts in air
   temperature, wind speed, and water clarity at multiyear timescales.
   Observations of the drivers include a change in the trend of warming air
   temperatures from 0.081 degrees C per decade before 1981 to 0.334
   degrees C per decade thereafter, as well as a shift in mean wind speed
   from 4.44 ms(-1) before 1994 to 3.74 ms(-1) thereafter. Observations
   show that Lake Mendota has experienced significant changes in ice cover:
   later ice-on date(9.0 days later per century), earlier ice-off date
   (12.3 days per century), decreasing ice cover duration (21.3 days per
   century), while model simulations indicate a change in maximum ice
   thickness (12.7 cm decrease per century). Model simulations also show
   changes in the lake thermal regime of earlier stratification onset (12.3
   days per century), later fall turnover (14.6 days per century), longer
   stratification duration (26.8 days per century), and decreasing summer
   hypolimnetic temperatures (-1.4 degrees C per century). Correlation
   analysis of lake variables and driving variables revealed ice cover
   variables, stratification onset, epilimnetic temperature, and
   hypolimnetic temperature were most closely correlated with air
   temperature, whereas freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic
   heating, and fall turnover date were more closely correlated with wind
   speed. Each lake variable (i.e., ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover
   duration, maximum ice thickness, freeze-over water temperature,
   stratification onset, fall turnover date, stratification duration,
   epilimnion temperature, hypolimnion temperature, and hypolimnetic
   heating) was averaged for the three periods (1911-1980, 1981-1993, and
   1994-2014) delineated by abrupt changes in air temperature and wind
   speed. Average summer hypolimnetic temperature and fall turnover date
   exhibit significant differences between the third period and the first
   two periods. Changes in ice cover (ice-on and ice-off dates, ice cover
   duration, and maximum ice thickness) exhibit an abrupt change after
   1994, which was related in part to the warm El Nino winter of 1997-1998.
   Under-ice water temperature, freeze-over water temperature, hypolimnetic
   temperature, fall turnover date, and stratification duration demonstrate
   a significant difference in the third period (1994-2014), when air
   temperature was warmest and wind speeds decreased rather abruptly. The
   trends in ice cover and water temperature demonstrate responses to both
   long-term and abrupt changes in meteorological conditions that can be
   complemented with numerical modeling to better understand how these
   variables will respond in a future climate.},

Abstract = {The current manuscript presents the spatial analysis of the temperature
   trends during India's Rabi and Kharif cropping seasons. We investigated
   the district-level temperature trends from 1966 to 2015 using Climate
   Research Unit data. All the 666 Indian districts showed significant
   upward temperature trends for the Rabi season. This upward trend was
   contributed by a significant rise in monthly temperatures during
   November (645 districts), December (664 districts), February (659
   districts), and March (626 districts). January had the minimum number of
   Indian districts with a significant upward temperature trend during the
   Rabi season (322 districts). For the Kharif season, 640 Indian districts
   showed significant upward temperature trends. Significant rise in
   monthly temperatures during August (622 districts), September (595
   districts), and October (627 districts) contributed to this upward
   trend. June (296 districts) and July (411 districts) had fewer districts
   with significant upward temperature trends. The results reflect a severe
   challenge of rising temperatures during India's cropping seasons.},

Abstract = {CO2 utilization technologies can not only provide a pathway to reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions but may also enable renewable energy to be
   incorporated into important materials used in the society such as fuel
   and chemicals. Power to gas (PtG) technologies, especially Power to
   methane has been deemed as one of the promising pathways for the
   conversion of CO2 into valuable gaseous fuel. Many reports have reviewed
   the academic literature related to CO2 methanation. While the benefits
   of high temperature methanation for overall process efficiency are well
   understood, the potential for low-temperature methanation is less
   understood. In particular the opportunities that arise from coupling a
   low-temperature methanation process with low temperature hydrogen
   production technologies, such as PEM electrolysis, have received little
   attention. It is therefore considered valuable to provide a critical
   review of the state of the art of this technology at low temperature
   conditions for the interests of broader research community. In this
   paper we focus on the recent work around low temperature CO2 methanation
   including reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, catalyst materials
   including supports and promoters, and suitable reactor technologies. We
   discuss each of these critical aspects of the technology and identify
   key challenges and opportunities for low temperature CO2 methanation
   (methanation conducted at temperatures less than 300 degrees C). As part
   of this paper, we also present the results of an ASPEN Plus simulation
   study based on data available from the literature to highlight the
   potential energy efficiency gains of a low temperature methanation
   process.},

Abstract = {Lakes are a prominent geographic feature in northern landscapes and play
   an important role in understanding regional climate systems. In order to
   better model changes within climate systems, it is important to study
   lake ice processes. Although the availability of records for lake ice
   through ground measurements has declined in recent years, the increased
   use of remote sensing provides an alternative to this. Using a
   preclassified snow and ice remote sensing product with a 500-m
   resolution, based on images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS/MOD10A1), and the use of measured and
   reanalysis temperature data, this study evaluated lake ice phenology
   dates in connection to recent trends in temperature and 0 degrees C
   isotherms within Ontario and Manitoba between 2001 and 2014. Temperature
   trends indicated both regional warming and cooling, with significant
   cooling observed in Southern Ontario (p<.05) and significant warming in
   Southern Manitoba (p<.1) during the fall. Spatial analysis of the trends
   in the lake ice data showed significant clustering of significant trends
   in ice on dates (p<.01). When analysing the trends in ice phenology in
   connection to the trends in temperature, it was found that 70\% of lakes
   experienced a change in the ice on date with the expected change in
   temperature and 85\% of lakes for ice off date. When shifting ice on and
   ice off dates are investigated in relation to 0 degrees C isotherms, it
   was seen that 80\% of ice on dates and 100\% of ice off dates shifted in
   sync with the isotherm dates. This demonstrates that the ice phenology
   of lakes in Ontario and Manitoba, Canada, is responding to short-term
   variability in temperature. The MODIS product could be used to
   investigate ice phenology on a large scale and contribute towards
   expanding existing records of ice phenology. Establishing long-term ice
   records could be a valuable asset for other research ranging from water
   balance studies to the response of lake biota under changing climate.},

Title = {Physical Mechanisms of Tropical Climate Feedbacks Investigated Using
   Temperature and Moisture Trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {28},
Number = {22},
Pages = {8968-8987},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Tropical climate feedback mechanisms are assessed using
   satellite-observed and model-simulated trends in tropical tropospheric
   temperature from the MSU/AMSU instruments and upper-tropospheric
   humidity from the HIRS instruments. Despite discrepancies in the rates
   of tropospheric warming between observations and models, both are
   consistent with constant relative humidity over the period 1979-2008.
   Because uncertainties in satellite-observed tropical-mean trends
   preclude a constraint on tropical-mean trends in models regional
   features of the feedbacks are also explored. The regional pattern of the
   lapse rate feedback is primarily determined by the regional pattern of
   surface temperature changes, as tropical atmospheric warming is
   relatively horizontally uniform. The regional pattern of the water vapor
   feedback is influenced by the regional pattern of precipitation changes,
   with variations of 1-2 W m(-2) K-1 across the tropics (compared to a
   tropical-mean feedback magnitude of 3.3-4 W m(-2) K-1). Thus the
   geographical patterns of water vapor and lapse rate feedbacks are not
   correlated, but when the feedbacks are calculated in precipitation
   percentiles rather than in geographical space they are anticorrelated,
   with strong positive water vapor feedback associated with strong
   negative lapse rate feedback. The regional structure of the feedbacks is
   not related to the strength of the tropical-mean feedback in a subset of
   the climate models from the CMIP5 archive. Nevertheless the approach
   constitutes a useful process-based test of climate models and has the
   potential to be extended to constrain regional climate projections.},

Title = {Global and regional sea surface temperature trends during Marine Isotope
   Stage 11},
Journal = {CLIMATE OF THE PAST},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2231-2252},
Abstract = {The Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (424-374 ka) was characterized by a
   protracted deglaciation and an unusually long climatic optimum. It
   remains unclear to what degree the climate development during this
   interglacial reflects the unusually weak orbital forcing or greenhouse
   gas trends. Previously, arguments about the duration and timing of the
   MIS11 climatic optimum and about the pace of the deglacial warming were
   based on a small number of key records, which appear to show regional
   differences. In order to obtain a global signal of climate evolution
   during MIS11, we compiled a database of 78 sea surface temperature (SST)
   records from 57 sites spanning MIS11, aligned these individually on the
   basis of benthic (N = 28) or planktonic (N = 31) stable oxygen isotope
   curves to a common time frame and subjected 48 of them to an empirical
   orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The analysis revealed a high
   commonality among all records, with the principal SST trend explaining
   almost 49\% of the variability. This trend indicates that on the global
   scale, the surface ocean underwent rapid deglacial warming during
   Termination V, in pace with carbon dioxide rise, followed by a broad SST
   optimum centered at similar to 410 kyr. The second EOF, which explained
   similar to 18\% of the variability, revealed the existence of a
   different SST trend, characterized by a delayed onset of the temperature
   optimum during MIS11 at similar to 398 kyr, followed by a prolonged warm
   period lasting beyond 380 kyr. This trend is most consistently
   manifested in the mid-latitude North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea and
   is here attributed to the strength of the Atlantic meridional
   overturning circulation. A sensitivity analysis indicates that these
   results are robust to record selection and to age-model uncertainties of
   up to 3-6 kyr, but more sensitive to SST seasonal attribution and SST
   uncertainties >1 degrees C. In order to validate the CCSM3 (Community
   Climate System Model, version 3) predictive potential, the annual and
   seasonal SST anomalies recorded in a total of 74 proxy records were
   compared with runs for three time slices representing orbital
   configuration extremes during the peak interglacial of MIS11. The
   modeled SST anomalies are characterized by a significantly lower
   variance compared to the reconstructions. Nevertheless, significant
   correlations between proxy and model data are found in comparisons on
   the seasonal basis, indicating that the model captures part of the
   long-term variability induced by astronomical forcing, which appears to
   have left a detectable signature in SST trends.},

Abstract = {Continued urban expansion undergone in the last decades has converted
   many weather stations in Thailand into suburban and urban setting. Based
   on homogenio data during 1970-2019, therefore, this study examines
   urbanization effects on mean surface air temperature (Tmean) trends in
   Thailand. Analysis shows that urban-type stations register the strongest
   warming trends while rural-type stations exhibit the smallest trends.
   Across Thailand, annual urban-warming contribution exhibits a wide range
   (< 5\% to 77\%), probably manifesting the Urban Heat Island (UHI)
   differences from city to city resulting from the varied urban
   characteristics and climatic background. Country-wide average urban
   warming contribution shows a significant increasing trend of 0.15 oC per
   decade, accounting for 40.5\% of the overall warming. This evidence
   indicates that urban expansion has great influence on surface warming,
   and the urban-warming bias contributes large fraction of rising
   temperature trends in Thailand. The increasing trend of annual Tmean for
   Thailand as a whole after adjusting urban-warming bias is brought down
   to the same rate as the annual global mean temperature trend, reflecting
   a national baseline signal driven by large-scale anthropogenic-induced
   climate change. Our results provide a scientific reference for policy
   makers and urban planners to mitigate substantial fraction of the UHI
   warming.},

Abstract = {The soil temperature trend at Hveravellir, a weather station in the
   Icelandic highlands, is investigated. Hveravellir is stationed in a
   barren landscape but the site itself is grass covered. The maritime
   climate of Iceland is warmer than expected for the latitude and the
   annual temperature at Hveravellir, at 641 m a.s.l., is 0.3 degrees C.
   Soil temperature has been measured at the site since 1965 at 10, 20, 50
   and 100 cm depth but the data is not fully digitized. Here, the time
   series used span 42 years, from 1977 to 2019. Annual and seasonal trends
   are calculated as well as the annual number of thawing degree days (TDD)
   and freezing degree days (FDD). During this period, there has been a
   considerable warming in Iceland, not only because of global warming but
   also because of its start coinciding with the end of a local cold
   period. In the soil, warming is detected in all seasons except May to
   June, which is the melting season, the end of which varies greatly from
   year to year. The most warming is found during the autumn and winter
   months. These results contrast with those from continental cool sites
   where the largest warming has been seen in the spring months. The autumn
   cooling starts 2-3 weeks later now than at the start of the time series,
   resulting in the soil experiencing a longer summer. The number of TDD
   has increased and the number of FDD has decreased, both in air and in
   soil. At 100 cm depth TDD has increased by 80 degrees C day dec(-1) and
   FDD decreased by 38 degrees C day dec(-1). There is a correlation
   between the increase in air temperature and soil temperature, for every
   1 degrees C increase in 2 m temperature the soil temperature at 100 cm
   has increased by 0.6 degrees C.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of data has been made for understanding likely
   temperature changes. This study was conducted at Shaheed Gundadhoor
   College of Agriculture and Research Station, Jagdalpur (Chattisgarh)
   under NICRA project by analysing 32 years (1980-2011) daily weather data
   of Jagdalpur station for Bastar region (Chattisgarh) through weather
   cock software developed by CR1DA, Hyderabad. The analysis showed that
   number of days recorded under different ranges of maximum temperature is
   not in increasing pattern in this region. However, number of days
   recorded under different ranges of winter seasonal minimum temperature
   values are in significantly increasing pattern showing cooling trend.
   Number of days with minimum temperature <= 10 degrees C is found
   increasing in the months of December and January and statistically
   significant at 1 per cent level. Number of days with <= 7 degrees C
   showed cooling trend in the months of December, January and February.
   Analysis of maximum temperature crossing certain threshold values >= 40
   degrees C, >= 41 degrees C, >= 42 degrees C, >= 43 degrees C done lead
   to conclusion that trends shown by linear equations are all
   non-significant, indicating that number of such days are not on the
   increase. However, as an exception, maximum temperature crossed value of
   40 degrees C in March 1996; in May 2003, there were 23 days which
   crossed 40 degrees C and June 2003 was comparatively warmer with 12 days
   crossing 40 degrees C, out of which 6 days crossed 41 degrees C.},

Title = {A quantification of uncertainties in historical tropical tropospheric
   temperature trends from radiosondes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {The consistency of tropical tropospheric temperature trends with climate
   model expectations remains contentious. A key limitation is that the
   uncertainties in observations from radiosondes are both substantial and
   poorly constrained. We present a thorough uncertainty analysis of
   radiosonde-based temperature records. This uses an automated
   homogenization procedure and a previously developed set of complex error
   models where the answer is known a priori. We perform a number of
   homogenization experiments in which error models are used to provide
   uncertainty estimates of real-world trends. These estimates are
   relatively insensitive to a variety of processing choices. Over
   1979-2003, the satellite-equivalent tropical lower tropospheric
   temperature trend has likely (5-95\% confidence range) been between
   -0.01 K/decade and 0.19 K/decade (0.05-0.23 K/decade over 1958-2003)
   with a best estimate of 0.08 K/decade (0.14 K/decade). This range
   includes both available satellite data sets and estimates from models
   (based upon scaling their tropical amplification behavior by observed
   surface trends). On an individual pressure level basis, agreement
   between models, theory, and observations within the troposphere is
   uncertain over 1979 to 2003 and nonexistent above 300 hPa. Analysis of
   1958-2003, however, shows consistent model-data agreement in tropical
   lapse rate trends at all levels up to the tropical tropopause, so the
   disagreement in the more recent period is not necessarily evidence of a
   general problem in simulating long-term global warming. Other possible
   reasons for the discrepancy since 1979 are: observational errors beyond
   those accounted for here, end-point effects, inadequate decadal
   variability in model lapse rates, or neglected climate forcings.},

Title = {Temperature trends and interannual variability in the Strait of Georgia,
   British Columbia},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {27},
Number = {5},
Pages = {634-649},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {A continuous 36 year long record of semi-monthly temperature profiles
   from the central Strait of Georgia, British Columbia is used to examine
   low frequency variability and trends through the water column.
   Decomposition of temperature anomalies into empirical orthogonal
   functions shows that the dominant mode accounts for 78\% of the
   variance, while the principal component associated with this mode (PC1)
   is dominated by fluctuations on interannual time scales. To relate the
   variability within the Strait to that occurring over the northeast
   Pacific, PC1 is compared with anomalies in local air temperature, sea
   surface temperatures off the west coast of Vancouver Island, and upper
   ocean temperatures along Line-P. These comparisons suggest that much of
   the interannual variability observed in the Strait of Georgia occurs in
   response to large-scale atmospheric forcing over the northeast Pacific.
   However, following tropical El Nino events there are significant
   anomalies associated with processes occurring along the coastal oceanic
   wave guide. The strongest event in the entire record, the remarkable
   negative temperature anomaly of winter 1978/1979, appears to be
   associated with a deep water intrusion that was forced locally.
   A warming trend is observed over the period 1970-2005 through the entire
   water column of the Strait of Georgia, with a depth-averaged value of
   0.024 degrees C yr(-1). The vertical variation of the linear trend in
   temperature is contrasted with trends observed through the upper water
   column in the adjoining northeast Pacific over the same time period.
   Comparable trends are observed within the upper 100 in of the water
   column. However, at greater depths trends in the Strait of Georgia
   exceed those observed offshore by a factor of two. This is likely a
   consequence of the entrainment of near-surface waters into the deep
   Strait by the estuarine circulation. The results illustrate how global
   climatic changes may be amplified at depth in a coastal sea. (c) 2006

Title = {A CMIP6 Analysis of Past and Future Arctic Winter Stratospheric
   Temperature Trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {129},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Reanalysis data reveal a weak warming trend in the midwinter Arctic
   stratosphere, contrary to the cooling expectation based on the
   greenhouse gas effect. This trend is also influenced by the occurrence
   of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). Using Phase 6 of the Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) we investigate temperature trends
   over a similar timescale as ERA5 and find that CMIP6 models can
   replicate the positive midwinter temperature trend in the mid-lower
   stratosphere. However, when considering the multi-model mean, this
   positive temperature trend is much weaker than ERA5. Extrapolating to
   the future, we find that the SSW-driven positive temperature trend will
   likely not continue in the future based on the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5
   climate scenarios. Instead, the models project there will be widespread
   cooling throughout the Arctic winter stratosphere regardless of the
   occurrence of SSWs. Using a subsample of CMIP6 models which replicate
   the seasonality of the Arctic winter stratosphere most similarly to that
   of ERA5, we also find that the zonal wind strength during SSWs
   correlates the most with the temperature trends found there. However,
   trends in the zonal wind strength alone cannot account for the observed
   temperature trends among the CMIP6 models.
   During the 1980-2019 period, the temperature in the mid-lower Arctic
   winter stratosphere has been increasing while the rest of the
   stratosphere has been cooling. More interestingly, when this period is
   filtered according to years with and without sudden stratospheric
   warmings (SSWs), an event associated with a remarkable disruption to the
   stratospheric circulation and impressive temperature increases, it has
   been found that the years in which sudden warming events occur are
   driving the observed temperature trends. To determine if this positive
   temperature trend will continue in the future, this work uses climate
   models. We find that a positive temperature trend will not continue in
   the future. Instead, it is more likely that there will be widespread
   cooling throughout the winter Arctic stratosphere, regardless of the
   occurrence of SSWs. We also find that the strength of the zonal wind in
   the Arctic stratosphere is an important consideration when discussing
   the temperature trends. However, trends in the zonal wind strength alone
   cannot account for the observed temperature trends found in the Arctic
   winter stratosphere.
   A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW)-induced ``cooling hole{''}, or
   rather a weak warming trend, is observed in the wintertime Arctic
   stratosphereGCMs replicate this SSW-influenced lack-of-cooling
   phenomenon in their historical simulationsGCMs project the warming to be

Title = {Daily temperature extremes over Egypt: Spatial patterns, temporal
   trends, and driving forces},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal changes of daily temperature extremes are
   investigated over Egypt using a standard set of 23 indices. Our analysis
   uses a database consisting of complete, high quality and homogenous
   daily maximum and minimum air temperature records at 40 stations,
   spanning the period from 1983 to 2015. The trends were assessed using a
   least squares regression model, and its significance was determined by
   means of the modified Mann-Kendall test (p < .05). Results demonstrate
   that the frequency, intensity, and persistence of warm extremes
   increased significantly over the study period, with a clear spatial
   gradient from southeast to northwest. The strongest warming was more
   evident in coastal areas along the Red Sea and the Sinai Peninsula. In
   contrast, changes in cold extremes were mostly non-significant, with a
   divergence in the trends (i.e. positive and negative). Changes in
   variability indices such as the diurnal temperature range (DTR) were
   more consistent with those of warm extremes than with cold extremes. Our
   results also demonstrate that maximum air temperature witnessed stronger
   warming than minimum air temperature, leading to a dramatic increase in
   DTR, especially in the last decade. This study also points at the
   possible physical mechanisms responsible for the detectable changes in
   temperature extremes using sea level pressure and geopotential field
   data. Results indicate that anomalous warm events over Egypt are
   directly related to easterly winds that bring warm and dry air from the
   Arabian Peninsula and the Iranian Plateau, accompanied by strong ridges
   over the eastern Mediterranean and an intensification of the Asian
   monsoon lows. On the other hand, the occurrence of anomalous cold events
   can be linked to the east-west pressure gradient between the North
   Atlantic Highs and the Siberian and Persian Troughs, which enhances a
   northerly and northwesterly cold advection from Northern Europe to
   Egypt. This situation is also combined with a subsidence of cooler air
   from the mid to low troposphere. Overall, the observed changes in warm
   extremes could have profound ecological, hydrological and socioeconomic
   impacts, especially for crop production, water resources management and
   energy consumption. As such, improving the insight and understanding of
   such changes is of considerable importance to provide guidance to
   policymakers and stakeholders to develop more appropriate adaptation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {City's ecological monitoring it is a problem with which a lot of city's
   are faced today. There no one solution that can solve all the problems.
   This problem include greenery monitoring, city growth monitoring, air
   quality monitoring, water monitoring and soil monitoring. All this
   aspects are combined in Nexus approach that have specific for city's
   use. Remote sensing approach gives applicable data source for city's
   ecological characteristics monitoring and forecasting. Ukraine can use
   world experience in remote sensing data. In this work, remote sensing
   approach was used within the Public initiative ``Trees with stories in
   Rivne{''}, and it includes the analysis of the condition of urban trees,
   the land surface temperature for the city, city planning, comparison
   with the city of Lublin and city's state tends analysis. For this task
   were used satellite images of Sentinel-2 to build land cover
   classification maps and vegetative NDVI indices, satellite images of
   Landsat-8 used to build land surface temperature maps and increase the
   time series of vegetation index by 2014 for trends calculation. The
   analysis showed poor condition of green plantations, high summer average
   land surface temperature and deterioration of these indicators it

Title = {Assessment of Historical Climate Trends of Surface Air Temperature in

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {137-142},
Abstract = {This study assesses the historical climate trends of surface air
   temperature (SAT), their spatial distributions, and the hindcast skills
   for SAT during 19012000 from 24 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. For the global averaged SAT, most of the models
   (17/24) effectively captured the increasing trends (0.64 degrees
   C/century for the ensemble mean) as the observed values (similar to 0.6
   degrees C/century) during the period of 1901-2000, particularly during a
   rapid warming period of 1970-2000 with the small model spread. In
   addition, most of the models (22/24) showed high hindcast skills (the
   correlation coefficient, R > 0.8). For the spatial pattern of SAT, the
   models better simulated the relatively larger warming at the
   middle-to-high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere than that in the
   Southern Hemisphere and the greater warming on the land than that in the
   ocean between 40 degrees S and 40 degrees N. The simulations
   underestimated the warming along some ocean boundaries but overestimated
   warming in the Arctic Ocean. Most of the coupled models were able to
   reproduce the large-scale features of SAT trends in most regions
   excluding Antarctica, some parts of the Pacific Ocean, the North
   Atlantic Ocean near Greenland, the southwestern Indian Ocean, and the
   Arctic Ocean. The outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and incoming
   shortwave radiation (ISR) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the
   downward longwave (LW) radiation and sensible heat flux at the surface
   had positive contributions to the increasing trends in most of the
   models.},

Title = {Hydraulic management drives heat budgets and temperature trends in a

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {93},

Pages = {131-147},
Abstract = {By contrast to the more regular and predictable temperate lakes, heat
   budgets and temperature dynamics in Mediterranean reservoirs are
   characterized by a marked interannual variability. In the present paper,
   the heat content, annual Birgean heat budget (ABHB), and thermal
   structure of San Reservoir were examined during a period of hypolimnetic
   withdrawal between 1980 and 1985, and during a period of withdrawal at
   intermediate depths between 1996 and 2003. The two study periods were
   also characterized by a wide range of stored water volume fluctuations.
   Results were used to develop and validate an empirical model to predict
   annual and monthly heat dynamics statistics and mixed layer depth as a
   function of hydraulic management parameters such as water volume and
   selective withdrawal depth. During the hypolimnetic withdrawal period
   elevated ABHB and deep mixed layer depths were recorded in the
   reservoir, which behaved as a heat trap. By contrast, intermediate depth
   withdrawal promoted a shallower and more stable thermocline, thus
   increasing the cold hypolimnetic water volume and decreasing heat
   content and ABHB. The study reveals that hydraulic management
   constitutes the main driver of the beat and thermal dynamics in
   reservoirs with multiple withdrawal outlets. By contrast with the
   increasing temperature trends recorded in many natural lakes, the
   hydraulic management in San Reservoir induced a progressive reduction in
   water temperature and heat content in the system, thus partially
   counteracting the possible deleterious effects of global warming. Our
   intensive study in a single, highly-dynamic ecosystem constitutes a new
   approximation to the study of thermal structure and heat dynamics in
   water bodies.},

   Multimodel Ensemble},

Abstract = {This study conducts a robust assessment of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 6 to capture the observed temperature
   trends and variability at global and regional scales. The warming rate
   in the second half of the twentieth century (0.19 degrees C/decade) is
   twice as large as in the full analysis period (1901-2014; 0.10 degrees
   C/decade). Multidecadal climate variability results in considerable
   uncertainties in the regional temperature trend, but the multidecadal
   variability does not represent a statistically significant trend.
   Globally, the spatial pattern of trends is most similar among ensemble
   members of the same model, then among climate models, and the least
   similar between models and observations. The structural uncertainty and
   internal variability of climate models provide a range of temperature
   trends that generally encompass the regional scale observations. Some
   single model large ensembles also have variability comparable to the
   multimodel large ensemble, encompassing the regional scale observations.},

Abstract = {The morphologies at elevated temperatures (T > T-g, T-m,) of 12 precise,
   polyethylene (PE)-based copolymers with acrylic acid (AA), phosphonic
   acid (PA), and 1-methylimidazolium bromide (1mBr) groups were studied
   via X-ray scattering. These precise copolymers enable direct comparisons
   focusing on the length of the spacer between the functional groups and
   the type of functional group. The polar groups in these materials
   self-assemble into microphase-separated aggregates dispersed throughout
   the nonpolar PE matrix. At high temperatures the PE segments are
   amorphous, such that the aggregates are distributed in a liquid-like
   manner in 11 of these precise copolymers. The correlation distances
   between aggregates increase with the following: carbon spacer length
   between pendant groups, size and volume fraction of the pendant species,
   and functional group configuration (single vs geminal substitution). In
   addition, comparisons are made between precise copolymers and
   pseudorandom copolymers of the same pendant concentration, wherein the
   interaggregate distances are much better defined with precise
   copolymers. Finally, the local packing in copolymers with geminal
   substitution of PA pendant groups is less compact, which might
   facilitate ion conduction.},

Title = {Comparing variability and trends in observed and modelled global-mean
   surface temperature},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {The observed evolution of the global-mean surface temperature over the
   twentieth century reflects the combined influences of natural variations
   and anthropogenic forcing, and it is a primary goal of climate models to
   represent both. In this study we isolate, compare, and remove the
   following natural signals in observations and in climate models:
   dynamically induced atmospheric variability, the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation, and explosive volcanic eruptions. We make clear the
   significant model-to-model variability in estimates of the variance in
   global-mean temperature associated with these natural signals,
   especially associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and
   explosive volcanic eruptions. When these natural signals are removed
   from time series of global-mean temperature, the statistical uncertainty
   in linear trends from 1950 to 2000 drops on average by about half.
   Hence, the results make much clearer than before where some model
   estimates of global warming significantly deviate from observations and
   where others do not. Citation: Fyfe, J. C., N. P. Gillett, and D. W. J.

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {We investigated two unusual systematic normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI) growing season trends in Newfoundland from 1982 to 1999
   within a satellite data record from 1982 to 2003 and attempted to
   determine their causes. We found direct correlations between increasing
   NDVI and increasing surface air temperature for the 1982-1990 and
   1991-1999 growing seasons, punctuated by sharp simultaneous decreases in
   both surface temperature and the NDVI in 1991 from 1990 that were
   associated with the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. No covarying
   trend between NDVI and surface air temperatures was found from 2000 to
   2003. The responses of increasing plant growth, as indicated by the
   increasing NDVI, to increasing surface air temperature from 1982 to 1990
   and 1991 to 1999, were also associated with a lengthening of the growing
   seasons of similar to 9 and similar to 17 days for these two periods,
   respectively. We found no systematic variations in precipitation, the
   presence of early season and late season snow cover, systematic
   variation in down-welling photosynthetically-active radiation,
   post-forest fire succession, regrowth following logging of coniferous
   forests, and other land use changes that contributed to the 1982-1990
   and 1991-1999 increasing NDVI trends. Our results document the
   influences of surface air temperature upon boreal forest plant growth
   and the cooling effects of major volcanic eruptions in this ecological
   system.},

   (1999) and Vinnikov et al. (1994) in the context of the multivariate

   We find that, across all seasons, global warming seems to be present for

   within hemispheres, it appears that seasons are not warming equally
   fast. In particular, winters appear to be warming faster than summers.
   Across hemispheres, it appears that the winters in the northern and
   southern hemispheres are warming equally fast whereas the remaining
   seasons appear to have unequal warming rates. The results obtained here
   seem to coincide with the findings of Kauftnann and Stem (2002) who use
   cointegration analysis and find that the hemispheres are warming at
   different rates.},

Abstract = {The impacts of agricultural expansion on wetlands are diverse and
   complex. Land surface temperature (LST) has a great potential to act as
   a global indicator of the status of wetlands and changes in their
   hydrological and evapotranspiration regimes, which are often linked to
   land use and cover changes. We use the whole MODIS LST archive
   (2000-2017) to perform time series analysis in the Kilombero catchment,
   Tanzania; a large wetland that has experienced major land conversions to
   agriculture during the last two decades. We estimated pixel based trends
   using three models: a seasonal trend model, and aggregated time series
   using annual means and percentile 90. We characterized the trends found
   by using land cover change maps derived from Landsat imagery and a
   post-classification comparison. The relation between Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST trends was also studied (r =
   - 0.56). The results given by the seasonal trend model and annual means
   were similar (r = 0.81). Fewer significant trends were found using the
   percentile 90, and these had larger magnitudes. Positive LST trends
   (i.e. increasing) corresponded to deforestation and farmland expansion
   into the floodplain, while forestation processes resulted in negative
   LST trends. Moderate increases of LST in natural wetlands suggest that
   the impacts of human activities extend also into non-cultivated areas.
   We provide evidence of how time series analysis of LST data can be
   successfully used to monitor and study changes in wetland ecosystems at
   regional and local scales.},

Abstract = {Airborne pollen concentration patterns reflect flowering phenology of a
   given species, and it may be a sensitive regional indicator in climate
   change studies. This paper presents the relationship between a strategic
   biological event, such as olive flowering, and the air temperature
   trend, registered over a large scale (1982-2007) in the Umbria region.
   The aim of the study was to determine relationships between phenological
   behaviour (flowering) of olive trees and the air temperature trend
   (1982-2007) in the Umbria region. The phenological data on flowering
   phase were registered indirectly through an aerobiological monitoring
   technique. The obtained results showed a strong relationship between
   phenology and thermal trend. This characteristic was confirmed from
   results of correlations between temperature (mean temperature from 1st
   March) and flowering dates, especially that of full flowering (r =
   -0.9297). Moreover, the results showed an advance trend of 6, 8 and 10
   days, respectively of start, full and end of flowering dates. The
   advance of the recorded flowering time in this period is to ascribe
   mainly to the increase of mean temperature and above all to that
   registered in months of May and June.},

Title = {Gastrointestinal Temperature Trends in Football Linemen During Physical

Volume = {102},

Abstract = {Context: Exertional heat stroke is the third leading cause of death in
   US athletes. Elevations in core temperature in the digestive tract
   (T(GI)) have correlated with core temperature and are possible
   indicators of those at increased risk of heat stroke.
   Objective: The primary objective was to compare a.m. vs. p.m. T(GI)
   variation in collegiate football linemen during intense ``two-a-day{''}
   preseason practice. A secondary objective was to compare longitudinal
   T(GI) in offensive and defensive linemen.
   Design: Cross-sectional observational study.
   Setting: Division I Intercollegiate Athletics Football Program.
   Interventions: T(GI) was monitored during consecutive preseason
   sessions.
   Main Outcome Measurements: T(GI), heat illness, weight changes,
   environmental stress, and subjective symptoms.
   Results: Mean T(GI) were 37.8 degrees C and 38.3 degrees C during a.m.
   and p.m. practices, respectively. The a.m. practices revealed higher
   T(GI) gain (1.8 degrees C) compared to p.m. (1.4 degrees C). The p.m.
   practices had higher maximum T(GI) than a.m. practices (39.1 degrees C
   versus 38.8, P = 0.0001). Mean time to maximum temperature (T(max)) was
   1 hr and 30 min for a.m. and 1 hr and 22 min for p.m. practices.
   Offensive linemen trended toward higher mean T(GI) than defensive
   players (38.0 degrees C vs. 36.7 degrees C, P = 0.069). The rate of rise
   in T(GI) was significantly greater in a.m. practices. A decrease in rate
   of T(GI) rise was seen from the first to last a.m. practices of the week
   (P = 0.004).
   Conclusion: Significant T(GI) elevations in asymptomatic athletes are
   common in extreme heat during football practice. Intense a.m. practices
   in full gear result in higher net temperature gain and rate of
   temperature gain than p.m. practices. Offensive linemen trended toward
   higher T(GI) than defensive linemen. As players acclimatized, a decrease
   in the rate of T(GI) increase was appreciable, particularly in a.m.
   practices. Appreciating cumulative heat stress and variations in heal
   stress related to scheduling of practice is critical.},

Title = {Interannual Variability and Trends of Sea Surface Temperature Around
   Southern South America},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {The interannual variability and trends of sea surface temperature (SST)
   around southern South America are studied from 1982 to 2017 using
   monthly values of the Optimally Interpolation SST version 2 gridded
   database. Mid-latitude (30 degrees-50 degrees S) regions in the eastern
   South Pacific and western South Atlantic present moderate to intense
   warming (\~{}0.4 degrees C decade(-1)), while south of 50 degrees S the
   region around southern South America presents moderate cooling (\~{}
   -0.3 degrees C decade(-1)). Two areas of statistically significant
   trends of SST anomalies (SSTa) with opposite sign are found on the
   Patagonian Shelf over the southwest South Atlantic: a warming area
   delimited between 42 and 45 degrees S (Northern Patagonian Shelf; NPS),
   and a cooling area between 49 and 52 degrees S (Southern Patagonian
   Shelf; SPS). Between 1982 and 2017 the warming rate has been 0.15 +/-
   0.01 degrees C decade(-1) representing an increase of 0.52 degrees C at
   NPS, and the cooling rate has been -0.12 +/- 0.01 degrees C decade(-1)
   representing a decrease of 0.42 degrees C at SPS. On both regions, the
   largest trends are observed during 2008-2017 (0.35 +/- 0.02 degrees C
   decade(-1) at NPS and -0.27 +/- 0.03 degrees C decade(-1) at SPS), while
   the trends in 1982-2007 are non-significant, indicating the
   record-length SSTa trends are mostly associated with the variability
   observed during the past 10 years of the record. The spectra of the
   records present significant variance at interannual time scales,
   centered at about 80 months (\~{}6 years). The observed variability of
   SSTa is studied in connection with atmospheric forcing (zonal and
   meridional wind components, wind speed, wind stress curl and surface
   heat fluxes). During 1982-2007, the local meridional wind explains
   25-30\% of the total variance at NPS and SPS on interannual time scales.
   During 2008-2017, the SSTa at NPS is significantly anticorrelated with
   the local zonal wind (r = -0.85), while at SPS it is significantly
   anticorrelated with the meridional wind (r = -0.61). Our results show
   that a substantial fraction of the interannual variability of SSTa
   around southern South America can be described by the first three
   empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes which explain 28, 16, and 12\%
   of the variance, respectively. The variability of the three EOF
   principal components time series is associated with the combined
   variability of El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Interdecadal Pacific
   Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Appreciable advancement of low-temperature combustion processing brings
   a step closer to the fulfillment of large-area, flexible electronics.
   The maximum temperature of deposition is successfully reduced below the
   softening temperature of the polymeric substrates. The method embodies
   the incorporation of fuel- and oxidizer-ligands in the precursor, which
   leads to an exothermic reaction resulting in low-temperature conversion
   and/or densification of the metal oxide thin films. A series of
   electrically conducting, semiconducting, and high permittivity
   dielectric metal oxides are deposited on varied substrates, including
   flexible plastic substrates, such as polyimide and aromatic polyester.
   The combustion processing is efficient in depositing metal, metal oxide,
   metal-metal oxide composite thin films at considerably low temperatures.
   In addition, the combustible precursors are considered compatible with
   diverse solution deposition methods such as spin coating, spray coating,
   inkjet printing, and blade coating. The combustion processed metal oxide
   thin films have the potential to exhibit acceptable device performance
   of thin film transistors, solar cells, gas sensors, organic light
   emitting diodes, and so on. The present review not only covers the
   on-going research in solution combustion-based deposition, but also
   discusses potential of the various devices with combustion-derived thin
   films of functional oxides as active/passive components.},

Abstract = {The systematic bias of the estimated average temperature using daily
   T-max and T-min records relative to the standard average temperature of
   four time-equidistant observations and its effect on the estimated trend
   of long-term temperature change have not been well understood. This
   paper attempts to evaluate the systematic bias across mainland China
   using the daily data of national observational stations. The results
   revealed that the positive bias of annual mean temperature was large,
   reaching 0.58 degrees C nationally on average; regional average bias was
   lowest in the northwest arid region and highest in the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau; the bias was low in spring and summer and high in autumn and
   winter, reaching its lowest point in mid- and late May and highest point
   in early November. Furthermore, the bias showed a significant upward
   trend in the past 50 years, with a rising rate of 0.021 degrees C (10
   yr)(-1), accounting for about 12\% of the overall warming as estimated
   from the data of the observational network; the largest positive trend
   bias was found in the northwest arid region, while the east monsoon
   region experienced the smallest change; the most remarkable increase of
   the bias occurred after early 1990s. These results indicate that the
   customarily applied method to calculate daily and monthly mean
   temperature using T-max and T-min significantly overestimates the
   climatological mean and the long-term trend of surface air temperature
   in mainland China.},

Abstract = {The trend extraction of the burning zone temperature is the basis for
   the burning state identification and stability control of the cement. In
   this paper, the trend extraction method of the burning zone temperature
   based on singular spectrum analysis is studied. Firstly, a visual
   inspection device is used to detect the temperature of the burning zone.
   Then, the singular spectrum analysis is carried out to obtain the
   singular spectrum eigenvalue of the temperature. After that, the
   appropriate contribution rate of the singular spectrum eigenvalue is
   selected, and the signal is reconstructed to extract the trend of the
   temperature signal. At last, the trend extraction method is validated on
   some burning zone temperature data, which are obtained from a cement
   company. The result shows that this paper provides a feasible method for
   extracting the trend of the burning zone temperature.},

Abstract = {The annual and seasonal trends of surface air temperatures were analyzed
   on the territory of Vojvodina, north Serbia, using observed data from 10
   meteorological stations during 1949-2006. Of the 15 analyzed time series
   statistically significant positive trends were found in only 2 series.
   In the remaining 13 series were found trends with reduced statistical
   confidence. In general, the behavior of temperature could be considered
   rather non-changeable, than changeable. Quasi-changeable temperatures
   from 1949 to 2006 are surprisingly similar to the last glacial July
   paleo-temperatures. It seems that Vojvodina is a territory with more
   stable climate parameters than other regions.},

Abstract = {Europe has been warming over the past 30 years. In particular all
   seasonal temperature records have been broken since 2003, which altered
   socio-economic and environmental systems. Since we expect this trend in
   both mean and extreme temperatures to continue along the twenty first
   century under enhanced radiative forcing, it is crucial to understand
   the underlying mechanisms of such climate variations to help in
   considering adaptation or mitigation strategies to reduce the impacts of
   a warmer climate. From a statistical analysis we show that the
   inter-annual variability of European seasonal temperatures can be
   reconstructed from North-Atlantic atmospheric circulation only, but not
   their recent trends and extreme seasons. Adding North-Atlantic
   sea-surface temperature (SST) as a predictor helps improving the
   reconstruction, especially in autumn and winter. Sensitivity experiments
   with the MM5 regional model over 2003-2007 suggest that the anomalous
   SST enhance European land temperatures through the upper-air advection
   of heat and water vapor, interacting with radiative fluxes over the
   continent. This mechanism is pronounced in autumn and winter, where
   estimates of SST influence as obtained from MM5 are in agreement with
   those obtained from statistical regressions. We find a lesser SST
   influence in spring and summer, where local surface and radiative
   feedbacks are the main amplifiers of recent extremes.},

Abstract = {Mesospheric and stratospheric temperatures and winds from several
   stations in Germany are analyzed for long-term trends in 1988-2008.
   Emphasis is on upper mesosphere (87 km) hydroxyl (OH) temperatures at
   Wuppertal (51 degrees N, 7 degrees E) that agree favorably with
   satellite-borne observations from Sounding of the Atmosphere Using
   Broadband Emission Radiometry and a twin OH instrument at
   Hohenpeissenberg (48 degrees N, 11 degrees E) that is operational since
   2003. The two twin stations yield a combined data set with 80\% time
   coverage suitable for high time resolution analyses. Annual mean
   temperatures at Wuppertal show a long-term trend of -0.23 K/yr and a
   solar flux sensitivity of 0.035 K/solar flux unit. Trend analysis of
   monthly mean temperatures yields substantial variations from one month
   to another, between 0 and -0.6 K/yr, hence questioning the value of
   seasonal mean trends. The OH temperatures have a well-known
   characteristic form of seasonal variation. This form changes during the
   21 years of observation. The changes are compared to modifications of
   the summer length in the stratosphere and are interpreted as
   dynamics/circulation changes extending to the uppermost parts of the
   middle atmosphere.},

Abstract = {The pattern of Odonata species-richness in Britain is mapped at 10 km

   relationship with seasonal and monthly mean temperatures is explored:
   summer temperatures are better predictors of overall dragonfly richness
   than are winter temperatures. However, there appears to be some latitude
   variation in the relationship. Thus, in northern Britain, increasing
   Odonata richness is correlated with increasing summer temperatures for
   non-boreal species, and with decreasing winter temperatures for
   predominantly-boreal species; physiological adaptations of individual
   species are proposed as a possible explanation.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on sea surface temperature (SST) trends due to the
   importance of temperature difference in climate change impact research.
   These trends are not only essential for climate, but they are also
   important for marine ecosystem. Immigration of fish population due to
   the temperature changes is expected to cause unexpected economical
   results. For this purpose, both classical Mann-Kendall, (MK) (Mann in
   Econom: J Econom Soc 13:245-259, 1945; Kendall in Rank Correlation
   Methods, Charless Griffin, London, 1975) and innovative trend analysis
   (ITA) (Sen in J Hydrol Eng 17(9):1042-1046, 2012) methodologies are
   applied for the SST data records. Monthly SST data are considered along
   the Black, Marmara, Aegean, and Mediterranean coastal areas in Turkey.
   SST data are categorized into five clusters considering fish life as
   ``hot,{''} ``warm-hot,{''} ``warm,{''} ``cold,{''} and ``very cold.{''}
   According to ITA, SST in all coastal areas tends to increase except for
   winter season during ``very cold{''} (0-10 degrees C) temperatures. The
   temperature changes in both winter and summer seasons are expected to
   change the marine life, fish population, tourism habit, precipitation
   regime, and drought feature.},

Abstract = {Urban heat island is one of the most important consequences of climate
   change in cities. Various factors accelerate temperature increase in
   urban surfaces. Widespread use of impermeable materials with high heat
   capacity; albedo and trapping of incoming solar radiation in urban
   structure which prevents reflection; reduction in cooling at night due
   to increased building heights; and changes in the complex urban geometry
   are among these factors. The aim of this study is to investigate the
   surface temperature of Tehran in a 30-year period (1984-2014). The
   required images and land surface temperature maps were prepared using a
   split-window algorithm on thermal bands of landsat images for four
   periods. All images had been taken at 11:00-14:00 in summer. Temperature
   factors were calculated for different neighborhoods, and two patterns
   were obtained. One pattern showed the formation of urban heat island in
   barren lands, large workshop areas, and areas with military land use,
   and the other one showed the formation of urban heat island in dense
   building population areas with limited green space. The results indicate
   an increase in the area of the regions with a higher temperature in the
   city. In 1984, the smallest area belonged to the above 48 degrees C
   temperature category (1.8 ha), while in 2014 the below 25 degrees C
   category had the smallest area (0 ha). It was observed that the area of
   the former category reached over 1740 ha in 2014. Neighborhood
   temperature factors show that 17 Shahrivar and Khajeh Nasir-Hoghoughi
   neighborhoods are the hottest neighborhoods in Tehran. The findings in
   this study may persuade urban managers scientifically to make
   preparations for changing the life style focusing on urban macro-scale
   planning which is a widely emerging issue resulted from recent effects
   on Tehran's climate resilience. Considering the importance of urban
   planning priorities in urban ecosystem services, it is essential to make
   use of all urban elements and fill the empty gap between urban ecosystem
   services production and their consumption in the city by wise and smart
   urban management.},

Abstract = {Ground-based GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) has efficiently
   been used since the 1990s as a meteorological observing system. Recently
   scientists have used GNSS time series of precipitable water vapor (PWV)
   for climate research. In this work, we compare the temporal trends
   estimated from GNSS time series with those estimated from European
   Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis
   (ERA-Interim) data and meteorological measurements. We aim to evaluate
   climate evolution in Germany by monitoring different atmospheric
   variables such as temperature and PWV. PWV time series were obtained by
   three methods: (1) estimated from ground-based GNSS observations using
   the method of precise point positioning, (2) inferred from ERA-Interim
   reanalysis data, and (3) determined based on daily in situ measurements
   of temperature and relative humidity. The other relevant atmospheric
   parameters are available from surface measurements of meteorological
   stations or derived from ERA-Interim. The trends are estimated using two
   methods: the first applies least squares to deseasonalized time series
   and the second uses the Theil-Sen estimator. The trends estimated at 113
   GNSS sites, with 10 to 19 years temporal coverage, vary between -1.5 and
   2.3 mm decade(-1) with standard deviations below 0.25 mm decade(-1).
   These results were validated by estimating the trends from ERA-Interim
   data over the same time windows, which show similar values. These values
   of the trend depend on the length and the variations of the time series.
   Therefore, to give a mean value of the PWV trend over Germany, we
   estimated the trends using ERA-Interim spanning from 1991 to 2016 (26
   years) at 227 synoptic stations over Germany. The ERA-Interim data show
   positive PWV trends of 0.33 +/- 0.06 mm decade(-1) with standard errors
   below 0.03 mm decade(-1). The increment in PWV varies between 4.5 and
   6.5\% per degree Celsius rise in temperature, which is comparable to the
   theoretical rate of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.},

Abstract = {Recently, Karl et al. analysed monthly mean maximum and minimum
   temperatures from countries comprising 37\% of the global landmass. Over
   the period 1951-1990, minimum temperatures warmed by 0.84 degrees C
   compared to only 0.28 degrees C for maximum temperatures. Over the same
   period average temperatures, estimated for all the world's land areas,
   warmed by 0.33 degrees C, compared to 0.56 degrees C from those analysed
   by Karl et al. The difference is primarily due to the lack of tropical
   countries in the earlier analysis.
   In this paper results are presented for five countries not analysed
   earlier: Bangladesh, Ireland, Italy, Thailand and Turkey. Trends toward
   smaller diurnal ranges are present, though to lesser extents than in
   Karl et al. (1993).},

Abstract = {This study completes a line of research on the thermal evolution of the
   Spanish Mediterranean region started in the National Climate Plan
   (1999). A line that has tried to evaluate the magnitude of the climatic
   warming registered in the Spanish Mediterranean region. In the present
   work, a rigorous review of the conclusions previously reached (Quereda
   et al., 2000, 2016, 2020) on the magnitude and nature of the climatic
   warming recorded in the region has been made. The review is based on
   three axes. The first is the updating of the regional historical
   temperature series between 1950 and 2020. The results of this analysis
   have been compared with those obtained in a complementary manner in two
   new lines of research. The first of which was an experimental plan aimed
   at comparing the thermal evolution of the urban observatory of Castellon
   (Casino Antiguo) with the temperature data registered in nearby
   observatories located in areas less affected by human activity. The
   results of this plan, relative to the 2001-2020 period, have shown the
   existence of the thermal effect of urbanization (UHI) as well as its
   magnitude. The second investigation consisted in the analysis of the
   thermal evolution recorded in the Columbretes Islands observatory (28
   miles off the coast of Castellon). This insular climate series, thus
   analysed for the first time, has involved a review of the conclusions
   and trends established in our previous studies. Although the values
   obtained make it necessary to review the magnitude of the UHI, they have
   shown great consistency with the magnitude of climate warming obtained
   in the central analysis of the 22 complete regional thermal series. A
   real climate warming is shown with a secular value of 1.4 to 1.6 degrees
   C.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric or air temperature trend is generally adopted to understand
   the climate change of a locations/site but this parameter does not
   provide the actual feel-like experience. Apparent temperature on the
   other hand, which is based on wind speed, humidity and air temperature,
   provides a more precise information about the weather condition at a
   location which is very important for studies involving combination of
   these parameters. In this study, the annual and seasonal trends of air
   temperature have been compared with apparent temperature. The
   non-parameteric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator techniques
   were deployed to perform the analysis. It is observed that the trend of
   apparent temperature is same as that of the air temperature only during
   winter and summer seasons. During the monsoon and post-monsoon season,
   apart from Chennai station, other stations' trend behavior is same for
   apparent and air temperature. Annually, all the stations show an
   escalating trend in apparent temperature compared to air temperature
   where only Chennai, Madurai and Nagercoil showed an escalating trend.
   Since the apparent temperature is dependent on vapour pressure and wind
   speed, trend analysis has been carried out for these parameters also.
   For air temperature, stations Madurai and Nagercoil stations show
   significantly escalating trend, while Chennai shows an insignificantly
   escalating trend annually. During post-monsoon, all the stations show an
   escalating trend for air temperature. In case of relative humidity, none
   of the stations show any trend either in the winter season or annually.
   Similarly, no trend was observed for all the seasons as far as pressure
   is concerned at any of the stations. Only Ooty station shows a declining
   trend in wind speed annually; and during the monsoon Chennai has a
   significantly declining trend, while Ooty has an insignificantly
   declining trend.},

Abstract = {In the present study, the temperature data of 125 stations (1941 to
   2012) over parts of India have been analysed to evaluate trends and
   homogeneity using various statistical tests. The annual average,
   maximum, and minimum temperature data showed a positive trend of 0.44
   degrees C/100 years, 0.51 degrees C/100 years, and 0.19 degrees C/100
   years, respectively. All the seasonal temperature variables exhibited a
   positive trend with exception of the minimum temperature of the monsoon
   season which showed the negative trend at the rate of 0.05 degrees C/100
   years. The maximum temperature of monsoon season depicted a maximum
   increase at the rate of 0.80 degrees C/100 years. The results indicated
   that the process of urbanisation impacted over the change in
   temperatures. The homogeneity analysis showed the break years at 1972,
   1974, and 1977 for annual average, maximum, and minimum temperatures,
   respectively, for entire India. The seasonal analysis exhibited that the
   minimum temperatures of both winter and monsoon seasons and the maximum
   temperature of the post-monsoon season were homogeneous in nature. The
   rate of change in magnitude for all annual and seasonal temperature
   variables showed a considerable increase after the break years.},

Abstract = {Temperature trends derived from historical radiosonde data often show
   substantial differences compared to satellite measurements. These
   differences are especially large for stratospheric levels, and for data
   in the Tropics, where results are based on relatively few stations.
   Detailed comparisons of one radiosonde dataset with collocated satellite
   measurements from the Microwave Sounding Unit reveal time series
   differences that occur as step functions or jumps at many stations.
   These jumps occur at different times for different stations, suggesting
   that the differences are primarily related to problems in the radiosonde
   data, rather than in the satellite record. As a result of these jumps,
   the radiosondes exhibit systematic cooling biases relative to the
   satellites. A large number of the radiosonde stations in the Tropics are
   influenced by these biases, suggesting that cooling in the tropical
   lower stratosphere is substantially overestimated in these radiosonde
   data. Comparison of trends from stations with larger and smaller biases
   suggests the cooling bias extends into the tropical upper troposphere.
   Significant biases are observed in both daytime and nighttime radiosonde
   measurements.},

   analysis reported until about early 2002 were included. Since then not
   much new information on the temperature trends has been added.
   Nevertheless, some new results along with some modified results by
   revisiting the older data sets have been reported in recent time. Our
   understanding on the nature of temperature trends in the MLT region is
   relatively better understood now and model agreements with some of the
   specific observed feature are better reproduced in recent time. This
   paper briefly summarizes the progress made over the recent past in the
   field of mesopause region temperature trends and provide an update to
   Beig et al. (2003). Some new information is also added in recent time on
   the seasonal trend variability in temperature of the mesopause region
   which is also discussed in this article. Finally the new insight into
   the probable mechanisms to understand the observed trends along with
   future scope of the work in this field is outlined. (C) 2006 Elsevier

Title = {Forecasting Maximum Temperature Trends with SARIMAX: A Case Study from
   Ahmedabad, India},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Globalization and industrialization have significantly disturbed the
   environmental ecosystem, leading to critical challenges such as global
   warming, extreme weather events, and water scarcity. Forecasting
   temperature trends is crucial for enhancing the resilience and quality
   of life in smart sustainable cities, enabling informed decision-making
   and proactive urban planning. This research specifically targeted
   Ahmedabad city in India and employed the seasonal autoregressive
   integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX) model to
   forecast temperatures over a ten-year horizon using two decades of
   real-time temperature data. The stationarity of the dataset was
   confirmed using an augmented Dickey-Fuller test, and the Akaike
   information criterion (AIC) method helped identify the optimal seasonal
   parameters of the model, ensuring a balance between fidelity and
   prediction accuracy. The model achieved an RMSE of 1.0265, indicating a
   high accuracy within the typical range for urban temperature
   forecasting. This robust measure of error underscores the model's
   precision in predicting temperature deviations, which is particularly
   relevant for urban planning and environmental management. The findings
   provide city planners and policymakers with valuable insights and tools
   for preempting adverse environmental impacts, marking a significant step
   towards operational efficiency and enhanced governance in future smart
   urban ecosystems. Future work may extend the model's applicability to
   broader geographical areas and incorporate additional environmental
   variables to refine predictive accuracy further.},

Abstract = {In recent years, it has been observed that numerous cases of windstorm
   event. There are many factors that cause windstorms to occur. The
   factors of meteorology, urban morphology, the topography need to be
   studied to find out the cause of windstorms. The work analyzed
   meteorology factors such as: wind speed, humidity and temperature,
   occurring in 2017. Meteorological data from the Department of
   Environment Malaysia (DOE) station, allow determining the wind speed,
   humidity and temperature data daily in 2017. As well as, the pattern of
   parameter and their relationship between them being determined. The
   pattern of wind speed monthly was inconsistent. The highest average wind
   speed in 2017 was 4.72 m/s and the lowest average was 0.56 m/s. While
   humidity, the highest average was 83.12 \% and the lowest average
   humidity was 72.33 \%. For temperature, the maximum average for 2017 was
   28.43 degrees C and the minimum average was 26.26 degrees C. The
   correlation of wind speed between humidity and temperature was -0.256
   and 0.278, which is low correlate. That must be other active factors
   that influence the wind speed and contribute to the windstorm event.
   Wind speed, humidity and temperature during the windstorm event on 11
   February 2017 was analyzed. During the windstorm event, the wind speed
   blows up to 15.7 m/s while the humidity reading decrease to 68.4 \% and
   the temperature was 30.9 degrees C. When the wind speed reading is high,
   the temperature reading also increases and the humidity reading will go
   down and vice versa and has caused the windstorm event to happen.},

Abstract = {Retrievals of tropospheric temperature trends from data of the Microwave
   Sounding Unit (MSU) are subject to biases related to the strong cooling
   of the stratosphere during the past few decades. The magnitude of this
   stratospheric contamination in various retrievals is estimated using
   stratospheric temperature trend profiles based on observations. It is
   found that from 1979 to 2001 the stratospheric contribution to the trend
   of MSU channel-2 brightness temperature is about -0.08 K decade(-1),
   which is consistent with the findings of Fu et al. In the retrieval
   method developed by Fu et al. based on a linear combination of MSU
   channels 2 and 4, the stratospheric influence is largely removed,
   leaving a residual influence of less than +/-0.01 K decade(-1). This
   method is also found to be more accurate than the angular scanning
   retrieval technique of Spencer and Christy to remove the stratospheric
   contamination.},

Title = {What Causes the Arabian Gulf Significant Summer Sea Surface Temperature
   Warming Trend?},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The present study investigated the significant sea surface temperature
   (SST) warming trend during the summer season over the Arabian Gulf (AG)
   and its links with the large-scale atmospheric driver, namely, the
   Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), from 1900 to 2021. The link
   between the AMO and the AGs oceanic circulations has received little
   scientific attention. It has been found that there is a significant
   spatial positive trend, with a maximum of up to 0.6 degrees C per decade
   over the far northern end, while the time series trend shows a
   significant shift after 1995, with an average value of about 0.36
   degrees C per decade. The spatial trend in the AG is eight times and
   four times higher than the global value from 1980 to 2005 using HadISST
   and OISST, respectively. The AMOs significant role in the AGs SST
   significant warming trend has been confirmed by the spatial and temporal
   correlation coefficient, which is above 0.50 and 0.48, respectively,
   with statistical significance at the 99\% level. The underlying
   mechanisms that explained the AMO-related AGs SST decadal variability
   can be explained as follows: when the AMO is in a positive phase, the
   surface northwesterly wind weakens, leading to (1) less advection of the
   relatively cold air masses from Southern Europe to the AG and
   surrounding areas, (2) less evaporation, and thus less surface cooling
   (3); thus, this enhances the water masses stratification and decreases
   the upwelling process, and vice versa occurs for the negative phase. For
   the air temperature, the positive AMO phase coincides with the
   occurrence of warm air masses covering all of the Arabian Peninsula,
   North Africa, and Southern Europe. These processes prove that the AMO is
   a possible candidate for the AGs SST decadal variability, hence enabling
   a better evaluation of future climate scenarios for this important
   region. Our results provide initial insights into the AMO-driven
   spatiotemporal variability in the SST over the AG and prove that the
   relation is nonstationary over time. Further analyses are required to
   explore whether the impacts of the AMO are extended to other oceanic
   variables such as evaporation rate, heat transport, etc.},

Title = {Introducing long-term trends into subseasonal temperature forecasts
   through trend-aware postprocessing},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Skilful subseasonal forecasts are crucial for issuing early warnings of
   extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods. Operational
   subseasonal climate forecasts are often produced by global climate
   models not dissimilar to seasonal forecast models, which typically fail
   to reproduce observed temperature trends. In this study, we identify
   that the same issue exists in the subseasonal forecasting system.
   Subsequently, we adapt a trend-aware forecast postprocessing method,
   previously developed for seasonal forecasts, to calibrate and correct
   the trend in subseasonal forecasts. We modify the method to embed
   30-year climate trends into the calibrated forecasts even when the
   available hindcast period is shorter. The use of 30-year trends is to
   robustly represent long-term climate changes and overcome the problem
   that trends inferred from a shorter period may be subject to large
   sampling variability. Calibration is applied to 20-year ECMWF
   subseasonal forecasts and AWAP observations of Australian minimum and
   maximum temperatures with forecast horizons of up to 4 weeks. Relative
   to day-of-year climatology, raw week-1 forecasts reproduce temperature
   trends of the 20-year observations in many regions while raw week-4
   forecasts do not exhibit the 20-year observed trends. After trend-aware
   postprocessing, the behaviour of forecast trends is related to raw
   forecast skill regarding accuracy. Calibrated week-1 forecasts show
   apparent trends consistent with the 20-year observations, as the
   calibration transfers forecast skill and embeds the 20-year observed
   trends into the forecasts when raw forecasts are inherently skilful. In
   contrast, calibrated week-4 forecasts exhibit the 30-year observed
   trends, as the calibration reverts the forecasts to the 30-year observed
   climatology with trends when raw forecasts have little skill. For both
   weeks, the trend-aware calibrated forecasts are more reliable, and as
   skilful as or more skilful than raw forecasts. The extended trend-aware
   method can be applied to deliver high-quality subseasonal forecasts and
   support decision-making in a changing climate.},

Abstract = {Maximum and minimum temperatures (T-max and T-min) are indicators of
   changes in climate. In this study, observed and gridded T-max and T-min
   data of Dehradun are analyzed for the period 1901-2014. Observed data
   obtained from India Meteorological Department and National Institute of
   Hydrology, whereas gridded data from Climatic Research Unit (CRU) were
   used. Efficacy of elevation-corrected CRU data was checked by cross
   validation using data of various stations at different elevations. In
   both the observed and gridded data, major change points were detected
   using Cumulative Sum chart. For T-max, change points occur in the years
   1974 and 1997, while, for T-min, in 1959 and 1986. Statistical
   significance of trends was tested in three sub-periods based on change
   points using Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Sen's slope estimator, and linear
   regression (LR) method. It has been found that both the T-max and T-min
   have a sequence of rising, falling, and rising trends in sub-periods.
   Out of three different methods used for trend tests, MK and SS have
   indicated similar results, while LR method has also shown similar
   results for most of the cases. Root-mean-square error for actual and
   anomaly time series of CRU data was found to be within one standard
   deviation of observed data which indicates that the CRU data are very
   close to the observed data. The trends exhibited by CRU data were also
   found to be similar to the observed data. Thus, CRU temperature data may
   be quite useful for various studies in the regions of scarcity of
   observational data.},

Title = {Abundance trend with condensation temperature for stars with different

Journal = {ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {592},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Context. During the past decade, several studies reported a correlation
   between chemical abundances of stars and condensation temperature (also
   known as T-c trend). However, the real astrophysical nature of this
   correlation is still debated.
   Aims. The main goal of this work is to explore the possible dependence
   of the T-c trend on stellar Galactocentric distances, R-mean.
   Methods. We used high-quality spectra of about 40 stars observed with
   the HARPS and UVES spectrographs to derive precise stellar parameters,
   chemical abundances, and stellar ages. A differential line-by-line
   analysis was applied to achieve the highest possible precision in the
   chemical abundances.
   Results. We confirm previous results that {[}X/Fe] abundance ratios
   depend on stellar age and that for a given age, some elements also show
   a dependence on R-mean. When using the whole sample of stars, we observe
   a weak hint that the T-c trend depends on R-mean. The observed
   dependence is very complex and disappears when only stars with similar
   ages are considered.
   Conclusions. To conclude on the possible dependence of the T-c trend on
   the formation place of stars, a larger sample of stars with very similar
   atmospheric parameters and stellar ages observed at different
   Galactocentric distances is needed.},

Abstract = {The variations of Iran temperature is studied during 1961-2010.
   Mann-Kendall tests show a general dominating positive temperature trend
   over most parts of Iran with the rate of change varying from 0.09 to
   0.38 degrees C decade(-1). Also, the minimum temperature increase (0.34
   degrees C decade(-1)) is greater than maximum temperature (0.15 degrees

Abstract = {By construction, the time series for radiative forcing that are used to
   run the 20c3m experiments, which are implemented by climate models,
   impart non-stationary movements (either stochastic or deterministic) to
   the simulated time series for global surface temperature. Here, we
   determine whether stochastic or deterministic trends are present in the
   simulated time series for global surface temperature by examining the
   time series for radiative forcing. Statistical tests indicate that the
   forcings contain a stochastic trend against the alternative hypothesis
   that the series are trend stationary with a one-time structural change.
   This result is consistent with the economic processes that impart a
   stochastic trend to anthropogenic emissions and the physical processes
   that integrate emissions in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the stochastic
   trend in the aggregate measure of radiative forcing also is present in
   the simulated time series for global surface temperature, which is
   consistent with the relation between these two variables that is
   represented by a zero dimensional energy balance model. Finally, we
   propose that internal weather variability imposed on the stochastic
   trend in radiative forcings is responsible for statistical results,
   which gives the impression that global surface temperature is trend
   stationary with a one-time structural change. We conclude that using the
   ideas of stochastic trends, cointegration, and error correction can
   generate reliable conclusions regarding the causes of changes in global
   surface temperature during the instrumental temperature record.},

Abstract = {This research analyzes the urban effect on annual and seasonal trends
   and the extreme temperature indices at Beijing Meteorological Station,
   using daily maximum and minimum temperature data of 6 meteorological
   stations from 1960 to 2008. The results show that the warm nights, warm
   days, mean maximum temperature and mean minimum frost days, cold days,
   cold nights and mean diurnal temperature Observatory during the time
   period, and these changes are significant temperature increase, the
   range decrease at Beijing statistically. The extreme temperature indices
   based on daily minimum temperature including frost days, cold nights,
   warm nights, mean minimum temperature and mean diurnal temperature range
   undergo more significant changes than those indices based on daily
   maximum temperature such as cold days, warm days and the mean maximum
   temperature. The effects of urbanization causes a significant decrease
   of frosts days (-5. 78 d/10a), cold nights (-17. 83 d/10a) and the
   average daily temperature range or DTR (-0. 73 degrees C/10a), and a
   significant increase of warm nights (14. 76 d/10a) and the average
   minimum temperature (0. 70 degrees C/10a) in Beijing Station. Urban
   effects on the trends of the indices series of Beijing Station relative
   to daily minimum temperature are significant at the 0. 01 confidence
   level, and the contributions of the urban effect to the overall changes
   of the annual mean extreme indices series all reach 100\%, indicating
   that the changes observed are overwhelmingly caused by the urban effect.
   Due to the urban effect, cold nights and DTR significantly decrease, and
   warm nights and mean minimum temperature significantly increase for all
   seasons (significant at the 0. 01 confidence level). The urban effects
   on trends of the indices series of mean minimum temperature and mean DTR
   are the largest in wintertime, and the urban effects on trends of the
   indices series of warm nights are mainly in summertime. It is essential
   to pay more attention to the urban effects on extreme temperature
   indices trends of China meteorological stations near big cities like
   Beijing.},

Abstract = {The electrical performance as a function of operating temperature of

   (TFTs) is assessed by measuring drain current versus gate voltage
   {[}log(I-D)-V-GS] transfer curves at temperatures from -50 degrees C to

   using thermal silicon dioxide as the gate insulator. An almost rigid
   log(I-D)-V-GS transfer curve shift to lower (more negative) turn-on
   voltage (V-ON) with increasing temperature is observed. The extent of
   the V-ON operating temperature dependence of a TFT appears to be
   correlated to its trap density. A lower trap density gives rise to less
   V-ON operating temperature dependence. Although log(I-D)-V-GS transfer
   curves are observed to shift almost rigidly with temperature, a more
   detailed temperature-dependence assessment indicates that the shift is
   not exactly rigid. The mobility is found to increase slightly with
   increasing operating temperature. This trend is attributed to enhanced
   detrapping at a higher operating temperature.},

Title = {Trends of ocean temperature influencing snow crab catch along the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},

Volume = {200},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The snow crab ( Chionoecetes opilio ) fishery has great economic
   importance for Nova Scotia, contributing \$263 million to fisheries and
   more than one-fifth of Canadian snow crab revenues in 2021. Being a
   stenothermic species, snow crabs can only live within a narrow range of
   temperatures between-1 to 6 degrees C. The Scotian Shelf holds the
   southernmost populations of snow crab in the Atlantic and snow crab
   catch-per-unit-area (CPUA) in the Scotian Shelf. Trawl survey data from
   Ocean, because these cold-temperature requirements are a limiting factor
   for its distribution. This study investigates the relationship between
   bottom ocean temperature Fisheries and Oceans Canada from 2012 to 2021
   were used. Through nonlinear modelling, CPUA (mt/km 2 ) was regressed
   with respect to bottom ocean temperature along Northwest Atlantic
   Fisheries Organization divisions N-ENS, CFA 23, CFA 24, and CFA. The
   temperature-vs-CPUA relationship was unimodal for all studied years. The
   best-fit models explained a limited amount of variation, but CPUA
   consistently decreased to zero towards the highest recorded
   temperatures. Due to the ongoing global warming, bottom ocean
   temperatures across the Scotian Shelf will likely continue to increase,
   which thus might harm the Scotian Shelf snow crab fishery. In
   conclusion, this study underscores the potential impact of global
   warming on the economically significant snow crab fishery in the Scotian
   Shelf. The findings serve as a critical alert to the possible
   consequences of rising ocean temperatures, thereby contributing to our
   understanding and preparation for the future of marine ecosystems and
   industries.},

Abstract = {Temperature has a control on growth, development and yield of crops.
   Extreme high and low temperatures can be a limiting factor on crops.
   Extreme temperatures have accompanied global average temperature
   increase. Investigating the changes in indices derived using daily
   minimum and maximum temperatures may provide information about how
   extreme temperatures related to crop production have changed under
   global warming. In this sense, it is aimed in this study to investigate
   the climatology and monotonic temporal trends of a number of
   temperature-based agroclimatic indices across western Anatolia, Turkiye.
   The indices included number of frost days (NFD), first fall/winter frost
   (FFF), last winter/spring frost (LSF), frost period (FP), accumulated
   frost (AF), plant heat stress day (PHSD), plant heat stress accumulation
   (PHSA), growing season start (GSS), growing season end (GSE), growing
   season length (GSL) and growing degree-day (GDD). Significance of trends
   was assessed using Mann-Kendall test, and trend rates were quantified by
   Sen's slope estimator. The results firstly showed that southern
   low-elevation stations have the lowest frequency, intensity and duration
   of frost as a result of rarely occurring frost events. These stations
   are also characterized by the highest GDD, the earliest GSS, the latest
   GSE and hence the longest GSL, even with never-ending growing seasons in
   many years. They are also exposed to the highest heat stress in terms of
   frequency and intensity. On the other hand, northern high-elevation
   stations have completely opposite character for all indices in
   comparison to southern low-elevation stations. Trend analysis revealed
   that frequency of frost events had decreasing trends (i.e., decreased
   NFD), accompanied by later onset of FFF, earlier onset of LSF and hence
   shortened FP and decreased AF. As for growing season indices, in
   general, GSS occurred earlier, GSE occurred later and GSL extended.
   Growing degree-day and heat stress indices had substantial increasing
   trends, implying that, over the course of study period, the study area
   had more thermal accumulation and exposed to more heat stress that may
   hinder crop development.},

Abstract = {Design plays a key role in the interpretability of complex
   visualizations. Many applied domains utilize large quantities of data to
   make predictions, ranging from maps showing the spread of infectious
   disease to line graphs displaying global temperature changes. These
   visualizations tap into the visual system's ability to extract
   information from groups of similar objects, a process known as ensemble
   processing, and the cognitive system's ability to relate visual features
   such as color to meaningful concepts such as disease or temperature.
   Visualizations must consider both perceptual and cognitive abilities. It
   remains unclear which best improves comprehension: visualizations
   designed to exploit ensemble processes or that use semantically resonant
   colors that align with the underlying data. To address this question,
   participants were shown visualizations designed for ensemble processes
   in that they used color encodings with only a single hue or designed for
   semantic processes in that they prioritized color alignment with the
   meaning of the data. Participants viewed stripplots using these colors
   and judged whether the temperature depicted in the graphs was increasing
   or decreasing. As quantified using the signal detection measure d',
   participants' sensitivity to trend information was higher with the
   single-hue palettes than with more semantically expressive multihue
   palettes. Our results suggest that visualizations may convey trend
   information more effectively by selecting colors that exploit ensemble
   processes rather than selecting semantically compatible colors.
   Moreover, our results showed semantic compatibility had no effect on
   sensitivity to trend direction.
   Public Significance Statement Understanding changes over time, such as
   stock and house market fluctuations or global temperatures, is important
   when making decisions related to the future. Typically, these changes
   are presented in time series graphs such as stripplots which, in the
   context of temperature data, use color choices that intuitively map onto
   temperature data with red corresponding to warming and blue
   corresponding to cooling. But how important is this kind of semantic
   compatibility? Our findings show that visualizations can communicate
   information more effectively to the public by selecting colors that
   exploit ensemble processes, a property of the visual system, rather than
   optimizing for semantic compatibility.},

Abstract = {Trends in seasonal mean values of maximum and minimum temperature are
   analysed in the Spanish mainland from the new MOTEDAS\_century database.
   This new data set has been developed combining the digitalized archives
   from the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) with information
   retrieved from Annual Books published by the former Meteorological
   Agency dating back to 1916, and covers the period 1916-2015. In all four
   seasons, mean seasonal temperature of maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin)
   increased. The raising occurred in two main pulses separated by a first
   pause around the middle of the 20th century, but differed among seasons
   and also between maximum and minimum temperature. Analysis of the
   percentage of land affected by significant trends in maximum temperature
   reveals two increasing phases in spring and summer for Tmax, and in
   spring, summer, and autumn for Tmin. However, winter Tmax only rose
   during the recent decades, and autumn Tmax in the first decades.
   Negative significant trends were found in extended areas in spring Tmax,
   and in spring, autumn, and summer Tmin, confirming the first pause
   around the 1940's-1960's. Trends of seasonal mean values of Tmax and
   Tmin are not significant for at least the last 25-35 years of the study
   period, depending on the season. The areas under significant positive
   trend are usually more extended for Tmin than Tmax at any season and
   period. Areas with significant trend expand and contract in time
   according to two spatial gradients: south-east to north-west (east-west)
   for Tmax, and west to east for Tmin. We hypothesize a relationship
   between atmospheric prevalent advection and relief as triggering factors
   to understand spatial and temporal differences in seasonal temperatures
   at regional scale during the 20th century in the Iberian Peninsula.},

Abstract = {In this study, the impacts of both temperature and wind speed trends on
   reference evapotranspiration have been assessed using as a case study
   the Southern Italy, which present a wide variety of combination of such
   climatic variables trends in terms of direction and magnitude. The
   existence of statistically significant trends in wind speed and
   temperature from observational datasets, measured in ten stations over
   Southern Italy during the period 1968-2004, has been investigated. Time
   series have been examined using the Mann-Kendall nonparametric
   statistical test in order to detect possible evidences of wind speed and
   temperature trends at different temporal resolution and significance
   level. Once trends have been examined and quantified, the effects of
   these trends on seasonal reference evapotranspiration have been
   evaluated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation. Results quantified
   the effects of extrapolated temperature and wind speed trends on
   reference evapotranspiration. Where these climatic drivers are on the
   same direction, reference evapotranspiration generally increases during
   the growing season due to a nonlinear overlapping of effects. Whereas
   wind speed decreases and temperature increases, there is a sort of
   counterbalancing effect between the two considered climatic forcing in
   determining future reference evapotranspiration.},

Abstract = {Various biochemical and physiological variables are related to outcome
   in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, the prognostic implications of
   trends in body temperature (BT) in this population have not yet been
   studied. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between
   trends in BT and outcome in incident HD patients.
   Six thousand seven hundred and forty-two incident HD patients without
   thyroid disease from the Renal Research Institute were followed for 1
   year. Patients were divided into tertiles of initial pre-dialysis BT
   (Tertile 1: 36.47C, Tertile 2: 36.47 to 36.71C and Tertile 3: 36.7C) and
   further classified according to the change in BT (increased:
   0.01C/month, decreased: less than 0.01C/month and stable, with change
   between 0.01 and 0.01C/month) during the first year of treatment. The
   reference group is Tertile 2 of initial temperature with stable BT. Cox
   regression was used for survival analyses. Analyses were repeated for
   patients who survived the first year and were treated for epsilon 1
   month in Year 2.
   BT decreased in 2903 patients, remained stable in 2238 patients and
   increased in 1601 patients. After adjustment for multiple risk factors,
   hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were higher for those groups in whom,
   irrespective of the initial BT, BT increased or declined, as compared to
   the reference group during follow-up (HR between 1.46 and 2.27).
   The best survival was observed in the group with the highest BT at
   baseline and stable BT during the follow-up period (HR 0.50).},

Abstract = {Air temperature variability and trends in Romania were analysed using
   monthly, seasonal, and annual datasets. Temperature data of winter wheat
   season were also analysed. The Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimate,
   the sequential version of the Mann-Kendall test, the Pettitt test and
   spatial and temporal hierarchical cluster analyses were used. First, the
   datasets were checked for changing points. The 106-year period was
   divided into two long periods of 100 years each to verify the importance
   of a very short interval in changing of general trends; after that it
   was divided into three shorter periods of 35-36 years each. The main
   conclusions are as follows: the 6 years making up the difference between
   the two long periods are very important in the context of the recent
   global warming; the three shorter periods analysis indicate some
   fluctuations rather than continuous warming. The latest short period is
   the most relevant for global warming. Spatial hierarchical cluster
   analysis indicated the existence of two distinctive groups. One of them,
   which includes stations in the south-east part of the country, seems to
   be influenced by the Black Sea surface temperature. Temporal
   hierarchical cluster analysis reveals that annual data series have the
   closest relation with the summer data series. Further, the impact of
   temperature changes on winter wheat phenology was determined using a
   phenology simulation performed with the model from the Decision Support
   System for Agrotechnology Transfer v. 4.0.2.0 platform. Earlier
   occurrences of anthesis and maturity were noticed for several regions in
   the country.},

Abstract = {With the MODIS Aqua satellite-derived ocean chlorophyll concentration
   and sea surface temperature(SST) time series data, recent changing
   trends were evaluated by linear regression analysis. Furthermore, the
   time frequency space and regions in time frequency space where the
   chlorophyll and SST time series show high common power and phase angle
   were explored and found with Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and
   Cross wavelet transform(XWT) methods. Results showed that during
   2003-2009, the global ocean chlorophyll concentration is increasing
   while the SST is decreasing. There is a stable one year frequency in the
   global ocean chlorophyll for the whole time period but a half year
   frequency only in 2007-2009. To the SST, there are a stable one year and
   half year frequency during 2003-2009. There is a stable one and an
   unstable 0.5 year resonance frequency between global ocean chlorophyll
   and SST. The phase angle between global ocean chlorophyll and SST
   increased from 130 to 180 for one year resonance frequency and phase
   relationship changed from in-phase to anti-phase for 0.5 year frequency

Abstract = {New data acquisitions are used to examine recent global trends in
   maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and the diurnal temperature
   range (DTR). On average, the analysis covers the equivalent of 71\% of
   the total global land area, 17\% more than in previous studies.
   Consistent with the IPCC Third Assessment Report, minimum temperature
   increased more rapidly than maximum temperature (0.204 vs. 0.141 degrees
   C dec(-1)) from 1950 - 2004, resulting in a significant DTR decrease (-
   0.066 degrees C dec(-1)). In contrast, there were comparable increases
   in minimum and maximum temperature (0.295 vs. 0.287 degrees C dec(-1))
   from 1979 - 2004, muting recent DTR trends (- 0.001 degrees C dec(-1)).
   Minimum and maximum temperature increased in almost all parts of the
   globe during both periods, whereas a widespread decrease in the DTR was
   only evident from 1950 - 1980.},

Abstract = {State-space models were used to derive non-parametric sea surface
   temperature (SST) trends from 26 locations in and around the Gulf of
   Alaska for the period 1950-97. The SST trends reflect important
   large-scale climate impacts associated with El Nino events and regime
   shifts, but also reveal significant spatial heterogeneity across the
   region. The SST trends cluster into five distinct regions that define a
   robust zonal and meridional asymmetry. The meridional differences
   reflect the relative impact of El Nino events, while the zonal
   differences reflect variations it? the timing and amplitude of a
   region-wide post-1970 warming trend. The 1976 regime shift is evident
   primarily as an accelerated warming it? the northern and eastern
   portions of the Gulf of Alaska. The climate signals identified in the
   SST series are of sufficient magnitude and duration that they could
   potentially foster changes in lower trophic productivity and structure,
   which could lead to a broader ecosystem reorganization. Regional
   differences in Steller sea hot? population trends may have resulted from
   a spatially heterogeneous upper-ocean response to large-scale climate
   variability.},

Abstract = {We present a theoretical survey of ferromagnetic transition temperatures
   in cubic (III,Mn)V semiconductors based on a model with S=5/2 local
   moments exchange coupled to itinerant holes in the host semiconductor
   valence band. Starting from the simplest mean-field theory of this
   model, we estimate the T-c enhancement due to exchange and correlation
   in the itinerant-hole system and the T-c suppression due to collective
   fluctuations of the ordered moments. We show that high critical
   temperatures in these ferromagnetic semiconductors require both the
   large magnetic susceptibility contribution from the valence-band heavy
   holes and the large spin stiffness resulting from a complex valence-band
   structure that includes the more dispersive light holes. Our
   calculations demonstrate that the model of carrier-induced
   ferromagnetism of these systems is consistent with high critical
   temperatures observed experimentally in (III,Mn)V semiconductors.},

Title = {Broad Consistency Between Observed and Simulated Trends in Sea Surface
   Temperature Patterns},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {47},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Using seven single-model ensembles and the two multimodel ensembles
   CMIP5 and CMIP6, we show that observed and simulated trends in sea
   surface temperature (SST) patterns are globally consistent when
   accounting for internal variability. Some individual ensemble members
   simulate trends in large-scale SST patterns that closely resemble the
   observed ones. Observed regional trends that lie at the outer edge of
   the models' internal variability range allow two nonexclusive
   interpretations: (a) Observed trends are unusual realizations of the
   Earth's possible behavior and/or (b) the models are systematically
   biased but large internal variability leads to some good matches with
   the observations. The existing range of multidecadal SST trends is
   influenced more strongly by large internal variability than by
   differences in the model formulation or the observational data sets.
   Plain Language Summary Climate model simulations agree well with the
   observed evolution of the global mean sea surface temperature, but their
   ability to realistically represent changes in the patterns of sea
   surface temperatures has been questioned. We show with an unprecedented
   number of simulations from different models and different initial
   conditions that the observed and simulated changes in SST patterns are
   consistent in most regions of the ocean. For each model, a few
   individual simulations recreate the observed patterns. In some regions,
   the observed changes may be an extreme realization of the Earth's
   possible behavior. Alternatively, structural model errors may be hidden
   by the large range of possible realizations.},

Abstract = {In this paper, two datasets, a long time series (1951-2012) of daily
   surface observations at one meteorological station and a shorter time
   series (1979-2012) of three-hourly data with 0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees
   spatial resolution were analysed by using non-parametric methods to
   identify annual and seasonal variations in surface humidity and
   temperature. The results reveal that: (1) saturation water vapour
   pressure increased exponentially with temperature. Actual daily values
   at Beijing Meteorological Station are very close to the theoretical
   values estimated by using the simplified Clausius-Clapeyron equation,
   but with seasonal variations. (2) For both long- and short-term data,
   clear increasing tendencies of annual saturation specific humidity and
   temperature are found. Decreasing and drying trends were detected for
   winter. (3) The annual relative humidity showed a decreasing trend
   except for some suburban areas, somehow related to the lower temperature
   and increased specific humidity in those areas. (4) Regional changes in
   topography and elevation likely influenced trends in surface humidity,
   while local land use showed little effect on it.},

Abstract = {Much of the previous work on trends in temperature extremes has
   considered anomalies relative to a fixed base period climatology.
   Calculated in this way, trends toward more extreme warm events and less
   extreme cold events will be found if the mean temperature is warming. In
   this study we calculate anomalies relative to a 30-year running mean in
   order to examine trends in surface temperature variability and extremes
   separately from changes in the mean. The difference between trends
   calculated relative to a running mean and those calculated relative to a
   stationary mean will depend on the magnitude of the trend in the mean.
   Monthly trends in the positive, negative, and absolute values of daily
   minimum and maximum temperature anomalies at 158 stations across Canada
   are presented. The slopes of the trends and their significance are
   calculated using non-parametric methods. Trends are strongest in winter
   and early spring. Decreasing variability is found in the west and
   northeast, with the greater part of this reduction due to less intense
   cold anomalies. Regions of increased variability exist in the Prairies
   during winter and in the Atlantic Provinces in early spring. In general,
   the trends in variability are small compared to the mean temperature
   trends, implying that while the mean of the temperature distribution at
   Canadian sites is warming, the variance shows little change.},

Abstract = {This paper documents various unresolved issues in using surface
   temperature trends as a metric for assessing global and regional climate
   change. A series of examples ranging from errors caused by temperature
   measurements at a monitoring station to the undocumented biases in the
   regionally and globally averaged time series are provided. The issues
   are poorly understood or documented and relate to micrometeorological
   impacts due to warm bias in nighttime minimum temperatures, poor siting
   of the instrumentation, effect of winds as well as surface atmospheric
   water vapor content on temperature trends, the quantification of
   uncertainties in the homogenization of surface temperature data, and the
   influence of land use/land cover (LULC) change on surface temperature
   trends. Because of the issues presented in this paper related to the
   analysis of multidecadal surface temperature we recommend that greater,
   more complete documentation and quantification of these issues be
   required for all observation stations that are intended to be used in
   such assessments. This is necessary for confidence in the actual
   observations of surface temperature variability and long-term trends.},

Abstract = {Mean annual temperature trends in the tropical Andes were determined
   over the last six decades (1939-1998), to investigate the apparent
   inconsistency between the observed glacier retreat and the reported
   slight cooling trend in the lower tropical troposphere after 1979. Our
   results indicate that temperature in the tropical Andes has increased by
   0.10 degrees - 0.11 degreesC/decade since 1939. The rate of warming has
   more than tripled over the last 25 years (0.32 degrees- 0.34
   degreesC/decade) and the last two years of the series, associated with
   the 1997/98 El Nino, were the wannest of the last six decades.
   Temperature trends vary with altitude and show a generally reduced
   warming with increasing elevation. However, despite the lower rate of
   warming, the trend toward increased temperatures is still significant at
   the 95\% confidence level, even at the highest elevations. Clearly high
   elevation surface stations in the: Andes do not reflect the slight
   cooling trend observed in the tropical lower-troposphere.},

Title = {Short-period temperature variability at Winnipeg, Canada, 1872-1993:
   Characteristics and trends},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {147-159},
Abstract = {Temperature variability in Winnipeg, Canada, was assessed by determining
   average and extreme temperature ranges over 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15-day
   intervals, on a monthly basis, for the period of 1872-1993. Trends in
   the monthly averages for each of the intervals were also examined.
   The results show that Winnipeg experiences a very large amount of
   short-term temperature variability, especially over 2, 5, 10 and 15
   days. The monthly average diurnal ranges vary from about 9 to 14 degrees
   C , while the 15-day average ranges are about two to three times as
   large. In general, average temperature ranges over the two shortest
   intervals (1 and 2 days) are slightly greater in the warm-season months
   than in the cold-season months, but the averages for the three longest
   intervals are inversely related to mean monthly temperature, as are the
   largest ranges observed in each of the months.
   Average temperature variability in the months of November through March
   was found to have decreased quite significantly, and rapidly, during the
   first two decades of this century. This decrease was likely associated
   with a decrease in the meridionality of the atmospheric circulation. It
   also occurred during a time when the average maximum and minimum
   temperatures in Winnipeg were rising, lending support to the conjecture
   that a warmer global climate will result in less 1-15 day temperature
   variability. The rapidity of the change also supports the hypothesis
   that climate changes tend to be non-linear.},

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Las Vegas urban area expanded rapidly during the last two decades.
   In order to understand the impacts on the environment, it is imperative
   that the rate and type of urban expansion is determined. Remote sensing
   is an efficient and effective way to study spatial change in urban areas
   and Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) is a valuable technique to retrieve
   subpixel landcover information from remote sensing images. In this
   research, urban growth trends in Las Vegas are studied over the 1990 to
   2010 period using images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and
   National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP). The SMA model of TM pixels
   is calibrated using high resolution NAIP classified image. The trends of
   land cover change are related to the land surface temperature trends
   derived from TM thermal infrared images. The results show that the rate
   of change of various land covers followed a linear trend in Las Vegas.
   The largest increase occurred in residential buildings followed by roads
   and commercial buildings. Some increase in vegetation cover in the form
   of tree cover and open spaces (grass) is also seen and there is a
   gradual decrease in barren land and bladed ground. Trend analysis of
   temperature shows a reduction over the new development areas with
   increased vegetation cover especially, in the form of golf courses and
   parks. This research provides a useful insight about the role of
   vegetation in ameliorating temperature rise in arid urban areas.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH},

Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {434-446},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coastal sea surface temperature (SST), measured daily at the British
   Columbia (BC) Lighthouse network of stations, has been analyzed in this
   paper. A network of 14 of the 27 stations had (near) continuous data
   sets. These stations were clustered previously into exposed
   (northern/outer) and sheltered (southern/inner) sites. SST trends,
   evaluated between 1973 and 2010, show that the temperature contrast
   between these clusters is becoming greater: The northern/exposed
   stations are strongly influenced by interdecadal (Pacific Decadal
   oscillation {[}PDO]) and multidecadal oscillations in the north Pacific
   that are coherent with HadISST1.1 data for the region. There is no
   statistically significant warming trend for this region. The stations in
   the Strait of Georgia are much less influenced by the PDO and show a
   statistically significant mean increase in SST of up to 0.56 degrees
   C/decade (Anomaly 1). This is higher than the global average and
   contrasts markedly with the trends from the northern stations. The
   warming trends of the southern stations are significant at all months of
   the year but are most evident during summer (July-September). The
   summertime anomalies in temperature at Active Pass are significantly
   correlated (p < 0.001) with the temperature of the Fraser River water.
   Temperature differences between the Strait of Georgia and the outer
   shelf (Anomaly 2) are increasing in time; this is particularly evident
   since 2000. Monthly averaged MODIS satellite data (4x4-km resolution)
   show that trends in SST at two selected sites in the Strait of Georgia
   are very similar to the BC Lighthouse measurements and support the
   spatial extrapolation of the Lighthouse measurements. At present rates
   of SST rise, the southern coastal waters of BC will be about 3 degrees C
   warmer by the end of the 21st century.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the significance of trends of four temperature
   time series-Central England Temperature (CET), Stockholm,
   Faraday-Vernadsky, and Alert. First the robustness and accuracy of
   various trend detection methods are examined: ordinary least squares,
   robust and generalized linear model regression, Ensemble Empirical Mode
   Decomposition (EEMD), and wavelets. It is found in tests with surrogate
   data that these trend detection methods are robust for nonlinear trends,
   superposed autocorrelated fluctuations, and non-Gaussian fluctuations.
   An analysis of the four temperature time series reveals evidence of
   long-range dependence (LRD) and nonlinear warming trends. The
   significance of these trends is tested against climate noise. Three
   different methods are used to generate climate noise: (i) a
   short-range-dependent autoregressive process of first order {[}AR(1)],
   (ii) an LRD model, and (iii) phase scrambling. It is found that the
   ability to distinguish the observed warming trend from stochastic trends
   depends on the model representing the background climate variability.
   Strong evidence is found of a significant warming trend at
   Faraday-Vernadsky that cannot be explained by any of the three null
   models. The authors find moderate evidence of warming trends for the
   Stockholm and CET time series that are significant against AR(1) and
   phase scrambling but not the LRD model. This suggests that the degree of
   significance of climate trends depends on the null model used to
   represent intrinsic climate variability. This study highlights that in
   statistical trend tests, more than just one simple null model of
   intrinsic climate variability should be used. This allows one to better
   gauge the degree of confidence to have in the significance of trends.},

   three state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean models, cannot

Abstract = {Atmospheric warming and extreme weather events have increasingly become
   major contemporary issues of global concern, yet relatively few studies
   have investigated recent decadal-scale climate change and variability in
   Zimbabwe. This study investigates spatiotemporal temperature and extreme
   weather events in Mzingwane catchment of southern Zimbabwe for the
   period 1967-2015. This is achieved through using the Non-parametric
   Modified Mann-Kendal trend test, while magnitudes of trends are
   estimated using Sen's slope estimator. Temporal and spatial trends for
   extreme dryness and wetness are established by using the Standard
   Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index. The results for annual
   anomalies show a strong positive anomaly (.44 degrees C warmer) at all
   five stations for the summer months, while winter months recorded cool
   anomaly averaging -.28 degrees C. Trends in annual T-max significantly
   increased (p < .05) at an average of .16 degrees C decade(-1) at four
   stations, but excluding Matopos, which decreased significantly at .29
   degrees C decade(-1). The mean T-max for the period 1897-1904 was .7 and
   1.7 degrees C cooler than the reference average and 2000-2015 average
   respectively, while historic T-min is .3 and 2.1 degrees C cooler.
   Results of extreme events indicate a significant increase (p < .05) in
   the occurrence of extreme dry periods since the 1980s. The findings are
   important for developing appropriate sustainable and adaptive strategies
   as climate changes.},

   necessitates detailed study of the spatial and temporal variability of
   temperature. This paper focuses on the spatio-temporal trend analysis of
   minimum and maximum temperature over India. Daily gridded temperature
   data with spatial resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees for the period of
   1969-2005 were analysed using Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test at 3
   levels of significances, namely, 1\%, 5\%, and 10\%. The diurnal
   temperature range was also analysed. Results showed that maximum
   temperature experienced significant decreasing trends in the entire
   Indo-Gangetic plains extending up to the NE region while the Southern
   region experienced warming. For minimum temperature, all regions except
   the Central region reported increasing trends indicating warming. As a
   result, diurnal temperature range showed decreasing trends in many
   places in the upper half of the country while the lower half is
   dominated by increasing trends. On a regional scale, the Southern
   region, in particular, showed increasing trends in all three parameters.
   On seasonal scale, pre-monsoon and monsoon months remained mostly
   trendless for all three parameters. Maximum significant decreasing
   trends were observed during January-May while maximum increasing trends
   were reported during June-December. Also, a higher Sen slope value of
   the yearly maximum increase in the minimum temperature indicated steeper
   increase in minimum temperature over maximum temperature.},

Title = {Global Spatial Distributions of and Trends in Rice Exposure to High
   Temperature},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Due to the effects of global warming, extreme temperature events are
   posing a great threat to crop yields, especially to
   temperature-sensitive crops such as rice. In the context of disaster
   risk theory, exposure is central to disaster prevention and reduction.
   Thus, a comprehensive analysis of crop exposure is essential to better
   reduce disaster effects. By combining the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt)
   and a multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), this paper analyzed
   the global distribution and change in rice exposure to high temperature.
   The results showed the future states of rice after exposure to high
   temperatures. Our results are: (1) the areas of potential rice
   distribution zones decreased within the representative concentration
   pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP2.6 to RCP8.5 in MaxEnt, where the long-term
   (2061-2080) decreases are greater than those seen in the medium term
   (2041-2060). (2) In the future, the number of high temperature hazards
   in potential rice distribution areas increased. In the RCP8.5 scenario,
   the intensities of global high temperature hazards on rice were reduced
   because the total area of potential rice distribution zones decreased.
   (3) Through the view of barycenter shift, the barycenter of the global
   potential rice and high temperature hazard distributions showed a trend
   of backward motion, which meant the global rice exposure to high
   temperature was in a downward trend. With the background of global
   change, this paper has great significance for the mitigation of high
   temperature risk in rice and its effect on the potential security of
   future global rice production. Future research is warranted to
   concentrate on discussing more socioeconomic factors and increasing rice
   exposure change from the temporal vision.},

Title = {Pacific sea surface temperature linkages with Tanzania's multi-season
   drying trends},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Number = {6},
Pages = {3057-3075},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {During 1999-2014, Tanzania experienced below average precipitation in
   two important seasons: December to February (DJF) in the south and
   during March to June (MAMJ) in the northeast. We explore DJF and MAMJ
   precipitation in the areas with drying trends and examine their
   relationships with anomalous sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the
   Indo-Pacific and corresponding circulation patterns. At seasonal time
   scales, precipitation in DJF and MAMJ trend areas appears inversely
   related to diabatic forcing in the equatorial Pacific. Dominant
   influence for droughts in DJF is eastern Pacific SST while for droughts
   in MAMJ it is West Pacific SST. A bivariate regression model with West
   Pacific and Nino3.4 region SST as predictors is found to recreate
   multidecadal DJF variability after the 1950s and the extreme drying in
   MAMJ during the 2000s. The regression model coefficients also indicate
   differential eastern versus western Pacific forcing for DJF versus MAMJ.
   Thus, we suggest that recent La Nina-like conditions, characterized by
   an enhanced Pacific SST gradient due to cooling in the eastern Pacific
   and warming in the western Pacific, played a substantial role in
   Tanzania's recent multi-season drying trends. SST change scenarios
   (difference between 2023-2037 and 2000-2014 means) based on CMIP5
   projections and observed trends illustrate the uncertainty of future
   precipitation outcomes, as well as the potential implications of
   contrasting linkages to eastern versus western Pacific SSTs. These
   scenarios are mainly optimistic for the DJF southern Tanzania trend
   area, because it appears dominated by Nino3.4 cooling at both seasonal
   and decadal time scales. Conversely, our scenarios are quite pessimistic
   for the MAMJ northeastern Tanzania trend area, because we find a
   dominant negative influence of warming West Pacific SST.},

Title = {Model-Derived Uncertainties in Deep Ocean Temperature Trends Between
   1990 and 2010},

Abstract = {We construct a novel framework to investigate the uncertainties and
   biases associated with estimates of deep ocean temperature change from
   hydrographic sections and demonstrate this framework in an
   eddy-permitting ocean model. Biases in estimates from observations arise
   due to sparse spatial coverage (few sections in a basin), low frequency
   of occupations (typically 5-10years apart), mismatches between the time
   period of interest and span of occupations, and from seasonal biases
   relating to the practicalities of sampling during certain times of year.
   Between the years 1990 and 2010, the modeled global abyssal ocean biases
   are small, although regionally some biases (expressed as a heat flux
   into the 4,000- to 6,000-m layer) can be up to 0.05W/m(2). In this
   model, biases in the heat flux into the deep 2,000- to 4,000-m layer,
   due to either temporal or spatial sampling uncertainties, are typically
   much larger and can be over 0.1W/m(2) across an ocean. Overall, 82\% of
   the warming trend deeper than 2,000m is captured by hydrographic
   section-style sampling in the model. At 2,000m, only half the model
   global warming trend is obtained from observational-style sampling, with
   large biases in the Atlantic, Southern, and Indian Oceans. Biases due to
   different sources of uncertainty can have opposing signs and differ in
   relative importance both regionally and with depth, revealing the
   importance of reducing temporal and spatial uncertainties in future deep
   ocean observing design.
   Plain Language Summary In recent decades, deep (below 2,000m) ocean
   temperature trends have been measured when scientific research vessels
   repeat the same lines across an ocean basin. Repeats typically happen
   once or twice a decade, and there are only a few repeated lines across
   each basin. The sparsity of data in both space and time will result in
   errors in the multidecadal temperature trends calculated from this data.
   Here, we use a state-of-the-art ocean model to show how trends
   calculated from observational-style sampling compare to trends
   calculated using all model data. For the period 1990-2010, we estimate
   the error that may exist in observed deep ocean trend estimates.
   Overall, around 80\% of the below 2,000-m warming trend was captured by
   observational-style sampling in the model, so deep ocean warming in
   recent decades may have been underestimated. However, our results are
   based on only one model simulation. The largest sources of sampling
   error are found in the Atlantic, Southern, and Indian Oceans. For each
   basin, we reveal whether limited sampling in time or space contributes
   most error to the temperature trend estimate, and therefore in which
   regions temperature trend estimates would benefit from additional deep
   ocean sampling.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics
   of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradients in the South Atlantic Ocean
   (SAO) using satellite data. 12 years (2003-2014) of high resolution
   synoptic SST images acquired from NASA's MODIS instrument onboard Terra
   and Aqua platforms were processed to mitigate quality issues related to
   stripe noise and cloud misclassification and then compiled into monthly,
   yearly, and decadal maps of SST gradient magnitudes. We used these
   composite maps and corresponding time series to identify regions with
   strong frontal activity and characterize the seasonal and long term
   evolution of thermal gradients. While a clear seasonal cycle was
   observed in most subregions of the SAO, the satellite data do not
   suggest significant interannual variability or long term changes in the
   magnitude of thermal fronts in the SAO except in the upwelling region of
   Cape Frio Brazil, where SST gradients have increased at an approximate
   rate of 1\% per year since 2003. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Previous assessments of historical trends of measured surface
   temperature in South Africa have all shown a general upward trend, in
   both mean and extreme values, over recent decades. In addition, some
   regional differences in trends have been identified. Most of these
   studies focused on the period from about 1961 up to the last year that
   could be included before publication, and only climate stations situated
   in the same position for the entire analysis period were analysed. A
   data homogenization procedure enabled the combination of time series of
   stations from which trend analysis could be applied, extending the
   common analysis period for this study back to around 1931. The trend
   results, based on the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on
   Climate Change Detection and Indices, continue to show the general
   warming trend shown in previous analyses, with a general increase in
   extreme warm events and a general decrease in extreme cold events across
   South Africa. The analysis of seasonal trends show that, while there are
   noteworthy differences on a regional basis, austral summer shows on
   average the strongest warming, followed by autumn, winter and spring.
   The central interior, which exhibited significant cooling in previous
   analyses, now shows non-significant or similar trends when compared to
   the other parts of South Africa. There is no countrywide acceleration in
   the warming trends, but some regional consistencies in the temporal
   changes in trends could be determined, i.e. increases in trends in the
   central interior and decreases in trends along most of the coastal
   region.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assess the variation and trends of the mean
   daily maximum and minimum temperatures in the Segura River basin (Spain)
   during the second half of the 20th century. To characterise the temporal
   evolution of these parameters in the Segura River basin (Spain), we
   obtained the temporal series corresponding to the monthly average of the
   daily maximum and minimum temperature from an extensive dataset of
   meteorological stations in the SE peninsular, After a rigorous process
   of quality control and homogenisation of the selected series, a 58 year
   dataset (1940-1997) was constructed from 23 stations in the Segura River
   basin. We analysed the annual and seasonal evolution of the maximum and
   minimum temperatures for three areas (Mountain, High plateau, and Low
   fertile plain/coast). The results indicate a significant increase in
   both variables, but more intense in the maximum temperatures in the
   Mountain region, and in the minimum temperature in the Low fertile
   plain. These results are consistent with the intensification of
   anticyclonic situations proposed by other authors.},

Abstract = {Rising temperature has increased the frequency, severity, length, and
   timing of temperature extremes around the globe. The current study
   examined the spatiotemporal variation of Tmin, Tmax, Tmean, and diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) over homogeneous climatic zones of Pakistan,
   using observed monthly datasets from fifty stations for the period
   1961-2017. The nonparametric modified Mann-Kendall (MMK), Sen's slope
   estimator (SSE), and sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) tests were utilized
   to investigate the spatiotemporal trends. Cluster analysis and the
   L-moment approach were used to identify the homogenous climatic regions.
   In general, seasonal and annual Tmin, Tmax, Tmean, and DTR increased
   significantly in most sub-regions and the whole country, whereas JJA
   observed significant decreasing trends in Tmin, Tmax, and Tmean in most
   sub-regions during 1961-2017. Furthermore, decreasing trends prevailed
   in seasonal and annual Tmin in most sub-regions and the whole country
   during 1961-1989, whereas increasing trends were evident during
   1990-2017. Tmean exhibited increasing trends on the seasonal and annual
   time scale in both periods except significant decrease in JJA at -0.16
   and -0.20 degrees C/decade in the first and second periods,
   respectively. Tmax, Tmean, and DTR inferred decreasing trends in JJA at
   -0.42, -0.20, and -0.46 degrees C/decade, respectively, while Tmax and
   DTR had significant decrease in SON at -0.30 and -46 degrees C/decade,
   respectively, in the whole country during 1990-2017. The SQMK results
   indicate that Tmin, Tmax, Tmean, and DTR observed an increasing trend in
   DJF and MAM from 1985 onwards, and most of the regions observed
   significant trends from mid-2000. A negative correlation was observed
   between annual Tmin and Tmean with elevation, whereas a positive
   correlation was observed between annual Tmax and DTR with elevation.
   Pakistan has experienced numerous extreme events like heatwaves and
   droughts recently. Therefore, future research should investigate changes
   in air fluxes caused by zonal circulation and anticyclone conditions to
   explain the temperature variability.},

Title = {Moisture and temperature influences on nonlinear vegetation trends in
   Serengeti National Park},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While long-term vegetation greening trends have appeared across large
   land areas over the late 20th century, uncertainty remains in
   identifying and attributing finer-scale vegetation changes and trends,
   particularly across protected areas. Serengeti National Park (SNP) is a
   critical East African protected area, where seasonal vegetation cycles
   support vast populations of grazing herbivores and a host of ecosystem
   dynamics. Previous work has shown how non-climate drivers (e.g. land
   use) shape the SNP ecosystem, but it is still unclear to what extent
   changing climate conditions influence SNP vegetation, particularly at
   finer spatial and temporal scales. We fill this research gap by
   evaluating long-term (1982-2016) changes in SNP leaf area index (LAI) in
   relation to both temperature and moisture availability using Ensemble
   Empirical Mode Decomposition and Principal Component Analysis with
   regression techniques. We find that SNP LAI trends are nonlinear,
   display high sub-seasonal variation, and are influenced by lagged
   changes in both moisture and temperature variables and their
   interactions. LAI during the long rains (e.g. March) exhibits a
   greening-to-browning trend reversal starting in the early 2000s, partly
   due to antecedent precipitation declines. In contrast, LAI during the
   short rains (e.g. November, December) displays browning-to-greening
   alongside increasing moisture availability. Rising temperature trends
   also have important, secondary interactions with moisture variables to
   shape these SNP vegetation trends. Our findings show complex
   vegetation-climate interactions occurring at important temporal and
   spatial scales of the SNP, and our rigorous statistical approaches
   detect these complex climate-vegetation trends and interactions, while
   guarding against spurious vegetation signals.},

Abstract = {Elevated CO2 concentrations increase photosynthesis and, potentially,
   net ecosystem production (NEP), meaning a greater CO2 uptake. Climate,
   nutrients and ecosystem structure, however, influence the effect of
   increasing CO2. Here we analysed global NEP from MACC-II and Jena
   CarboScope atmospheric inversions and ten dynamic global vegetation
   models ( TRENDY), using statistical models to attribute the trends in
   NEP to its potential drivers: CO2, climatic variables and land-use
   change. We found that an increased CO2 was consistently associated with
   an increased NEP (1995-2014). Conversely, increased temperatures were
   negatively associated with NEP. Using the two atmospheric inversions and
   TRENDY, the estimated global sensitivities for CO2 were 6.0 +/- 0.1, 8.1
   +/- 0.3 and 3.1 +/- 0.1 PgC per 100 ppm (similar to 1 degrees C
   increase), and -0.5 +/- 0.2, -0.9 +/- 0.4 and -1.1 +/- 0.1 PgC degrees
   C-1 for temperature. These results indicate a positive CO2 effect on
   terrestrial C sinks that is constrained by climate warming.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a global challenge which impacts negatively on
   sustainable rural livelihoods, public health and economic development,
   more especially for communities in Southern Africa. Assessment of
   indices that signify climate change can inform formulation of relevant
   adaptation strategies and policies for the communities. Diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) is acknowledged as an expedient measure of the
   scourge as it is sensitive to variations in radiative energy balance. In
   this study, a long-term (1961-2010) daily temperature data obtained from
   nine (9) synoptic stations in Botswana were analyzed for monotonic
   trends and epochal changes in annual maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min)
   temperatures and DTR time series. Most of the considered stations were
   along the Kalahari Transect, a region which is at high risk of extensive
   environmental change due to climate change. Mann-Kendall trend and
   Lepage tests were applied for trend and change point analysis,
   respectively. The statistical analysis shows that stations in the
   southern part of the country experienced significant negative trends in
   annual DTR at the rate of -0.09 to -0.30 degrees C per decade due to
   steeper warming rates in annual T-min than annual T-max trends. On the
   contrary, stations in the northern part of the country experienced
   positive trends in annual DTR brought about by either a decreasing
   annual T-min trend which outstripped annual T-max or annual T-max which
   outpaced annual T-min. The increasing trends in DTR varied from 0.25 to
   0.67 degrees C per decade. For most of the stations, the most
   significant annual DTR trends change point was in 1982 which coincided
   with the reversal of atmospheric circulation patterns.},

Title = {Current Trends in Upper Water Layer Temperature in Coastal Zones of
   Baikal},
Journal = {GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Based on the data from 17 meteorological stations, we have analysed the
   characteristics of the temperature change within the surface water layer
   (0.2-0.5 m) in the coastal zone of Lake Baikal. It was determined that
   during 1970-2016, the average temperature trend in May-September was
   increasing from Southern Baikal to Central and Northern Baikal due to a
   combination of physical- geographical features (heat from the sun,
   orography of the coastal mountains and underwater slopes, wind
   conditions, and water dynamics) in the lake basin. It was established
   that the low value of the trend in Southern Baikal is due to a
   relatively poor protection of its water area by the Primorskii Ridge
   (approximately 800 m high) from strong winds of the western quarter. It
   was found that an increased wind activity causes a more pronounced
   wind-wave mixing in the upper layers as well as more frequent
   upwellings/downwellings which also involve the waters from the deeper
   layers in the exchange with the upper water layers. In the Central
   Baikal basin, the influence of the water mass on the atmospheric
   circulation in the surface layer is the most obvious. Its consequence
   implies high atmospheric transparency and decreased cloudiness over the
   lake leading to an increase in incident solar radiation in the upper
   water layers. The high temperature trends, compared to the other parts
   of Baikal, correspond to the Northern Baikal basin best protected from
   the strong westerly winds by the Baikalskii Ridge (up to 2500 m high).
   Over the past two decades (1994-2016), the trend of warming of the
   surface water layer has decreased significantly, along with an increase
   in the warming rate of Central and Southern Baikal. Using data of
   deep-water temperature monitoring in Southern Baikal, we estimated the
   spatial scales of the identical response of the surface temperature and
   the lake water column to climate change.},

Abstract = {Updated tropical lower tropospheric temperature datasets covering the
   period 1979-2009 are presented and assessed for accuracy based upon
   recent publications and several analyses conducted here. We conclude
   that the lower tropospheric temperature (T-LT) trend over these 31 years
   is +0.09 +/- 0.03 degrees C decade(-1). Given that the surface
   temperature (T-sfc) trends from three different groups agree extremely
   closely among themselves (similar to +0.12 degrees C decade(-1)) this
   indicates that the. scaling ratio. (SR, or ratio of atmospheric trend to
   surface trend: T-LT/T-sfc) of the observations is similar to 0.8 +/-
   0.3. This is significantly different from the average SR calculated from
   the IPCC AR4 model simulations which is similar to 1.4. This result
   indicates the majority of AR4 simulations tend to portray significantly
   greater warming in the troposphere relative to the surface than is found
   in observations. The SR, as an internal, normalized metric of model
   behavior, largely avoids the confounding influence of short-term
   fluctuations such as El Ninos which make direct comparison of trend
   magnitudes less confident, even over multi-decadal periods.},

Journal = {OCEAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {491-501},
Abstract = {There is growing understanding that recent deterioration of the Black
   Sea ecosystem was partly due to changes in the marine physical
   environment. This study uses high resolution 0.25 degrees climatology to
   analyze sea surface temperature variability over the 20th century in two
   contrasting regions of the sea. Results show that the deep Black Sea was
   cooling during the first three quarters of the century and was warming
   in the last 15-20 years; on aggregate there was a statistically
   significant cooling trend. The SST variability over the Western shelf
   was more volatile and it does not show statistically significant trends.
   The cooling of the deep Black Sea is at variance with the general trend
   in the North Atlantic and may be related to the decrease of westerly
   winds over the Black Sea, and a greater influence of the Siberian
   anticyclone. The timing of the changeover from cooling to warming
   coincides with the regime shift in the Black Sea ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Having analyzed a global grid temperature anomaly data set and some sea
   level pressure data during the last century, we round the following
   facts. Firstly, the annual temperature change with a warming trend of
   about 0.6 degreesC / 100 years in the tropical area over Indian to the
   western Pacific Oceans was most closely correlated to the glob:ll mean
   change. Therefore, the temperature change in this area might serve as an
   indicator of global mean change at annual and longer time scales.
   Secondly, a cooling of about -0.3 degreesC / 100 years occurred over the
   northern Atlantic. Thirdly, a two-wave pattern of temperature change,
   warming over northern Asia and northwestern America and cooling over the
   northern Atlantic and the northern Pacific, occurred during the last
   half century linked to strengthening westerlies over the northern
   Atlantic and the weakening Siberian High. Fourthly. a remarkable
   seasonal difference occurred over the Eurasian continent, with cooling
   (warming) in winter (summer) during 1896-1945. and warming (cooling) in
   winter (summer) during 1946-1995. The corresponding variations of the
   North Atlantic Oscillation and the Southern Oscillation were also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Surface temperature was measured at the Pic du Midi de Bigorre, 2862 m
   MSL, from the foundation of the Observatory in 1878 until the closing of
   the meteorological station in 1984.  After testing the homogeneity of
   the series with the annual mean temperatures in western Europe and in
   southwestern France, the period 1882-1970 was retained for trend
   analysis.
   The mean annual temperature increased 0.83-degrees-C during the 89-yr
   period.  This increase is the sum of a very significant increase in the
   daily minimum temperature (+2.11-degrees-C) and a decrease in the
   maximum temperature (-0.45-degrees-C).  In consequence, the most
   dramatic change in the temperature regime was the difference between
   maximum and minimum; this decreased from 8.05-degrees-C in 1882 to
   5.49-degrees-C in 1970.  A mean increase is observed in all seasons,
   but, as for western Europe, it is stronger in spring and fall than in
   winter and summer.
   Analysis of cloudiness data for the same period shows a 15\% increase in
   annual mean cloudiness and also significant year-to-year correlations
   between cloudiness and the maximum and minimum temperatures.  In
   consequence, the change in temperature regime observed at the Pic du
   Midi since the end of last century is most probably the result of a
   climatic change involving an increase in cloud cover and, maybe, an
   increasing greenhouse effect.},

Abstract = {The current paper analyses the recent trends of Red Sea surface
   temperature (SST) using 0.25 degrees daily gridded Optimum Interpolation
   Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) data from 1982 to 2016. The results of 3
   different GFDL (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) model simulations
   are used to project the sea surface temperature (hereafter called Tos)
   under the four representative concentration pathway scenarios through
   2100.
   The current research indicates that the spatially annual mean (from 1982
   to 2016) Red Sea surface temperature is 27.88 +/- 12.14 degrees C, with
   a significant warming trend of 0.029 degrees C yr(-1). The annual SST
   variability during the spring/autumn seasons is two times higher than
   during the winter/summer seasons. The Red Sea surface temperature is
   correlated with 13 different studied parameters, the most dominant of
   which are mean sea level pressure, air temperature at 2 m above sea
   level, cross-coast wind stress, sensible heat flux, and Indian Summer
   Monsoon Index.
   For the Red Sea, the GFDL-CM3 simulation was found to produce the most
   accurate current SST among the studied simulations and was then used to
   project future scenarios. Analysis of GFDL-CM3 results showed that Tos
   in the Red Sea will experience significant warming trends with an
   uncertainty ranging from 0.6 degrees C century(-1) to 3.2 degrees C
   century(-1) according to the scenario used and the seasonal variation.

Abstract = {Urban air temperature studies usually focus on the urban canopy heat
   island phenomenon, whereby the city center experiences higher near
   surface air temperatures compared to its surrounding non-urban areas.
   The Land Surface Temperature (LST) is used instead of urban air
   temperature to identify the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI). In this
   study, the nighttime LST and SUHI characteristics and trends in the
   seventeen largest Mediterranean cities were investigated, by analyzing
   satellite observations for the period 2001-2012. SUHI averages and
   trends were based on an innovative approach of comparing urban pixels to
   randomly selected non-urban pixels, which carries the potential to
   better standardize satellite-derived SUHI estimations. A positive trend
   for both LST and SUHI for the majority of the examined cities was
   documented. Furthermore, a 0.1 A degrees C decade(-1) increase in urban
   LST corresponded to an increase in SUHI by about 0.04 A degrees C
   decade(-1). A longitudinal differentiation was found in the urban LST
   trends, with higher positive values appearing in the eastern
   Mediterranean. Examination of urban infrastructure and development
   factors during the same period revealed correlations with SUHI trends,
   which can be used to explain differences among cities. However, the
   majority of the cities examined show considerably increased trends in
   terms of the enhancement of SUHI. These findings are considered
   important so as to promote sustainable urbanization, as well as to
   support the development of heat island adaptation and mitigation plans
   in the Mediterranean.},

Abstract = {Ever increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are one of the most
   dominant factors for long-term changes in the tropospheric temperature
   variations. To study this fact in the wake of changing global climatic
   scenario, linear trends in surface temperature and the tropospheric

   150 hPa) were examined for the period 1971-2015 across India. The mean
   monthly temperature data for well-spread 19 radiosonde stations across
   India were used to examine the seasonal and annual temperature trends
   for all India, North India (latitude > 22 degrees N), and South India
   (latitude < 22 degrees N). Increasing trend in annual temperatures was
   observed from surface to 500 hPa levels but decreasing from 200 to 150
   hPa over South India, whereas North India shows an increasing trend at
   all the levels. The highest increasing trends of 0.36 degrees C and 0.27
   degrees C/decade were observed at 700 hPa over North and South India
   during the winter season, respectively.},

Abstract = {Long-term surface air temperatures at 1.5m screen level over land are
   used in calculating a global average surface temperature trend. This
   global trend is used by the IPCC and others to monitor, assess, and
   describe global warming or warming hiatus. Current knowledge of
   near-surface temperature trends with respect to height, however, is
   limited and inadequately understood because surface temperature
   observations at different heights in the surface layer of the world are
   rare especially from a high-quality and long-term climate monitoring
   network. Here we use high-quality two-height Oklahoma Mesonet
   observations, synchronized in time, fixed in height, and situated in
   relatively flat terrain, to assess temperature trends and
   differentiating temperature trends with respect to heights (i.e.,
   near-surface lapse rate trend) over the period 1997 to 2013. We show
   that the near-surface lapse rate has significantly decreased with a
   trend of -0.18 +/- 0.03 degrees C (10 m)(-1) per decade indicating that
   the 9m height temperatures increased faster than temperatures at the
   1.5m screen level and/or conditions at the 1.5m height cooled faster
   than at the 9m height. However, neither of the two individual height
   temperature trends by themselves were statistically significant. The
   magnitude of lapse rate trend is greatest under lighter winds at night.
   Nighttime lapse rate trends were significantly more negative than
   daytime lapse rate trends and the average lapse rate trend was three
   times more negative under calm conditions than under windy conditions.
   Our results provide the first observational evidence of near-surface
   temperature changes with respect to height that could enhance the
   assessment of climate model predictions.},

Abstract = {The deletion of a trend as an initial step in the analysis of climatic
   time series may result in the elimination of low-frequency components
   which constitute an integral part of climatic variability. An example is
   given here showing that linear trend deletion from the time series of
   the World Ocean annual sea-surface temperature (1850-2009) reduces the
   low-frequency (from 0.02 year(-1) to 0.001 year(-1)) part of the time
   series spectrum by similar to 40\% to 80\% thus severely distorting the
   spectrum of climate. As an additional result, it is shown that the
   current warming can be explained in full within the framework of a
   stationary stochastic model fitted directly to the time series of annual
   sea-surface temperature (SST) from 1850 through 2009 with no trend
   deletion. According to the model, the recurrence time of runs of
   generally increasing temperature by similar to 0.5 degrees C lasting for
   several decades (as has been observed since about 1956) is about 500
   years for the World Ocean. Thus, the current run of growing SST is not
   an extremely rare event in climate and can be explained as a part of the
   natural climatic variability. These results show that deleting linear
   trends requires a thorough preliminary analysis. It is suggested that
   the approach described here can be used to improve physical models of
   the World Ocean climate.},

Title = {Potential biases in inferring Holocene temperature trends from long-term
   borehole information},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {We use a set of global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation
   (OAGCM) experiments for timeslices over the Holocene from 9K Yr BP
   onwards to examine differences in Northern Hemisphere Ground Surface
   Temperature (GST) and Surface Air Temperature (SAT) trends. The model
   results are driven mainly by the orbitally-forced changes in seasonal
   insolation, and in particular, the increase in northern hemisphere
   seasonality in the early-to-mid Holocene. The model reproduces
   qualitatively presumed past trends in NH temperatures, though it may
   underestimate their magnitude. For this period, we see on average a
   significant increase in GST relative to SAT as a result of a competition
   between the effects of changing seasonal insolation, and the varying
   extent of insulating seasonal snow cover. The model shows a mid-Holocene
   peak in annual mean terrestrial Northern Hemisphere GST, but not in
   annual Surface Air Temperatures (SAT). We conclude that the factors
   influencing long-term GST trends are potentially quite complex, and that
   considerable care must be taken in interpreting SAT changes from the GST
   evidence when there is the possibility of substantial seasonal variation
   in warmth and snow cover. Citation: Mann, M. E., G. A. Schmidt, S. K.

Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {The increasing ocean warming due to climate change significantly
   threatens regional marine ecosystems by raising the frequency and
   severity of extreme temperature events. This study examines patterns and
   trends of maximum annual sea surface temperature (Tmax) in the Eastern
   China Seas from 1985 to 2022. The results show a significant warming
   trend in Tmax, exceeding the global average, with notable differences
   between southern and northern regions. The northern Tmax warming rate is
   faster, with occurrence times significantly advancing, while the
   southern Tmax warming rate is slower, with occurrence times
   significantly delayed. The southern Tmax and its timing are closely
   correlated with the annual maximum air temperature and its timing. In
   the north, Tmax timing is influenced by latent heat flux (QLH); a
   significant increase in August QLH inhibits the continued rise of SST,
   causing Tmax to advance. The study also highlights a significant
   increase in marine heatwaves at Tmax timing, with higher Tmax indicating
   a higher occurrence probability. By elucidating these Tmax trends and
   dynamics, our study enhances understanding of regional climate impacts,
   supporting targeted conservation efforts and adaptive ecosystem
   management strategies in the Eastern China Seas.},

Abstract = {Synoptic temperature variability gives rise to cold waves and extreme
   cold events in winter. Based on four reanalysis datasets, this study
   investigates the decadal trend of synoptic temperature variability in
   boreal winter during the period from 1980 to 2019, with particular focus
   on the sharp drops in synoptic-scale temperature, which are associated
   with cold waves. The result shows that the synoptic-scale standard
   deviation of temperature decreases significantly with a trend of - 0.15
   K/decade (- 0.09 to - 0.21 K/decade among reanalysis datasets) over
   continental regions in mid-high latitudes. Correspondingly, the rapid
   cooling events (RCEs), defined based on the day-to-day temperature
   decrease exceeding 6 K, also show a general decreasing trend in terms of
   their frequency and intensity. The strongest decrease occurs over
   eastern North America (ENA) and western Eurasia (WE). The weakening of
   the RCEs is closely connected to the decreased trend of eddy kinetic
   energy (EKE), suggesting that the weakened transient eddy activities may
   have mitigated the synoptic-scale temperature variability and the
   associated RCEs over mid-high latitudes. This study highlights that the
   decreased synoptic temperature variability leads to fewer and weaker
   RCEs on the synoptic scale over mid-high latitudes in winter though the
   mean state of winter temperature continues to warm.},

Abstract = {We analyze the past 67,000 years of climate using Antarctic ice-core
   records to constrain the mechanisms involved in (a) the ``bipolar
   seesaw{''} relationship between Greenland and Antarctic surface
   temperature variations, and (b) mechanisms of millennial-scale
   atmospheric CO2 concentration variations. Specifically, we determine for
   each Greenland Stadial the rate of Antarctic temperature and atmospheric
   CO2 rise. We find that Antarctic warming rates significantly decrease as
   the climate cools during the glacial period, whereas the rate of
   atmospheric CO2 rise does not significantly change. Also, we find that
   the rates of Antarctic warming and atmospheric CO2 rise are both
   insensitive to whether a given stadial contains a Heinrich event. These
   results challenge the view that a single Southern-Ocean-based mechanism
   dominates the observed glacial variability in Antarctic temperature and
   atmospheric CO2. Instead, our results are consistent with an important
   contribution of low- and mid-latitude processes to millennial-scale
   atmospheric CO2 changes.},

Abstract = {Global warming and its climatic and environmental effects have mainly
   been investigated in terms of the absolute warming rate. Little
   attention has been paid to the contribution of absolute warming rate to
   variability on various time scales of surface air temperature (SAT),
   which may be a more direct index for measuring the ecoclimatic effect of
   warming trend. The present study analyzed the role of secular warming
   trend in the variations of global land SAT for 1901-2016. Less than
   one-third of annual SAT variations were contributed by the warming trend
   over large parts of the globe generally. The ratios were up to
   two-thirds over eastern South America, parts of South Africa and the
   regions around the southwestern Mediterranean and Sunda islands where
   the absolute warming rate was moderate but the endemic species were
   undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. The ratios also exhibited
   smallest seasonal difference over these regions. Therefore, the ratio of
   the warming trend to the SAT variations may be a better measure compared
   to the absolute warming rate for the local ecoclimate. We should also
   pay more attention to the regions with high ratio, not only the regions
   with the high absolute warming rate.},

Abstract = {We have updated long-term trends in mesopause temperature, airglow
   emission intensities, and noctilucent clouds (NLCs) based on
   ground-based observations conducted in the Moscow region (Russia).
   Trends in mesopause temperature and airglow emissions have been derived
   for the period 2000-2018 (19 years), and long-term trends in NLC
   characteristics have been obtained for 1968-2018 (51 years). Trends in
   airglow emissions have been estimated separately for winter and summer
   seasons. There are statistically significant negative trends in
   molecular oxygen O-2 A(0-1) and hydroxyl OH(6-2) emission intensities in
   both winter and summer. Responses of the airglow intensities to solar
   activity have been found to be significantly positive, with winter ones
   being 1.5-2 times greater than summer ones. There is a rather strong and
   statistically significant cooling of the summer mesopause at a rate of
   -2.4 +/- 2.3 K/decade, whereas the winter mesopause demonstrates a small
   and statistically insignificant cooling of -0.4 +/- 2.2 K/decade. The
   response of the mesopause temperature to solar activity is positive and
   about 2 times greater in winter than in summer. We consider long-term
   trends in the summer mesopause temperature and NLC for the same time
   period and same geographical region. Secular trends in NLC parameters
   have been found to be small and statistically insignificant as observed
   from midlatitudes. NLCs demonstrate statistically significant negative
   response to solar activity. Ozone forcing produces minor effects on both
   airglow and NLC characteristics. The observed small secular NLC trends
   contradict large modeled NLC trends recently obtained by Lubken et al.

Abstract = {Heavy duty (HD) vehicles are projected to be the largest fuel-use
   subsector in transportation, with current demand for diesel fuel
   projected to grow 30\% by 2040. Historically, a primary strategy for
   increasing diesel engine efficiency has been to increase peak cylinder
   pressure (PCP). However, increasing PCP imparts greater mechanical and
   thermal loads on engine components and materials. In recent years, the
   material property limits for many components have been reached and
   further increases in PCP above similar to 20 MPa have been difficult,
   while still maintaining the necessary affordability and longevity of
   on-road HD diesel engines. This paper reviews the historical evolution
   and major metallurgical advancements of high temperature materials in HD
   on road diesel engines (10-15 L displacement) up to the current state of
   the art, focusing on materials in the engine block, cylinder heads,
   pistons, valves, and exhaust components. These components cover a wide
   range of material classes, including cast iron, ferritic steel,
   austenitic steel, titanium alloys, nickel based super-alloys, and high
   temperature coatings. The micro structural degradation and failure
   mechanisms of the materials associated with the complex mechanical and
   thermal loading during service are discussed and key areas for future
   materials research are suggested that overcome technical barriers.},

   temperature records from the United States Historical Climatology
   Network covering the period from 1898 through 2008. We use the empirical

   each station. The statistical significance of each trend is assessed
   against three null models of the background climate variability,
   represented by stochastic processes of increasing temporal correlation
   length. We find strong evidence that more than 50\% of all stations
   experienced a significant trend over the last century with respect to
   all three null models. A spatiotemporal analysis reveals a significant
   cooling trend in the South-East and significant warming trends in the
   rest of the contiguous U. S. It also shows that the warming trend
   appears to have migrated equatorward. This shows the complex
   spatiotemporal evolution of climate change at local scales.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most important issues among researchers,
   scientists, planners and politicians in the present times. Of all the
   climatic elements, temperature plays a major role in detecting climatic
   change brought about by urbanization and industrialization. This paper,
   therefore, attempts to study the temperature changes at Dehradun city by
   analyzing the time series data of annual maximum, minimum and mean
   temperature from 1967 to 2007. Data for the study has been analyzed in
   three parts by running linear regression and by taking anomalies for the
   whole period from 1967 to 2007, phase one 1967-1987 and phase two
   1988-2007. The study of linear trend indicated increasing trends in
   annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean temperatures. During
   1967-2007 annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean temperatures
   increased about 0.43 degrees C, 0.38 degrees C and 0.49 degrees C,
   respectively. The analysis of temperature data in two phases also
   revealed an increase in annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean
   temperature. However, temperature increase in second phase was more
   pronounced in relation to first phase. During second phase (1988-2007)
   annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean temperatures increased
   about 0.42 degrees C, 0.59 degrees C and 0.54 degrees C, respectively.
   The perceptible increase in temperature during second phase is mainly
   attributed to urbanization and industrialization process initiated at
   Dehradun particularly after becoming the state capital of newly carved
   out state of Uttarakhand since the year 2000. The analysis also
   highlight significantly the role of extreme vulnerability of rising
   temperatures at Dehradun and urban population will constantly be
   affected by the change in the temperature which controls the comfort
   level of the inhabitants. Also, the rising temperatures in Doon valley
   are not a healthy signature for crop production and water resources in
   the region.},

Title = {Erroneous Arctic Temperature Trends in the ERA-40 Reanalysis: A Closer

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2011},

Number = {10},
Pages = {2620-2627},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Atmospheric reanalyses can be useful tools for examining climate
   variability and change; however, they must be used cautiously because of
   time-varying biases that can induce artificial trends. This study
   explicitly documents a discontinuity in the 40-yr European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) that leads
   to significantly exaggerated warming in the Arctic mid- to lower
   troposphere, and demonstrates that the continuing use of ERA-40 to study
   Arctic temperature trends is problematic. The discontinuity occurs in
   1997 in response to refined processing of satellite radiances prior to
   their assimilation into the reanalysis model. It is clearly apparent in
   comparisons of ERA-40 output against satellite-derived air temperatures,
   in situ observations, and alternative reanalyses. Decadal or
   multidecadal Arctic temperature trends calculated over periods that
   include 1997 are highly inaccurate, particularly below 600 hPa. It is
   shown that ERA-40 is poorly suited to studying Arctic temperature trends
   and their vertical profile, and conclusions based upon them must be
   viewed with extreme caution. Consequently, its future use for this
   purpose is discouraged. In the context of the wider scientific debate on
   the suitability of reanalyses for trend analyses, the results show that
   a series of alternative reanalyses are in broad-scale agreement with
   observations. Thus, the authors encourage their discerning use instead
   of ERA-40 for examining Arctic climate change while also reaffirming the
   importance of verifying reanalyses with observations whenever possible.},

Abstract = {The applications of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors represented by
   silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) in power modules are
   currently limited by the thermal stability of encapsulation materials,
   especially when operating temperatures raising to 200 ? or above.
   According to their glass transition temperatures (Tgs), the typical
   encapsulation materials are commonly divided into two categories: hard
   encapsulation materials (Tg > highest operating temperature) represented
   by epoxy (EP) resins and soft encapsulation materials (Tg < lowest
   operating temperature) represented by silicone gels (SGs). However, both
   materials face reliability challenges under high working temperatures
   (over 200 ?). In this work, recent progress for EPs and SGs was first
   discussed with Tgs and coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs),
   respectively. When considering EPs, their Tgs are usually around 150 ?,
   which is not sufficient enough for applications above 200 ?, while, for
   SGs, since they employ over Tgs, their high CTEs are not comparable with
   chips and other packaging materials, which leads to CTE mismatches for
   power modules' packaging. Therefore, a list of materials with high Tgs
   and proper CTEs was concluded for both academia research interests and
   industrial applications. High Tg polymers were introduced, including the
   EP-cyanate ester blend system, phthalonitrile, and bio-based polymers.
   Furthermore, innovative materials, including cement, glass, and
   insulating liquids, were also discussed. This article is established as
   a guideline for developing high-temperature encapsulation materials that
   offer a wide range of choices of materials and related selection
   criteria.},

Abstract = {Temperature sounding microwave radiometers flown on polar-orbiting
   weather satellites provide a long-term, global-scale record of
   upper-atmosphere temperatures, beginning in late 1978 and continuing to
   the present. The focus of this paper is the midtropospheric measurements
   made by the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) channel 2 and the Advanced
   Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) channel 5. Previous versions of the
   Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) dataset have used a diurnal climatology
   derived from general circulation model output to remove the effects of
   drifting local measurement time. This paper presents evidence that this
   previous method is not sufficiently accurate and presents several
   alternative methods to optimize these adjustments using information from
   the satellite measurements themselves. These are used to construct a
   number of candidate climate data records using measurements from 15 MSU
   and AMSU satellites. The new methods result in improved agreement
   between measurements made by different satellites at the same time. A
   method is chosen based on an optimized second harmonic adjustment to
   produce a new version of the RSS dataset, version 4.0. The new dataset
   shows substantially increased global-scale warming relative to the
   previous version of the dataset, particularly after 1998. The new
   dataset shows more warming than most other midtropospheric data records
   constructed from the same set of satellites. It is also shown that the
   new dataset is consistent with long-term changes in total column water
   vapor over the tropical oceans, lending support to its long-term
   accuracy.},

   generalized least squares},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {OCT 16},
Abstract = {Warming air temperatures induce ground warming and can therefore lead to
   permafrost degradation, which in turn may produce rock fall, debris
   flows, or cause serious problems for infrastructure stability. In the
   last two decades, many boreholes for thermal permafrost monitoring have
   been drilled in Alpine regions. Factors such as snow or scree cover,
   hydrology, or topography strongly affect the ground thermal regime and
   make trend estimation very difficult. Furthermore, ground temperature
   series exhibit a pronounced annual cycle and are strongly temporally
   correlated. For the sake of simplicity, often only annual values are
   analyzed for trend estimation, which is usually not robust for short
   measurement periods. This study intends to model time series with annual
   cycles and a daily database. A family of nine different models for trend
   estimation is proposed. The models are able to fit both overall trends
   and trends in the annual cycle amplitudes and therefore allow more
   robust and accurate trend estimation than when annual values only are
   used. Evaluation and comparison of the models is demonstrated using
   short-range (less than two decades, 1996-2008) permafrost temperature
   series from two adjacent boreholes in the Muot da Barba Peider ridge
   (Eastern Swiss Alps). The results suggest an increase in cycle
   amplitudes for near-surface coarse-blocky ground layers and an overall
   warming trend for deeper bedrock layers where the annual cycles are less
   pronounced.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates spatial variability of temperature trends over
   Libya in the second half of the 20th century. The study is based on
   complete and homogeneous time series of minimum, maximum, and mean
   temperature for ten observatories. During the investigated period
   (1951-1999), temperature trend analyses have experienced a downward
   trend in the maximum surface temperature (about -0.06 degrees C
   decade(-1)) and an upward trend in the minimum surface temperature
   (about 0.23 degrees C decade(-1)). Cooling tendency in maximum
   temperature is spatially more pronounced in inland stations compared to
   coastal stations. At the seasonal scale, maximum temperature cooling is
   more obvious in winter and spring, meanwhile minimum temperature warming
   is more pronounced in summer and fall. In accordance with global trends,
   the surface mean temperature has moderately risen at an average rate of
   0.09 degrees C decade(-1). However, this trend has shown considerable
   temporal variability considering a more pronounced upward trend in
   summer and fall. In conjunction with other regional and global
   investigations, clear trends towards smaller diurnal range are presented
   (-0.28 degrees C decade-1).},

Abstract = {From radio wave observations in the LF range (phase height and
   absorption measurements) at mid-latitudes longterm trends have been
   derived for the meso- and lower thermosphere. In the regression analyses
   used the solar and geomagnetically introduced parts have also to be
   considered. From these trends information about mesospheric temperature
   trends have been estimated with a pronounced cooling of the mesosphere
   during the last decades (up to about -0.45 K/year in summer and up to
   about -0.35 K/year in winter). The derived temperature trends are in
   reasonable agreement with other experimental results. Model results
   taken into account the well-known trends in CO2 and ozone show also a
   mesospheric cooling, their trends are however smaller than the
   experimental results. (C) 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Trend and teleconnection analysis of temperature extremes in New South
   Wales, Australia},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 26},
Abstract = {This study investigates possible trends and teleconnections in
   temperature extremes in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Daily maximum
   and minimum temperature data covering the period 1971-2021 at 26
   stations located in NSW were used. Three indices, which focus on daily
   maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, and average daily
   temperature in terms of Excessive Heat Factor (EHF) were investigated to
   identify the occurrence of heatwaves (HWs). The study considered HWs of
   different durations (1-, 5-, and 10-days) in relation to intensity,
   frequency, duration, and their first occurrence parameters. Finally, the
   influences of three global climate drivers, namely - the El Ni \&
   ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM),
   and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) were investigated with associated
   heatwave attributes for extended Austral summers. In this study, an
   increasing trend in both hot days and nights was observed for most of
   the selected stations within the study area. The increase was more
   pronounced for the last decade (2011-2021) of the investigated time
   period. The number, duration and frequency of the heatwaves increased
   over time considering the EHF criterion, whereas no particular trend was
   detected in cases of TX90 and TN90. It was also evident that the first
   occurrence of all the HWs shifted towards the onset of the extended
   summer while considering the EHF criterion of HWs. The correlations
   between heatwave attributes and climate drivers depicted that heatwave
   over NSW was positively influenced by both the IOD and ENSO and
   negatively correlated with SAM. The findings of this study will be
   useful in formulating strategies for managing the impacts of extreme
   temperature events such as bushfires, floods, droughts to the most
   at-risk regions within NSW.},

Abstract = {Global warming has enduring consequences in the ocean, leading to
   increased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and subsequent environmental
   impacts, including coral bleaching and intensified tropical storms. It
   is imperative to monitor these trends to enable informed decision-making
   and adaptation. In this study, we comprehensively examine the methods
   for extracting long-term temperature trends, including STL,
   seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on LOESS (locally estimated
   scatterplot smoothing), and the linear regression family, which
   comprises the ordinary least-squares regression (OLSR), orthogonal
   regression (OR), and geometric-mean regression (GMR). The applicability
   and limitations of these methods are assessed based on experimental and
   simulated data. STL may stand out as the most accurate method for
   extracting long-term trends. However, it is associated with notably
   sizable computational time. In contrast, linear regression methods are
   far more efficient. Among these methods, GMR is not suitable due to its
   inherent assumption of a random temporal component. OLSR and OR are
   preferable for general tasks but require correction to accurately
   account for seasonal signal-induced bias resulting from the
   phase-distance imbalance. We observe that this bias can be effectively
   addressed by trimming the SST data to ensure that the time series
   becomes an even function before applying linear regression, which is
   named ``evenization{''}. We compare our methods with two commonly used
   methods in the climate community. Our proposed method is unbiased and
   better than the conventional SST anomaly method. While our method may
   have a larger degree of uncertainty than combined linear and sinusoidal
   fitting, this uncertainty remains within an acceptable range.
   Furthermore, linear and sinusoidal fitting can be unstable when applied
   to natural data containing significant noise.},

Title = {Influence of Stratospheric Ozone Changes on Stratospheric Temperature
   Trends in Recent Decades},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Associated with the recovery of stratospheric ozone, stratospheric
   cooling has decelerated since the late 1990s. This study investigates
   the contribution of ozone changes to the long-term stratospheric
   temperature trends in recent decades using satellite observations and
   model simulations. Observational analysis shows that total column ozone
   experienced little depletion in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and weak
   recovery in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in the period 1998-2020. It is
   found that the cease of stratospheric ozone depletion has reduced the
   stratospheric cooling from 1998 onwards, especially in the summer
   hemisphere. The correlation analysis indicates that the
   lower-stratospheric temperature is primarily regulated by ozone changes.
   The ozone recovery in the SH is associated with the weak warming in the
   lower stratosphere in the period 1998-2020 in summer. The impact of
   ozone changes is further isolated in the ozone-only experiments from
   CMIP6. We find that ozone depletion results in significant cooling in
   the summer hemisphere in the period 1979-1997, especially in the upper
   and lower stratosphere, while ozone recovery leads to significant
   warming in the summer hemisphere in the period 1998-2020 in the upper
   stratosphere. Our results also suggest that the wave-mean flow
   interactions associated with stratospheric ozone variations may play an
   important role in regulating the strength of polar vortex in winter.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the greatest threats that our civilization is
   facing because increases in extreme temperatures severely affect humans,
   the economy, and ecosystems. General circulation models, which
   adequately predict climate change around the world, are less accurate at
   regional levels. Therefore, trends must be locally assessed,
   particularly in regions such as the Baja California Peninsula, which is
   a thin mass of land surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of
   California. Herein, we discuss extreme temperature trends in the Baja
   California Peninsula and whether they are statistically significant
   based on the Spearman's nonparametric statistical test. For these
   purposes, 18 weather stations covering the entire region were analyzed,
   revealing that maximum temperatures for the hottest months are rising at
   a rate that is consistent with the RCP 8.5 scenario. Changes in minimum
   temperatures were also analyzed.},

Abstract = {Over the Upper Colorado River basin (UCRB), temperatures in widely used
   gridded data products do not warm as much as mean temperatures from a
   stable set of U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) stations,
   located at generally lower elevations, in most months of the year. This
   is contrary to expectations of elevation-dependent warming, which
   suggests that warming increases with elevation. These findings could
   reflect (a) a genuine absence of elevation-dependent warming in the
   region, (b) systematic non-climatic influences on either the USHCN
   stations or high-elevation stations, including known inhomogeneities
   related to changes in the time of observation and instrumentation, or
   (c) suppression of an elevation-dependent warming signal introduced by
   changes in the station network. While we cannot categorically dismiss
   the first two possibilities, we show here that over portions of the 20th
   century, gridded temperatures warm less than USHCN temperatures, and the
   difference cannot be explained by accounting for known inhomogeneities.
   These analyses suggest that changing station coverage in the UCRB has
   influenced trends in gridded temperature estimates that incorporate
   changing suites of stations over time. Specifically, increases in the
   number of high-elevation stations in the UCRB may have led to an
   underestimation of elevation-dependent warming, particularly during the
   spring. This phenomenon is unlikely limited to this specific basin and
   may be present in other high-elevation watersheds across the western
   United States},

Abstract = {Temperature is the principal factor that determines rice growth,
   development and ultimately grain yield. In this study, normal
   growing-degree-days (NGDD) and killing growing-degree-days (KGDD) were
   used to capture the different effects of normal and extreme temperatures
   on rice yields, respectively. Based on these indexes, we assessed the
   contributions of temperature variations to county-level rice yields
   across China during the historical period (1980-2008), and estimated the
   potential exposure of rice to extreme temperature stress in the near
   future (2021-2050). The results showed that historical temperature
   variations had measurable impacts on rice yields with a distinct spatial
   pattern: for different regions, such variations had contributed much to
   the increased rice yields in Northeast China (Region I) (0.59 \% yield
   year(-1)) and some portions of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (Region II)
   (0.34 \% yield year(-1)), but seriously hindered the improvements of
   rice yields in the Sichuan Basin (SB) (-0.29 \% yield year(-1)) and the
   southern cultivation areas (Region IV) (-0.17 \% yield year(-1)); for
   the entire country, half of the contributions were positive and the
   other half were negative, resulting in a balance pattern with an average
   of 0.01 \% yield year(-1). Under the RCP8.5 scenario, climate warming

   period, Region I, II and eastern China would be continually exposed to
   more severe cold stress than the other regions; Region III (including SB
   and the mid-lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLRYR)) would be the hot
   spot of heat stress.},

Abstract = {Annual global surface temperature and global land surface temperature
   trends are calculated for all possible periods of the historical record
   between 1850 and 2009. Two-dimensional parameter diagrams show the
   critical influence of the choice of start and end years on the
   calculated trend and associated temperature changes and suggest time
   scales required to establish robust trends.
   The largest trends and associated temperature changes are all positive
   and have occurred over periods ending in recent years. Substantial
   positive changes also occurred from the early twentieth century until
   the mid-1940s. The continents exhibit greater long-term warming than the
   global average overall, but less warming in the early part of the
   century (segments ending in the 1940s). The recent period of short-term
   cooling beginning in the late 1990s is neither statistically significant
   nor unusual in the context of trend variability in the full historical
   record.
   Global-mean and land surface temperature changes for periods ending in
   recent years and longer than about 90 years are extremely unlikely to
   have occurred by chance. In contrast, short-term trends over less than a
   few decades are generally not statistically significant. This implies
   significant contributions of decadal variability to trends estimated
   over such short time periods.},

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {119-131},
Abstract = {Annual variability and trends in winter wheat yields were evaluated for
   relationships to climate in 6 long-term experiments (in total 1915-2005)
   and regionally in 3 counties (1965-2008) in southern and central Sweden.
   The annual yield was predicted as function of a climate index and year.
   Alternative indices were used based on either monthly temperatures or
   yield predicted by a simple weather-driven crop growth simulation model.
   The main results were as follows. (1) The yield predictions were better
   for regions than for the long-term experiments. (2) The time variable
   accounted for more of the yield trend in regions than in the
   experiments, and more in southern than in central Sweden. (3) The models
   based on a simple temperature index were often better yield predictors
   than the growth model. (4) The relations to winter temperatures became
   gradually weaker after ca. 1970. (5) The yield relation to simple
   temperature indices differed between locations, similarly for
   experimental and regional yields. (6) The strongest influence of climate
   was estimated by means of the growth model predictions of regional
   yields in Gotland County. (7) The fraction of regional yield trends
   (1965-1996; ranging from 57 to 90 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) that could be
   attributed to climate was estimated greatest in the Gotland region (27
   to 64\%). For climate change assessments of winter wheat yield in
   central Sweden, the growth model considering temperature, radiation and
   water conditions during spring and summer would also need to include
   processes of overwintering.},

Abstract = {The analyses of ten-year ozonesonde observations from 1993 till 2002,
   over Taipei, Taiwan show influences of climate change. Despite huge
   increases in its precursor emissions in this region, there were little
   variations in tropospheric ozone. Results indicate a warmer troposphere,
   a statistically insignificant rising tropopause, 79 +/- 206 m per
   decade, and decreasing tropopause temperature at - 1.0 +/- 0.89 K per
   decade. The derived mean tropospheric ozone is 40.58 +/- 10.99 DU, and
   has a statistically insignificant small trend of -0.78 +/- 1.7 DU per
   decade. The derived ten-year vertical trends of temperature and ozone
   are inversely correlated with each other from the middle troposphere up
   to the lower stratosphere. The averaged monthly vertical temperature
   trends show a generally warmer middle troposphere. The tropospheric
   ozone monthly trend has small increases only in the lower troposphere
   during winter and spring. Strong decreases occur in summer, from the
   surface up into the stratosphere. For ozone variation, results suggest
   that influences of climate forcing are stronger than those from
   precursor increases. More frequent and/or intense convection in summer
   and other climate-induced effects may contribute to the less than
   expected ozone observed in the troposphere. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN},

Volume = {71},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Long-term trends and inter-annual and inter-decadal variabilities of the
   global land air temperature are analyzed by using the 110-year time
   series data over 8 sub-regions. The global mean temperature exhibits a
   generally increasing trend during the 100 year period with a rate of
   about 0.54-degrees-C/(100 years). However, the temperature has
   inter-decadal variabilities, with the largest warming for the recent 20
   years, but with a cooling trend during 1940-1970.
   Spectral analysis of the air temperature shows that there exist three
   dominant time scales with period ranges of several years, 10-20 years,
   and longer than 30 years. 2-7-year-period variations over the tropical
   sub-regions are greatly affected by El Nino and Southern Oscilation
   (ENSO) cycles, but those over the extratropical sub-regions are not so
   affected by ENSO.
   The 8-25-year band-pass-filtered variations have amplitudes of about
   0.1-degrees-C-0.2-degrees-C. Their phases were nearly the same over the
   whole sub-regions before about 1920, but became different between
   different sub-regions after 1920. The phases of this component of the
   global mean temperature agree quite well with those of the sunspot
   numbers in recent years after about 1960, but they were nearly out of
   phase before about 1920.
   The low-pass-filtered variations with periods longer than 30 years had a
   positive peak around 1930-1940 and negative peaks around 1890 and 1970.
   This component seems to contribute to the large warming during recent 10
   years.},

Pages = {10143-10157},

Abstract = {The temperature trend in the mesosphere and lower-thermosphere (MLT)
   region can be regarded as an indicator of climate change. Using
   temperature profiles measured by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using
   Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument during 2002-2023 and
   binning them based on the yaw cycle, we obtain a continuous dataset with
   a wide local time coverage at 50 degrees S-80 degrees N or 80 degrees
   S-50 degrees N. The seasonal change in temperature, caused by the
   forward drift in the SABER yaw cycle, is removed using the
   climatological temperature of the Naval Research Laboratory's Mass
   Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter Radar model (MSIS2.0). The corrected
   temperature without any waves is regarded as the mean temperature. At 50
   degrees S-50 degrees N, the cooling trends in the mean temperature are
   significant in the MLT region and are in agreement with previous
   studies. The novel finding is that the cooling trends of >= l2 K per
   decade exhibit seasonal symmetry and reach peaks of >= 6 K per decade at
   high latitudes around the summer solstice. Moreover, there are warming
   trends of 1-2.5 K per decade at an altitude range of 10-2-10-3 hPa,
   specifically at latitudes higher than 55 degrees N in October and
   December and at latitudes higher than 55 degrees S in April and August.
   Over the past 22 years, the mesopause temperature (altitude) in the
   northern summer polar region has been similar to 5-11 K (similar to 1
   km) colder (lower) than that in the corresponding southern region. The
   trends in the mesopause temperature are dependent on latitudes and
   months, but they are negative at most latitudes and reach larger
   magnitudes at high latitudes. These results indicate that the
   temperature in the high-latitude MLT region is more sensitive to dynamic
   changes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {613},
Number = {A},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Northwest China has experienced a warming-wetting climate featured by
   increasing temperature and precipitation during the past six decades.
   Recent studies suggested that the climate may have shifted from wetting
   to drying after the 1990s if changes in energy supply were considered.
   However, how the change in energy supply affects the dryness remains
   unclear. In this study, we quantified the dryness in Northwest China
   based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)
   which considers the impact of potential evapotranspiration estimated by
   the Penman-Monteith equation on dryness during 1961-2018. Then, the
   contributions of changes in meteorological variables (precipitation,
   temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and net radiation) to the
   dryness changes were estimated using a detrending technique. The results
   indicated that Northwest China experienced a wetting period (1961-1989)
   and then a drying period (1989-2018). During 1961-1989, increased
   precipitation and slowed wind were the main drivers of the wetting
   trend. During 1989-2018, although the increased precipitation and
   decline in solar radiation favored a wetting condition, warmer
   temperature, drier air (decrease in relative humidity), together with
   rebounded wind speed offset the wetting trend and resulted in
   significantly increasing dryness in Northwest China. The dryness would
   further increase if current climate trends continue in the future, which
   may have important implications for water management in Northwest China.},

Abstract = {Global warming will have an impact on nature in many ways, including
   rising sea levels and an increasing spread of infectious diseases. Land
   surface temperature is one of the many indicators that can be used to
   measure climate change on both a local and global scale. This study aims
   to analyze the change in land surface temperatures on New Guinea Island
   using a cubic spline method, autoregressive model, and multivariate
   regression. New Guinea Island was divided into 5 regions each consisting
   of 9 subregions. The data of each subregion was obtained from the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration moderate resolution
   imaging spectroradiometer database from 2000 to 2019. The average change
   in temperature was +0.012 degrees C per decade. However, the changes
   differed by region; significantly decreasing in the northwest at -0.107
   degrees C per decade (95\% CI: -0.207, -0.007), significantly increasing
   in the south at 0.201 degrees C per decade (95\% CI: 0.069, 0.333), and
   remaining stable in the centralnorth, southeast and northeast.},

Abstract = {A slowdown in the warming rate of the global mean surface temperature
   has been observed since late 1990s. However, it is still controversial
   whether the spatiotemporal variability of extreme temperature events
   will increase after global warming slowdown, and whether the regional
   diversity of change trends will increase. Here, we investigated the
   variations in extreme temperature indices over the Loess Plateau in
   China since 1961 and focused on the recent global warming slowdown
   (1998-2018). We found that, during 1961-2018, all the extreme
   temperature indices showed a significant warming trend and its intensity
   varied according to extreme temperature indices over different regions.
   A warming slowdown of annual mean temperature during 1998-2018 was
   primarily due to the slight increases of annual mean maximum
   temperatures (TXm) while the annual mean minimum temperature (TNm) still
   indicated prominently warming trends. During the recent warming slowdown
   period, the warm indices showed continued intensification of the warming
   trends, while the cold indices showed a slight cooling trend. Moreover,
   all extreme temperature indices showed the largest warming trend in
   summer and a slight cooling trend in winter. Overall, the extreme
   temperature events have become more diverse in spatial and temporal,
   indicating that regional climate are more unstable than previously
   reported for this region. Further analyses revealed that the extreme
   temperature events during the recent warming slowdown were primarily the
   result of the natural variability of the climate system, especially the
   large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions of the Pacific and Atlantic
   oceans.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {14},

Pages = {3738-3750},
Abstract = {The linear temperature trend of the last 40 yr (1955-94) in the upper
   Pacific Ocean above 400 m is studied using an objectively analyzed
   dataset and simulations of an ocean general circulation model. Both the
   data and simulations suggest a warming trend in the western tropical
   Pacific (10 degreesS-10 degreesN) near the surface and in the eastern
   tropical Pacific above 400 m but a cooling trend in the thermocline of
   the western tropical Pacific. In the midlatitude North Pacific (30
   degrees -50 degreesN), the temperature trend is positive east of 150
   degreesW but negative to the west.
   Simulated heat budget indicates that the temperature trend in the
   tropical Pacific may result from oceanic advection. In the central and
   western Pacific, the surface warming is associated with the reduction of
   cold advection from the off-equatorial divergent flow and the South
   Equatorial Current, while the cooling in the thermocline is related to
   the reduction of equatorward warm advection. In the eastern Pacific, the
   warming is associated with the reduction of upwelling. The reduction of
   these ocean currents, in turn, may result largely from the weakening of
   the trade winds.
   In the midlatitude North Pacific, the ocean temperature trends similarly
   may result from the oceanic advection associated with the reduction of
   the westerlies. The effect of net surface heat flux into the ocean is a
   damping factor to the sea surface temperature. These studies highlight
   the importance of oceanic advection in producing long-term temperature
   trends.},

Abstract = {Dissimilarities in temperature trends in space and time over the Indian
   region have been examined to look for signatures of aerosols' influence.
   Separate temperature time series for North and South India were
   constructed for dry (November-May) and wet (June-October) seasons.
   Temperature trend for the entire period 1901-2007 and different
   subperiods of 1901-1950, 1951-1990, 1971-2007, and 1991-2007 have been
   examined to isolate the aerosol and other greenhouse gas influences on
   temperatures. Maximum (daytime) temperatures during dry season
   corresponding to North and South India show significant warming trend of
   0.8 and 1.0 A degrees C per hundred years during the period 1901-2007,
   while minimum temperature shows nebulous trend of 0.2 and 0.3 A degrees
   C per hundred years over North and South India, respectively. During the
   wet season, maximum temperature shows nearly half of dry season maximum
   temperature warming trend. However, asymmetry is observed in dry season
   maximum temperature trend during post-industrial period 1951-1990
   wherein the North/South India shows decreasing/increasing trends, while
   during the recent period 1991-2007 trends are uniformly positive for
   both the regions. Spatial and temporal asymmetry in observed trends
   clearly point to the role of aerosols in lowering temperature trends
   over northern India. Atmospheric aerosols could cause a negative climate
   forcing that can modulate the regional surface temperature trends in a
   significant way. As this forcing acts differentially on day and night
   temperatures, trends in diurnal temperature range (DTR) provide a direct
   assessment of impacts of aerosols on temperature trends. Time series of
   diurnal temperature range for dry and wet seasons have been examined
   separately for North and South India. Over North India, the DTR for dry
   season has increased gradually during the period 1901-1970 and
   thereafter showed decreasing trend, while trends in temperature range
   over Southern India were almost opposite in phase with North India. The
   aerosol and greenhouse gases seem to play an important role in the
   spatial and temporal variability of temperature range over India.},

Abstract = {In this essay we discuss the development of and estimation of
   uncertainties in the global surface temperature record. We briefly
   discuss the similarities in and differences between the records from the
   institutions that produce such series. We then consider the numerous
   issues that must be addressed to enable accurate estimates to be
   derived. We consider these in their order of importance with respect to
   the record: biases in the sea surface temperature data, exposure of
   land-based thermometers before about 1900, urbanization effects in some
   series, and, finally, the homogeneity of individual land-based records.},

Abstract = {Temperature trends in a tidal flat of the Bahia Blanca estuary
   (Argentina) were analyzed during the period 2000 - 2007. Air, water and
   sediment temperatures were recorded every 10 minutes by a thermistor
   chain. Minimum temperatures showed an increasing trend, reaching 0,8
   degrees C/year (absolute minimum water temperature in winter) and 0,7
   degrees C/year (average minimum air temperature in spring). Average
   maximum summer temperatures at the air and sediment showed a negative
   trend of - 0.5C/year. Spectral analysis of the estuarine temperatures
   evidenced an interannual periodicity (2 - 6 year) at the air, water and
   sediment, showing a variability pattern associated to the typical
   periodicities of the ENSO (2 - 7 years). Correlation analysis among
   thermal anomalies and SOI suggested that air, water and sediment
   temperatures in the estuary are substantially influenced by remote
   forcing. The occurrence of El Nino events was coincident with higher
   than average air and water temperatures and vice versa during La Nina
   events.},

   significant negative correlation with temperature, so does NO, for which
   traffic (a nonseasonal activity) is the major source, and for which the
   negative correlation with temperature reflects seasonal boundary layer
   depth. variations. When concentrations of PAHs divided by NO, were
   plotted against temperature, no significant relationship was detected
   for any PAH, except fluorene, phenanthrene, and fluoranthene, For these
   PAHs, the relationship was positive, suggesting volatilization from
   surfaces may be appreciable. For samples collected simultaneously at the
   city center and urban background sites, greater negative
   temperature-dependence was observed at the latter location. Although
   this may he partly due to the fact that the enhanced reactivity of PAHs
   at higher temperatures exerts a greater influence at sites more distant
   from emissions; the dichotomy in temperature-dependent behavior and
   temporal trends may also be due to city center concentrations being
   ``buffered{''} by volatilization from surfaces to a greater extent than

Title = {Understanding past and future sea surface temperature trends in the
   Baltic Sea},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},

Abstract = {The Baltic Sea is one of the fastest-warming semi-enclosed seas in the
   world over the last decades, yielding critical consequences on physical
   and biogeochemical conditions and on marine ecosystems. Although
   long-term trends in sea surface temperature (SST) have long been
   attributed to trends in air temperature, there are however, strong
   seasonal and sub-basin scale heterogeneities of similar magnitude than
   the average trend which are not fully explained. Here, using
   reconstructed atmospheric forcing fields for the period 1850-2008,
   oceanic climate simulations were performed and analyzed to identify
   areas of homogenous SST trends using spatial clustering. Our results
   show that the Baltic Sea can be divided into five different areas of
   homogeneous SST trends: the Bothnian Bay, the Bothnian Sea, the eastern
   and western Baltic proper, and the southwestern Baltic Sea. A
   classification tree and sensitivity experiments were carried out to
   analyze the main drivers behind the trends. While ice cover explains the
   seasonal north/south warming contrast, the changes in surface winds and
   air-sea temperature anomalies (along with changes in upwelling
   frequencies and heat fluxes) explain the SST trends differences between
   the sub-basins of the southern part of the Baltic Sea. To investigate
   future warming trends climate simulations were performed for the period
   1976-2099 using two RCP scenarios. It was found that the seasonal
   north/south gradient of SST trends should be reduced in the future due
   to the vanishing of sea ice, while changes in the frequency of upwelling
   and heat fluxes explained the lower future east/west gradient of SST
   trend in fall. Finally, an ensemble of 48 climate change simulations has
   revealed that for a given RCP scenario the atmospheric forcing is the
   main source of uncertainty. Our results are useful to better understand
   the historical and future changes of SST in the Baltic Sea, but also in
   terms of marine ecosystem and public management, and could thus be used
   for planning sustainable coastal development.},

Abstract = {On 1 April 2017 China established Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province,
   which was described as `a strategy crucial for a millennium to come'. A
   point of interest for the public is to be aware of the historical
   climate change in this new area; however, results from previous
   global-scale or larger-regional- scale averages provide relatively
   limited information because of the distinct regional differences in
   climate change. This study analyzes the changes in mean and extreme
   temperature in this area, based on homogenized daily temperature data
   for the period 1960-2016. The results show a significant warming in the
   indices of annual, summer, and winter mean temperature (T-mean), maximum
   temperature (T-max), and minimum temperature (T-min). The linear rate of
   annual T-mean is 0.34 degrees C/decade. Temperatures on the hottest day,
   the warmest night, the coldest day, and the coldest night, every year,
   all show increasing trends, with the trends in the two nighttime-related
   indices being significant. An increasing occurrence of warm days, warm
   nights, hot days, and tropical nights, but a decreasing occurrence of
   cold days, cold nights, icing days, and frost days, are found, all of
   which are significant, except for the occurrences of hot days and icing
   days. A significant extension of the length of the thermal growing
   season is also found. The magnitudes of change in most of the
   temperature indices in Xiongan New Area are larger than those of the
   adjacent Jing-Jin-Ji and North China regional mean. These results could
   provide valuable information for policymakers, city planners, engineers,
   and migrants to this new area.},

Abstract = {Comprehensive chemistry-climate model experiments and observational data
   are used to show that up to half of the satellite era early springtime
   cooling trend in the Arctic lower stratosphere was caused by changing
   sea surface temperatures (SSTs). An ensemble of experiments forced only
   by changing SSTs is compared to an ensemble of experiments in which both
   the observed SSTs and chemically and radiatively active trace species
   are changing. By comparing the two ensembles, it is shown that warming
   of Indian Ocean, North Pacific, and North Atlantic SSTs and cooling of
   the tropical Pacific have strongly contributed to recent polar
   stratospheric cooling in late winter and early spring. When
   concentrations of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases are
   fixed, polar ozone concentrations show a small but robust decline due to
   changing SSTs. Ozone loss is larger in the presence of changing
   concentrations of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases. The
   stratospheric changes can be understood by examining the tropospheric
   height and heat flux anomalies generated by the anomalous SSTs. Finally,
   recent SST changes have contributed to a decrease in the frequency of
   late winter stratospheric sudden warmings.},

Abstract = {This research examines the relation between temperature trends and
   vegetation change in Las Vegas. A temperature time series is modeled as
   a superposition of a linear trend and an annual cycle. The model is used
   to estimate the multi-annual temperature rate of change, which is
   related to changes in vegetation cover. The change in vegetation cover
   is estimated using an annual average normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI). The model reveals a general trend of decreasing
   temperature in Las Vegas from 2000 to 2010. This decrease is less than
   0.2 Kelvin per year (K/yr) in older housing developments; however, areas
   developed during the past decade (North Las Vegas and Southern
   Highlands) exhibit a decrease of greater than 0.2 K/yr. This temperature
   change has a correlation of -0.655 with changes in the annual average
   NDVI. Results reveal that in an arid environment, new housing
   developments that have an increase in vegetation have a cooling affect.
   The long-term trend reveals a warming trend. This research provides a
   useful insight into the effect of NDVI on temperature trends in Las
   Vegas.},

Abstract = {In this work, the trends of six climate indices based on the daily
   maximum and minimum temperatures during the period 1949-2009 at 15
   stations distributed across Serbia were analysed. The results showed
   seasonal changes in the minimum and maximum temperature extremes. An
   analysis of the extreme temperature indices suggested that the Serbian
   climate generally tended to become warmer in the last 61 years. The most
   significant temperature trends were revealed for the summer season. The
   influence of large-scale variables on the temperature was examined by
   means of the empirical orthogonal function and correlation. It was found
   that the East Atlantic pattern dominated during the winter, spring and
   summer, while the East Atlantic/West Russia pattern governed during the
   autumn. In addition, the North Atlantic Oscillation dominated the
   Serbian extreme temperature variability during the winter.},

Abstract = {Temperature in the Eastern China Seas (ECS), including the Bohai,
   Yellow, and East China seas, is crucially important with regard to
   weather forecasting and fishery activities of adjacent countries.
   Although sea surface temperature (SST) in the ECS has demonstrated a
   dramatically accelerated trend of warming after a regime shift
   (1976-1996), trends beneath the surface remain poorly understood because
   of the sparsity of observations. This study used in situ hydrographic
   data from 1976 to 1996 to examine upper-ocean temperature trends in the
   ECS. It was found that the multilevel trends show consistency with that
   of the surface water; i.e., warming is faster in winter than summer.
   However, the magnitudes of the trends weaken with increasing depth.
   Furthermore, the seasonal difference in the upper ocean is mainly
   associated with the warm currents in the ECS, which implies an essential
   contribution from horizontal advection. These phenomena could also be
   detected from data acquired from the routinely observed PN and 34
   degrees N sections. The spatiotemporal patterns of temperature trends in
   the upper ECS extend our understanding beyond the SST, especially
   highlighting the role of ocean dynamics in forming temperature patterns
   beneath the surface in comparison with atmospheric effects.},

Abstract = {Understanding the role of coupled solar and internal ocean dynamics on
   hemispheric climate variability is critical to climate modelling. We
   have analysed here 165 year long annual northern hemispheric (NH) and
   southern hemispheric (SH) sea surface temperature (SST) data employing
   spectral and statistical techniques to identify the imprints of solar
   and ocean-atmospheric processes, if any. We reconstructed the eigen
   modes of NH-SST and SH-SST to reveal non-linear oscillations
   superimposed on the monotonic trend. Our analysis reveals that the first
   eigen mode of NH-SST and SH-SST representing long-term trend of SST
   variability accounts for similar to 15-23\% variance. Interestingly,
   these components are matching with first eigen mode (99\% variance) of
   the total solar irradiance (TSI) suggesting possible impact of solar
   activity on long-term SST variation. Furthermore, spectral analysis of
   SSA reconstructed signal revealed statistically significant
   periodicities of similar to 63 +/- 5, 22 +/- 2, 10 +/- 1, 7.6, 6.3, 5.2,
   4.7, and 4.2 years in both NH-SST and SH-SST data. The major harmonics
   centred at similar to 63 +/- 5, 22 +/- 2, and 10 +/- 1 years are similar
   to solar periodicities and hence may represent solar forcing, while the
   components peaking at around 7.6, 6.3, 5.2, 4.7, and 4.2 years
   apparently falls in the frequency bands of El-Nino-Southern Oscillations
   linked to the oceanic internal processes. Our analyses also suggest
   evidence for the amplitude modulation of similar to 9-11 and similar to
   21-22 year solar cycles, respectively, by 104 and 163 years in northern
   and southern hemispheric SST data. The absence of the above periodic
   oscillations in CO2 fails to suggest its role on observed
   inter-hemispheric SST difference. The cross-plot analysis also revealed
   strong influence of solar activity on linear trend of NH- and SH-SST in
   addition to small contribution from CO2. Our study concludes that (1)
   the long-term trends in northern and southern hemispheric SST
   variability show considerable synchronicity with cyclic warming and
   cooling phases and (2) the difference in cyclic forcing and non-linear
   modulations stemming from solar variability as a possible source of
   hemispheric SST differences.},

Abstract = {A considerable funds is spent for the roads maintenance in large areas
   during the winter. The road maintenance is significantly affected by the
   temperature change of the road structure. In remote locations may occur
   a situation, when it is not clear whether the sanding is actually needed
   because the lack of information on road conditions. In these cases, the
   actual road conditions are investigated by a personal inspection or by
   sending out a gritting vehicle. Here, however, is a risk of unnecessary
   trip the sanding vehicle. This situation is economically and
   environmentally unfavorable. The proposed system solves the problem of
   measuring the temperature profile of the road and the utilization of the
   predictive model to determine the future development trend of
   temperature. The system was technically designed as a set of sensors to
   monitor environmental values such as the temperature of the road,
   ambient temperature, relative air humidity, solar radiation and
   atmospheric pressure at the measuring point. An important part of the
   proposal is prediction model which based on the inputs from sensors and
   historical measurements can, with some probability, predict temperature
   trends at the measuring point. The proposed system addresses the
   economic and environmental aspects of winter road maintenance.},

Abstract = {In this note, new evidence is provided confirming that global
   temperature series spanning back to the mid-1800s have statistically
   significant positive trends. Although there is a growing consensus that
   global temperatures are on the rise systematically, some recent studies
   have pointed out that strong serial correlation (or a unit root) in
   global temperature data could, in theory, generate spurious evidence of
   a significant positive trend. In other words, strong serially correlated
   data can mimic trending behavior over fixed periods of time. A
   serial-correlation-robust trend test recently was proposed that controls
   for the possibility of spurious evidence due to strong serial
   correlation. This new test is valid whether the errors are stationary or
   have a unit root (strong serial correlation). This test also has the
   attractive feature that it does not require estimates of serial
   correlation nuisance parameters. The test is applied to six annual
   global temperature series, and it provides strong evidence that global
   temperature series have positive trends that are statistically
   significant even when controlling for the possibility of strong serial
   correlation. The point estimates of the rate of increase in the trend
   suggest that temperatures have risen about 0.5 degreesC (1.0 degreesF)
   100 yr(-1). If the analysis is restricted to twentieth-century data,
   many of the point estimates are closer to 0.6 degreesC.},

Title = {Multicomponent pool fires: Trends in burning rate, flame height, and
   flame temperature},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {284},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The composition of a multicomponent pool fire will vary over the course
   of burning due to preferential distillation of more volatile compounds.
   As a result, key fire properties like the burning rate, flame
   temperature, flame height, and soot emissions will change as the
   properties of the fuel change. This adds uncertainty about the
   combustion properties of the fire, especially for fuel blends with
   widely varying boiling points (e.g., gasoline-ethanol). The heat release
   rate, which is proportional to the burning rate, is essential for
   estimating the radiative flux to nearby structures or personnel, so
   understanding how fire dynamics are impacted by the composition of a
   fuel mixture is a pre-requisite for dealing with hazard assessments of
   fire scenarios involving multicomponent fuels. Continuously fed pool
   fire experiments were conducted in a 0.30 m diameter pan with binary
   mixtures of ethanol-water, ethanol-isopropanol, and ethanol-hexane. The
   relationship between burning rate and fuel composition was strongly
   dependent on vapour-liquid equilibria and relative volatility of the
   mixture. It was found that burning rate models dependent on fuel
   properties gave better predictions of the relationship between burning
   rate and fuel composition. Heskestad's flame height and flame
   temperature correlations were found to be suitable for use in
   multicomponent pool fire scenarios.},

Abstract = {CSEOF analysis is conducted on the daily mean, maximum, and minimum
   temperatures measured at 60 Korea Meteorological Administration stations
   in the period of 1979-2014. Each PC time series is detrended and fitted
   to an autoregressive (AR) model. The resulting AR models are used to
   generate 100 sets of synthetic PC time series for the period of
   1979-2064, and the linear trends are added back to the resulting PC time
   series. Then, 100 sets of synthetic daily temperatures are produced by
   using the synthetic PC time series together with the The cyclostationary
   EOF (CSEOF) loading vectors. The statistics of the synthetic daily
   temperatures are similar to those of the original data during the
   observational period (1979-2064). Based on the synthetic datasets,
   future statistics including distribution of extreme temperatures and the
   length of four seasons have been analyzed. Average daily temperature in
   spring is expected to decrease by a small amount, whereas average
   temperatures in summer, fall and winter are expected to increase.
   Standard deviation of daily temperatures is expected to increase in all
   four seasons. The Generalized Extreme Value and Generalized Pareto
   distributions of extreme temperatures indicate that both warm and cold
   extremes are likely to increase in summer, while only warm extremes are
   predicted to increase significantly in winter. Thus, heat waves will
   increase and cold waves will decrease in number in future. Spring and
   fall will be shorter, whereas summer and winter will be longer. A
   statistical prediction carried out in the present study may serve as a
   baseline solution for numerical predictions using complex models.},

Abstract = {Detecting trends in climate is important in assessments of global change
   based on regional long-term data. Equally important is the reliability
   of the results that are widely used as a major input for a large number
   of societal design and planning purposes. New Zealand provides a rare
   long temperature time series in the Southern Hemisphere, and it is one
   of the longest continuous climate series available in the Southern
   Hemisphere Pacific. It is therefore important that this temperature
   dataset meets the highest quality control standards. New Zealand's
   national record for the period 1909 to 2009 is analysed and the data
   homogenized. Current New Zealand century-long climatology based on 1981
   methods produces a trend of 0.91 A degrees C per century. Our analysis,
   which uses updated measurement techniques and corrects for
   shelter-contaminated data, produces a trend of 0.28 A degrees C per
   century.},

   specific seasonal responses. While the Milankovitch forcing increased
   the millennial seasonal spread, and solar variability and volcanism
   proved ancillary in reducing the spread on the centennial timescale, the
   anthropogenic factors appear the primary agents to attenuate the
   seasonal spread. The climatic effect of the anthropogenic factors is
   amplified by seasonally varying feedbacks related to the albedo of
   changing sea-ice and snow cover.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {85},

Abstract = {The absence of continuous long term meteorological dataset has led to
   limited knowledge of glaciers' response to climate change over
   Himalayas. This study presents an open source long term temperature
   dataset Climatic Research Unit (CRU) available since 1901 to study trend
   analysis of temperature (T-max,T- T-min and T-mean) for Gangotri basin
   in Himalayas. The study first establishes close agreement between CRU
   time series data and observed temperature dataset available from
   National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), Roorkee for a period of 11 years
   from 2005 to 2015 using standard anomaly, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank (WSR) and
   correlation tests. The close agreement of CRU with NIH data validate the
   use of CRU time series to study variation in meteorological parameter
   for hilly terrain of Himalayas. The second part includes application of
   different statistical tests such as Mann-Kendall (MK), Sen's slope and
   CUSUM technique on CRU data to detect existence of any possible trends
   and identification of change points in T-max,T- T-min and T-mean on long
   term scale. On annual scale, significant increasing trends for T-mean
   and T-min were observed with no significant trend for T-max. On seasonal
   and monthly scale, T-max showed significant decreasing trend for monsoon
   season and increasing trend for winters while T-min show significant
   increasing trend for all months (except May) and seasons. CUSUM
   technique identified 8 change points from 3 annual time series with 2
   for T-mean (1974 and 1999), 3 each for T-max (1941, 1975 and 1999) and
   T-min (1941, 1965 and 1999) respectively. Overall, significant increase
   in T-max with no significant trend for T-max has been identified over
   the study area.},

Title = {Radiative and dynamical contributions to past and future Arctic
   stratospheric temperature trends},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1679-1688},
Abstract = {Arctic stratospheric ozone depletion is closely linked to the occurrence
   of low stratospheric temperatures. There are indications that cold
   winters in the Arctic stratosphere have been getting colder, raising the
   question if and to what extent a cooling of the Arctic stratosphere may
   continue into the future. We use meteorological reanalyses from the
   European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim
   and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and
   Applications (MERRA) for the past 32 yr together with calculations of
   the chemistry-climate model (CCM) ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry
   (EMAC) and models from the Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal)
   project to infer radiative and dynamical contributions to long-term
   Arctic stratospheric temperature changes. For the past three decades the
   reanalyses show a warming trend in winter and cooling trend in spring
   and summer, which agree well with trends from the Radiosonde Innovation
   Composite Homogenization (RICH) adjusted radiosonde data set. Changes in
   winter and spring are caused by a corresponding change of planetary wave
   activity with increases in winter and decreases in spring. During winter
   the increase of planetary wave activity is counteracted by a residual
   radiatively induced cooling. Stratospheric radiatively induced cooling
   is detected throughout all seasons, being highly significant in spring
   and summer. This means that for a given dynamical situation, according
   to ERA-Interim the annual mean temperature of the Arctic lower
   stratosphere has been cooling by -0.41 +/- 0.11K decade(-1) at 50 hPa
   over the past 32 yr. Calculations with state-of-the-art models from
   CCMVal and the EMAC model qualitatively reproduce the radiatively
   induced cooling for the past decades, but underestimate the amount of
   radiatively induced cooling deduced from reanalyses. There are
   indications that this discrepancy could be partly related to a possible
   underestimation of past Arctic ozone trends in the models. The models
   project a continued cooling of the Arctic stratosphere over the coming
   decades (2001-2049) that is for the annual mean about 40\% less than the
   modeled cooling for the past, due to the reduction of ozone depleting
   substances and the resulting ozone recovery. This projected cooling in
   turn could offset between 15 and 40\% of the Arctic ozone recovery.},

Year = {2002},

Abstract = {Observed (1895-1999) trends in climatic moisture conditions in the
   conterminous United States (US) characterized by (1) annual
   precipitation minus annual potential evapotranspiration (PMPE), (2)
   annual surplus (water that eventually becomes streamflow), and (3)
   annual deficit (the amount of water that must be supplied by irrigation
   to grow vegetation at an optimum rate) are examined. The sensitivity of
   moisture conditions across the conterminous US to increases in
   temperature also are examined. Results indicate that there have been
   statistically significant trends in PMPE, annual surplus, and annual
   deficit for some parts of the conterminous US. Most of the significant
   trends in PMPE have been increasing trends primarily in the eastern US.
   Annual surplus also has increased over the eastern US, whereas the
   magnitudes of annual deficit have decreased. For the conterminous US as
   a whole, there has been a statistically significant increase in PMPE and
   annual surplus; however, there is no significant trend in annual
   deficit. Results also indicate that PMPE and annual deficit in the
   warmest regions of the conterminous US are most sensitive to increases
   in temperature. The high sensitivity of PMPE and annual deficit in these
   regions to increases in temperature is related to the relation between
   temperature and the saturation vapor pressure of air. The increases in
   potential evapotranspiration for a given change in temperature are
   larger for high temperatures than for low temperatures. The regions with
   the highest sensitivity of annual surplus to increases in temperature
   are the humid regions of the country. In these regions, annual surplus
   is large and increased potential evapotranspiration, resulting from
   increased temperature, has a significant effect on reducing annual
   surplus. In the dry regions of the country, annual surplus is so low
   that increases in potential evapotranspiration only result in small
   decreases in annual surplus.},

Abstract = {Temperature and salinity in Guanabara Bay were studied during the last
   eleven years and the quantification of changes in water characteristics
   is presented. The mean temperature was 25.2-degrees-C (surface) and
   23.7-degrees-C   (bottom) and no trends were discernible. As a whole,
   the Bay showed a decrease in salinity in both surface and bottom (-0.145
   S year-1, or -4.9\%).      Salinity has decreased in bottom waters and
   more rapidly in areas under greater anthropogenic influence (western
   region, -0.60 S year-1 or -21.0\%). The rates of salinity decrease were
   higher than those expected. We attribute the decrease to increased
   runoff, high sedimentation rates, and landfills and consequent
   modifications of the circulation patterns.},

Abstract = {Cooling rate at core site (Rc, degrees C/s) of hot stamping die
   components affects the life cycle in use. To achieve accurate prediction
   of Rcs of Cr-Mo-V-W steels in dependence of tungsten content (w\%),
   working temperature Ti and surface temperature Ts, we carried out
   real-time detection of the temperature of Cr-Mo-V-W steel cylinders
   cooling in quenching sand. Cr-Mo-V-W die steel with 1.5\% of tungsten
   had the highest heat conductivity in working temperature range from 200
   degrees C to 600 degrees C, and it was ascribed to tungsten reducing the
   interstitial atoms in matrix and improving the heat conductivity. A
   cooling temperature trend (CTT) model was constructed. Compared with the
   modified Fourier model, the CTT model can predict the Rc of Cr-Mo-V-W
   steels more precisely.},

Abstract = {In this research, we define extreme temperature events using a recently
   defined excess heat factor, based on the exceedance of apparent
   temperature beyond the 95th percentile along with an acclimatization
   factor, to define extreme heat events (EHE). We extend the calculation
   to assess cold and develop relative metrics to complement the absolute
   metrics, where extremeness is based on conditions relative to season. We
   thus examine extreme cold events (ECE), relative extreme heat events,
   and relative extreme cold events in addition to EHE. We present a
   climatology of these variables for North America, followed by analyses
   of trends from 1980 to 2016. While EHE and ECE are found in the core of
   summer and winter, respectively, relative events tend to have a broader
   seasonality. Trends in relative extreme heat events and EHE are upward,
   and relative extreme cold events and ECE are downward; the relative
   events are changing more rapidly than the absolute events.
   Plain Language Summary One of the most critical ways in which weather
   conditions influence the environment is through extreme temperature
   events. While excessive heat and cold conditions have been amply
   studied, events that are extreme relative to the time of year have been
   less examined. These relative events may grab fewer headlines but can
   have important impacts on the environment, agriculture, and human
   health. In this research, we present a climatology of cold and heat
   events, both absolute and relative, for North America, followed by an
   analysis how they have changed from 1980 to 2016. Results show an
   increase in heat events and decrease in cold events across most of the
   United States and Canada. More interestingly, the relative events are
   changing slightly more rapidly than the absolute events.},

Title = {Modelling impacts of atmospheric deposition and temperature on long-term
   DOC trends},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {It is increasingly recognised that widespread and substantial increases
   in Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in remote surface, and
   soil, waters in recent decades are linked to declining acid deposition.
   Effects of rising pH and declining ionic strength on DOC solubility have
   been proposed as potential dominant mechanisms. However, since DOC in
   these systems is derived mainly from recently-fixed carbon, and since
   organic matter decomposition rates are considered sensitive to
   temperature, uncertainty persists over the extent to which other drivers
   that could influence DOC production. Such potential drivers include
   fertilisation by nitrogen (N) and global warming. We therefore ran the
   dynamic soil chemistry model MADOC for a range of UK soils, for which
   time series data are available, to consider the likely relative
   importance of decreased deposition of sulphate and chloride,
   accumulation of reactive N, and higher temperatures, on soil DOC
   production in different soils. Modelled patterns of DOC change generally
   agreed favourably with measurements collated over 1020 years, but
   differed markedly between sites. While the acidifying effect of sulphur
   deposition appeared to be the predominant control on the observed soil
   water DOC trends in all the soils considered other than a blanket peat,
   the model suggested that over the long term, the effects of nitrogen
   deposition on N-limited soils may have been sufficient to raise the
   ``acid recovery DOC baseline{''} significantly. In contrast, reductions
   in non marine chloride deposition and effects of long term warming
   appeared to have been relatively unimportant. The suggestion that future
   DOC concentrations might exceed preindustrial levels as a consequence of
   nitrogen pollution has important implications for drinking water
   catchment management and the setting and pursuit of appropriate
   restoration targets, but findings still require validation from reliable
   centennial-scale proxy records, such as those being developed using
   palaeolimnological techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{[}1] The United States (U.S.) Climate Division data set is commonly
   used in applied climatic studies in the United States. The divisional
   averages are calculated by including all available stations within a
   division at any given time. The averages are therefore vulnerable to
   shifts in average station location or elevation over time, which may
   introduce spurious trends within these data. This paper examines
   temperature trends within the 15 climate divisions of New England,
   comparing the NCDC's U. S. Divisional Data to the U. S. Historical
   Climate Network (USHCN) data. Correlation and multiple regression
   revealed that shifts in latitude, longitude, and elevation have affected
   the quality of the NCDC divisional data with respect to the USHCN. As a
   result, there may be issues with regard to their use in decadal-to
   century-scale climate change studies.},

Pages = {4791-4806},
Abstract = {Warming of the deep water in the Weddell Sea has important implications
   for Antarctic bottom water formation, melting of pack ice, and the
   regional ocean-atmosphere heat transfer. In order to evaluate warming
   trends in the Weddell Sea, a historical data set encompassing CTD and
   bottle data from 1912 to 2000 was analyzed for temporal trends in the
   deep water masses: warm deep water (WDW) and Weddell Sea deep water
   (WSDW). The coldest WDW temperatures were primarily associated with the
   Weddell Polynya of the mid-1970s. Subsequent warming occurred at a rate
   of similar to0.012+/-0.007degreesCyr(-1) from the 1970s to 1990s. This
   warming was comparable to the global, average surface water warming
   observed by Levitus et al. (Science 287 (2000) 2225), to the warming of
   the WSBW in the central Weddell Sea observed by Fahrbach et al.
   (Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf Program, Report No. 12,
   Alfred-Wegener-Institut, Bremerhaven, Germany, 1998a, p.24), and to the
   surface ice temperature warming from 1970 to 1998 in the Weddell Sea
   observed by Comiso (J. Climate 13 (2000) 1674). The warming was not
   compensated by an increase in salinity, and thus the WDW became less
   dense. The location of the warmest temperature was displaced towards the
   surface by similar to200m from the 1970s to the 1990s. Although the
   average WSDW potential temperatures between 1500 and 3500m were warmer
   in the 1990s than in the 1970s, high variability in the data prevented
   identification of a well-defined temporal trend. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {PurposeInherent structural and functional properties of
   biotechnology-derived therapeutic biologics make them susceptible to
   light- and temperature-induced degradation and consequently can
   influence their quality. Photosensitivity of therapeutic proteins
   continues to be examined, but the commonalities and trends of storage
   conditions and information about light and temperature sensitivity among
   currently licensed therapeutic proteins has not been previously
   surveyed.MethodsUsing a comprehensive and relational database approach,
   we conducted a scientific survey of all licensed biotechnology-derived
   drug products with the goal of providing evidence-based information
   about recommended storage conditions of formulations sorted by light-
   and temperature-related attributes as described for each product at
   licensure.ResultsWe report the prevalence of indications for light and
   temperature sensitivity in formulations categorized by their
   presentation type, number of doses, container type, dosage form and
   active molecule type. We also report the storage temperature range
   across formulations and diluents for reconstitution and dilution.
   Formulations with excipients that potentially facilitate light-induced
   and thermal degradation were also noted.ConclusionsThe result of our
   analysis indicates that light and temperature sensitivity are prevalent
   across therapeutic protein formulations. However, when a formulation is
   reconstituted or diluted, both light and temperature sensitivity are
   less clear. In addition, light and temperature sensitivity are more well
   defined in liquid formulations than lyophilized powder formulations, and
   more well defined in products manufactured in autoinjectors,
   prefilled-syringes, and pens than products in vials. Overall, our report
   provides a data-driven summary of storage conditions among therapeutic
   protein formulations to support the development of future biologic drug
   products.},

Title = {Seasonal trend analysis of minimum air temperature in La Plata river

Abstract = {Regional economies that depend predominantly on agriculture and
   livestock are heavily affected by changes in air temperature, one such
   case are the activities in La Plata river basin (LPB). Some studies
   suggest that variations in the seasonal cycle and season onset would
   affect efficiency in the use of radiation by vegetation. This paper
   evaluates the distribution of minimum temperature seasonality trends
   over LPB, describes the trends in the seasonal cycle, and detects
   changes of minimum temperature extremes characterized by the number of
   frost days and the frequency of warm and cold nights. The analysis
   includes absolute minimum temperature (TnMin) and minimum average
   temperature (TnMean) from ERA5 reanalysis for the 1980-2015 period.
   Significant positive trends in the amplitude of annual average TnMin and
   TnMean are observed over more than half the area (53.5\% and 69.9\% of
   the basin, respectively). Amplitude and phase parameters suggest that
   average minimum temperature underwent greater variation than absolute
   minimum temperature over LPB. The shifts in phase indicate that minimum
   temperatures occurred earlier than usual in the year considering the
   35-year series. In general terms, there is a shift toward warmer
   conditions. This warming is evident in seasonal trends of minimum
   temperature as well as in the significant increase in the number of warm
   nights, a significant decrease of cold days and a significant decrease
   in the number of frost days in the highest Andes mountains in the west
   of the LPB.},

Journal = {NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {Air temperature trends (1960-2009) based on stations in cities, minus
   those based on global surface temperature datasets, are defined herein
   as urban heat island (UHI) trends. Urban climate was examined globally
   by comparing UHI trends with indices of geophysical factors, including
   background climate, latitude, and diurnal temperature range (DTR) and
   indices of artificial factors, including anthropogenic heat emission
   (AHE) and population indices. Surprisingly, a better relationship was
   found between UHI trends and DTR-an integrated geophysical index
   representing thermal inertia-than with the indices of artificial
   factors. Thus, while an increase in sensible heat (mechanism 1) triggers
   UHI formation, this study infers that large thermal inertia (mechanism
   2) contributes significantly on UHI. The correlation of UHI trends with
   other indices can be explained by both mechanisms.},

Title = {Modelled and observed sea surface temperature trends for the Caribbean
   and Antilles},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1873-1886},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {The ocean occupies 95\% of the Caribbean's area and plays a leading role
   in the region's climate, thus making the sea surface temperature (SST) a
   very important regional climate index. This, in conjunction with the
   lack of a regionally consistent, quality-controlled surface temperature
   dataset increases the scientific value of using SST to characterize the
   regional climate and its trends. This study determines the magnitudes of
   the long-term SST trends in the Wider Caribbean (WC) and the Antilles.
   We overcome the presence of discontinuity points in the SST time series
   using the change point statistical technique. Annual mean SST trends
   combining the subperiods 1906-1969 and 1972-2005 are 1.32 +/- 0.41
   degrees C per century for the Antilles and 1.08 +/- 0.32 degrees C per
   century for the WC. For the same regions during the subperiod 1972-2005,
   the corresponding trends are 1.41 +/- 0.68 degrees C per century and
   1.18 +/- 0.49 degrees C per century, illustrating the warming
   intensification during the last four decades. A significant correlation
   is found between the SSTs in the Caribbean and Atlantic Multidecadal
   Oscillation (AMO) index, suggesting a potential link between Caribbean
   SSTs and the mechanisms governing the Atlantic basin-wide SSTs. Finally,
   the capabilities of two state-of-the-art coupled climate models, the
   Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1-M) and the Bergen Climate Model
   (BCM), to simulate SST in the Caribbean were tested. Both models produce
   an adequate simulation of the annual mean SST anomalies and SST seasonal
   cycle for the WC and the Antilles. The simulated annual and monthly mean
   SSTs are colder in the two models compared to the observations, a common
   feature among the majority of general circulation models participating
   in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. However, despite
   these minor deficiencies both BCM and NorESM1-M are considered adequate
   for conducting SST simulations relevant for future climate change
   research in the Caribbean.},

Abstract = {Low-frequency variability and trends in temperature from 1979 to 2012
   are examined. Observational improvements are noted and near-surface
   behaviour of the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis is reviewed. Attention is
   then focussed on how closely ERA-Interim fits the upper-air data it
   assimilates, the bias adjustments it infers for satellite data, and its
   agreement with the ERA-40, MERRA and JRA-55 reanalyses and with model
   simulations. Global-mean fits to independently homogenised radiosonde
   temperatures and variationally adjusted satellite brightness
   temperatures are mainly within 0.1 K in the troposphere, with some
   degradation over time from assimilating varying amounts of aircraft and
   rain-affected microwave-radiance data, and from a change in source of
   sea-surface-temperature analysis. Lower-tropospheric warming appears to
   be somewhat underestimated. Temperature variations in the tropical upper
   troposphere correlate well with those at the surface, but amplitude is
   more than doubled, in agreement with modelling. Specific humidity varies
   in concert; relative humidity is largely uniform, but dips during El
   Nino events. Agreement with the other reanalyses is particularly close
   in the lower stratosphere, where radiance data and the background model
   constrain cooling to be slightly slower than in the homogenised
   radiosonde data. Perturbations to global-mean temperatures from
   underestimating warming following the El Chichon and Pinatubo volcanic
   eruptions and from assimilating recent GPSRO data are at most 0.2 K,
   less than 20\% of the net change since 1979 at 50 hPa.
   Middle-stratospheric variations are more uncertain. Recent cooling
   appears to be underestimated by assimilating increasing amounts of
   unadjusted radiosonde data, but results do not support a recent
   reprocessing of earlier sounding data that suggests stronger
   middle-stratospheric cooling than previously indicated. Strong analysed
   upper-stratospheric cooling agrees quite well with model simulations if
   occasional jumps due to unadjusted bias changes in high-sounding
   satellite data are discounted. Producing ERA-Interim in two separate
   streams caused only minor discontinuities where streams join at the
   start of 1989.},

Abstract = {Results of calculations of temperature trends in the free atmosphere
   (troposphere and lower stratosphere) using the quantile regression
   apparatus are considered and analyzed. In traditional techniques used in
   climatology, trends are estimated by use of regression based on the
   least squares method. Quantile regression, in contrast to these
   techniques, makes it possible to estimate regression parameters for each
   quantile of predictand values in the quantile range from zero to one.
   Using quantile regression to estimate climate changes results in a
   detailed picture of the dependence of the climate trend on the variation
   range of meteorological parameters in the quantile range of these
   parameters from zero to one. In particular, climate trends can be
   estimated for meteorological parameter values close to extreme. This
   paper uses the global radiosonde data array from which the stations are
   selected if the completeness of their data meets the requirements
   stated. Using the radiosonde data from the selected stations, the
   dependences of climatic trends of temperature on isobaric surfaces on
   values of quantiles (so-called process diagrams), as well as vertical
   quantile cross sections of climate trend values, are calculated,
   plotted, and analyzed. For thirteen high-latitude stations in the
   Northern Hemisphere among the selected ones, temperature trends are
   estimated both using radiosonde data and based on the ERA 5/ERA 5.1
   reanalyses. An analysis of the results allows one to note the nonuniform
   character of tropospheric warming trends in the range of quantile
   variation, which is more apparent in the winter season. The nonuniform
   (for the range of quantile variation) character of tropospheric
   temperature trends is due to the fact that the tropospheric warming rate
   in the ``cold{''} part of the quantile range is higher than that in its
   ``warm{''} part. This agrees with the results obtained previously by
   analysis of surface temperature trends using the quantile regression
   method (QRM). The nonuniform character of cooling trends in the lower
   stratosphere is noted for the range of quantile variations. In winter
   and, to a lesser extent, in spring, the rate of stratospheric cooling
   decreases in absolute magnitude with an increase in quantile values at
   some stations in northern latitudes. Moreover, for the quantiles close
   to 1.0, negative trends can change sign. This can be both due to
   incomplete data on lower stratospheric temperature, which is
   particularly inherent in the high-latitude regions of the Northern
   Hemisphere, and due to the influence of more frequently occurring sudden
   stratospheric warmings (SSWs) on the temperature trend structure that is
   detailed within the range of quantile values. In is noted that the
   detailed structures of climate temperature trends that are obtained on
   the basis of radiosonde data proved to be very similar to those obtained
   based on arrays of ERA 5/ERA 5.1 reanalysis.},

Abstract = {Incoherent scatter radar measurements of ionospheric temperature and
   density collected above Millstone Hill over the years 1976-2013 are
   analyzed to show the long-term trends in noontime neutral temperature
   and neutral O density over the height region 120-500 km. Exospheric
   temperature cooled by 69.3 +/- 6.4 K over the period, an order of
   magnitude greater than that expected from greenhouse gas action. The O
   density dropped 0.081 +/- 5.6\% at 400 km altitude but rose by 36.9 +/-
   5.0\% at 120 km over this period. This trend in density at 400 km agrees
   with that determined from satellite drag. The increase in density at 120
   km counteracts the thermal contraction of the thermosphere expected to
   be associated with the cooling, resulting in only a small density
   response at 400 km. The long-term O density increase at 120 km may be
   caused by a long-term descent of the turbopause height of 4.2 km. Such a
   descent has been documented by a series of rocket mass spectrometer
   measurements.},

Abstract = {Two millennia-length juniper ring width chronologies, processed to
   preserve multi-centennial growth trends, are presented for the Alai
   Range of the western Tien Shan in Kirghizia. The chronologies average
   the information from seven near-timberline sampling sites, and likely
   reflect summer temperature variation. For comparison, chronologies are
   also built using standard dendrochronological techniques. We briefly
   discuss some qualities of these ``inter-decadal{''} records, and show
   the low frequency components removed by the standardization process
   include a long-term negative trend in the first half of the last
   millennium and a long-term positive trend since about AD 1800. The
   multi-centennial scale Alai Range chronologies, where these trends are
   retained, are both systematically biased (but in an opposite sense) in
   their low frequency domains. Nevertheless, they represent the best
   constraints and estimates of long-term summer temperature variation, and
   reflect the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, and a period of
   warming since about the middle of the nineteenth century.},

Abstract = {Temporal variation in the absolute value of interdiurnal variability
   (AIDV) of January maximum temperatures is examined for the period
   1945-1985 in the central United States (90 degrees -105 degreesW). AIDV;
   indicates the magnitude of day-to-day changes in the maximum
   temperature. Five-year running-mean AIDV values decreased significantly
   throughout the period. This trend was apparent for the region overall
   and for 10 of the 10 study sites analyzed individually Temporal
   variation in AIDV values was significantly related to mid-tropospheric
   flow patterns over the central United States. Meridional circulation was
   associated with smaller AIDV values in all sites except those in the
   northwestern and southeastern corners of the study area, whereas zonal
   flow was linked to larger interdiurnal temperature change. The analysis
   of selected individual veers indicated that mid-tropospheric circulation
   patterns were more persistent with meridional flea: and surface cyclones
   and their associated surface fronts tracked through the study area less
   frequently than in years with zonal flow. Analysis at a daily temporal
   resolution revealed an added dimension of trends in temperature
   variability beyond those apparent with a coarser monthly resolution.
   These results emphasize the importance of finer temporal resolution in
   the analysis of both past and projected climate change; regionally
   summarized monthly temperature values mask important variation in
   temperature trends apparent at shorter temporal and more local spatial
   scales.},

Abstract = {A model to account for the composition dependence and shape of the
   relaxation spectra of miscible blends in the glass transition zone is
   applied to dielectric measurements on tetramethyl-Bisphenol A
   polycarbonate (TMPC) mixed with polystyrene (PS). The shape of the
   dispersion associated with segmental relaxation is governed primarily by
   the fluctuations in the degree of cooperativity associated with the
   distribution in local composition arising from concentration
   fluctuations. A blend of fixed composition possesses a distribution of
   local environments; these effect a distribution in the degree of
   cooperativity of the segmental relaxation of locally rearranging chain
   units. Pure PS has a lower T(g) than TMPC. Hence, in the blend before
   cooperative dynamics is considered, PS chains will tend to have
   segmentally relaxed when segmental relaxation of TMPC is considered. The
   dynamical constraints imposed by PS segments in a local environment of
   TMPC are thus mitigated, allowing TMPC segmental relaxation to proceed
   with a lower degree of intermolecular cooperativity than is the case in
   less PS-rich environments. The temperature dependence of the
   frequency-temperature shift factors for the blend are governed by the
   degree of intermolecular cooperativity of the segmental relaxation.
   Hence, there exists a direct and verifiable relation between frequency
   and temperature dependencies of the mixture. The present data on
   TMPC/PS, though not sufficient to entirely demonstrate such a
   relationship, are nevertheless consistent with the predicted relation.},

Abstract = {Oceans play a key role in energy storage in the global

   past evolution and future trends of sea surface temperature is crucial

   role of sea surface temperature as an important ingredient for the
   development and/or intensification of heavy precipitation events in the
   Western Mediterranean basin but have also highlighted its role in heat
   waves in Europe. In this study, a consistent warming trend has been
   found for daily sea surface temperature data series derived from
   satellites (1982-2016) for the whole Mediterranean region and for
   different temporal scales, from daily to monthly, seasonal and decadal
   estimates. Additionally, spatial clustering analysis has been run to
   look for its spatial structure. Two main distribution modes have been
   found for sea surface temperature in winter and summer, while spring and
   fall show transitional regimes. Winter mode shows a north-to-south
   increasing gradient banded structure while summer regime presents a set

Pages = {429-442},
Abstract = {This study estimated the trends in the number of days that fall within
   the near-zero (0 degrees C) range of the temperature continuum. This
   narrow range has importance for potential transportation hazards and
   freeze-thaw cycles. While the tails of the air-temperature distribution
   and their trends often are closely examined under the climate change
   context, the frequency and trend of other portions of the
   air-temperature distribution can be equally important, as many societal
   impacts are caused by events in the non-tail region, such as near-zero
   degrees C temperatures (NZT). Examining the trend of the number of NZT
   days over the conterminous USA for the period of 1948-1949 through
   2010-2011, we found three distinct spatial clusters. The most
   distinctive spatial clusters are found along the West Coast (positive
   temperature trends leading to a decrease in NZT days), the High Plains
   and Northern Rockies (positive temperature trends leading to an increase
   in NZT days), and the southeastern USA (negative temperature trends
   leading to an increase in NZT days). While trends in the number of NZT
   days are linked to changes in mean minimum air temperature, increasing
   minimum temperature leads to a positive trend at NZT days only at some
   locations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Recent analyses of long-term time series of ion temperature from two
   midlatitude incoherent-scatter radars have revealed very strong cooling,
   which is substantially greater than predicted by models for neutral
   temperature. There is also an indication that the cooling has
   substantially accelerated after a breakpoint around 1979 when the ozone
   hole was discovered. This has prompted a hypothesis that the accelerated
   cooling might have resulted from the ozone depletion and associated
   reduction in daytime radiative heating in the stratosphere. A lively
   discussion on relative roles of different cooling mechanisms has
   followed. The purpose of this note is to contribute to this discussion
   from a theoretical and modeling perspective. In particular, a possible
   misinterpretation of the modeling results behind the ozone hypothesis is
   clarified. It is also shown that model predictions of neutral
   temperature trends in the thermosphere agree well with, and hence are
   tightly constrained by, independent observations including trends in
   heights of ionospheric layers and in neutral density from satellite
   drag. However, they are up to an order of magnitude smaller than the
   observational estimates of trends in ion temperature. These widely
   different results cannot be quantitatively reconciled regardless of what
   known cooling mechanisms are invoked. This stark discrepancy should be
   addressed on the data analysis and theoretical fronts. Citation: Akmaev,

Title = {Half-century air temperature change above Antarctica: Observed trends
   and spatial reconstructions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {This study provides a comprehensive analysis of observed 50-year
   (1961-2010) seasonal air temperature trends from radiosonde ascents
   above Antarctica. Comparisons between multiple radiosonde data sets
   (homogenized in different ways) at each of eight Antarctic stations
   reveals substantial differences in the upper-air temperature trend
   magnitudes and their statistical significance between data sets.
   However, when considering the average of these data sets at each
   station, or averaging across all stations, a robust vertical profile of
   half-century temperature change emerges, characterized by
   mid-tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. Statistically
   significant Multistation-mean 500 hPa warming (0.1 to 0.2 degrees C
   decade(-1)) is found in all seasons, whereas the lower stratospheric
   cooling has been manifest primarily in austral spring and summer, but
   with larger magnitudes (-1.0 to -2.0 degrees C decade(-1)). We undertake
   the first spatial reconstructions of pan-Antarctic upper-air temperature
   trends. They strongly suggest that both the year-round mid-tropospheric
   warming and spring and summer lower stratospheric cooling have occurred
   above the entire continent, although their magnitudes and significance
   vary regionally. The reconstructed 500 hPa warming trends in winter and
   spring are largest over West Antarctica, the Ross Ice shelf, Victoria
   Land and Oates Land, and show close resemblance to those found in
   previously published surface temperature trend reconstructions,
   suggesting coupling between the surface and trends aloft. We speculate
   that the winter and spring mid-tropospheric warming may, in part, be
   driven by tropical ocean warming, analogous to proposed mechanisms for
   the co-located surface warming. The spring and summer lower
   stratospheric cooling is entirely consistent with the temperature
   response to ozone depletion.},

Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {29-41},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables in the
   context of changing climate, particularly in countries where rainfed
   agriculture is predominant, is vital to assess climate-induced changes
   and suggest feasible adaptation strategies. To that end, trend analysis
   has been employed to inspect the change of rainfall and temperature in
   northcentral Ethiopia using gridded monthly precipitation data obtained
   from Global Precipitation and Climate Centre (GPCC V7) and temperature
   data from Climate Research Unit (CRU TS 3.23) with 0.5 degrees by 0.5
   degrees resolution from 1901 to 2014. Data have been analyzed using
   coefficient of variation, anomaly index, precipitation concentration
   index and Palmer drought severity index. Furthermore, Mann-Kendall test
   was used to detect the time series trend. The result revealed intra-and
   inter-annual variability of rainfall while Palmer drought severity index
   value proved the increasing trend of the number of drought years.
   Annual, belg and kiremt rainfall have decreased with a rate of 15.03,
   1.93 and 13.12mm per decade respectively. The declining trend for annual
   and kiremt rainfall was found to be statistically significant while that
   of belg was not significant. The rate of change of temperature was found
   to be 0.046, 0.067 and 0.026 degrees C per decade for mean, minimum and
   maximum respectively. The Mann-Kendall trend analysis test result
   revealed increasing trend for mean and minimum average temperatures
   through time significantly while the trend for maximum temperature
   exhibited a non-significant increasing trend. We recommend strategies
   designed in the agricultural sector have to take the declining and
   erratic nature of rainfall and increasing trend of temperature into
   consideration.},

Abstract = {In Morocco, socio-economic activities are highly vulnerable to extreme
   weather events. This study investigates trends in mean and extreme
   rainfall, run-off and temperature, as well as their relationship with
   large-scale atmospheric circulation. It focuses on two Moroccan
   watersheds: the subhumid climate region of Bouregreg in the north and
   the semiarid region of Tensift in the south, using data from 1977 to
   2003. The study is based on a set of daily temperature, precipitation
   and run-off time series retrieved from weather stations in the two
   regions. Results do not show a homogeneous behaviour in the two
   catchments; the influence of the large-scale atmospheric circulation is
   different and a clear spatial dependence of the trend analysis linked to
   the distance from the coast and the mountains can be observed. Overall,
   temperature trends are mostly positive in the studied area, while weak
   statistically significant trends can be identified in seasonal rainfall,
   extreme rainfall events, average run-off and extreme run-off events.},

Abstract = {The increase of water demand in various sectors has led to a growing
   freshwater shortage in many parts of the world, including India. Growing
   mismanagement of available water resources and changing climatic
   conditions are accelerating the disparity between water supply and water
   demand. Consequently, ensuring water security and food security is one
   of the greatest sustainability challenges of the twenty-first century.
   To address this challenge, this study focuses on the spatio-temporal
   variability and long-term trend analysis of two major climatic
   variables, viz., rainfall and temperature time series obtained from 14
   weather stations situated in a sub-tropical region of Eastern India. For
   the trend analysis, three well-known statistical tests were used. It was
   found that both the spatial and temporal variations in annual rainfall
   and monthly temperatures (T-max, T-min and T-mean) are statistically
   significant at 1\% level of significance. The analysis of trends in the
   annual rainfall time series revealed significant increasing trends of
   18.98 and 20.61 mm per year at Burdwan-I and Mejhiastations,
   respectively, and ``no trend{''} at the remaining weather stations.
   However, significant decreasing trends ranging from - 0.022 to - 0.064
   degrees C per year were found in the maximum temperature (T-max) time
   series of July, September, October, and November. In contrast,
   significant increasing trends varying from 0.023 to 0.03 degrees C per
   year were identified in the minimum temperature (T-min) time series of
   May at most stations. The results of this study have direct implications
   for climate change impacts in the region. The findings of this study can
   help formulate climate-resilient and adaptive strategies for the
   effective planning and management of water resources to sustain
   agricultural productivity, the environment and livelihoods in the
   region.},

   Sipi Sub-Catchment on the Slopes of Mt. Elgon, Uganda},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The variabilities in rainfall and temperature in a catchment affect
   water availability and sustainability. This study assessed the
   variabilities in rainfall and temperature (1981-2015) and river flow
   (1998-2015) in the Sipi sub-catchment on annual and seasonal scales.
   Observed daily rainfall and temperature data for Buginyanya and
   Kapchorwa weather stations were obtained from the Uganda National
   Meteorological Authority (UNMA), while the daily river-flow data for
   Sipi were obtained from the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE). The
   study used descriptive statistics, the Standardized Precipitation Index
   (SPI), Mann-Kendall trend analysis, and Sen's slope estimator. Results
   indicate a high coefficient of variation (CV) (CV > 30) for August,
   September, October, and November (ASON) seasonal rainfall, while annual
   rainfall had a moderate coefficient of variation (20 < CV < 30). The
   trend analysis shows that ASON minimum and mean temperatures increased
   at alpha = 0.001 and alpha = 0.05 levels of significance respectively in
   both stations and over the entire catchment. Furthermore, annual and
   March, April, and May (MAM) river flows increased at an alpha = 0.05
   level of significance. A total of 14 extremely wet and dry events
   occurred in the sub-catchment during the post-2000 period, as compared
   to five in the pre-2000. The significant increased trend of river flow
   could be attributed to the impacts of climate and land-use changes.
   Therefore, future studies may need to quantify the impacts of future
   climate and land-use changes on water resources in the sub-catchment.},

Title = {Innovative trend analysis of annual and seasonal air temperature and

Abstract = {The variation characteristics of air temperature and precipitation in
   the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), China during 1960-2015 were analysed
   using a linear regression (LR) analysis, a Mann-Kendall (MK) test with
   Sen's slope estimator and Sen's innovative trend analysis (ITA). The
   results showed that the annual maximum, minimum and mean temperature
   significantly increased at the rate of 0.15 degrees C/10yr, 0.23 degrees
   C/10yr and 0.19 degrees C/10yr, respectively, over the whole study area
   during 1960-2015. The warming magnitudes for the above variables during
   1980-2015 were much higher than those during 1960-2015:0.38 degrees
   C/10yr, 0.35 degrees C/10yr and 0.36 degrees C/10yr, respectively. The
   seasonal maximum, minimum and mean temperature significantly increased
   in the spring, autumn and winter seasons during 1960-2015. Although the
   summer temperatures also increased at some extent, only the minimum
   temperature showed a significant increasing trend. Meanwhile, the
   highest rate of increase of seasonal mean temperature occurred in winter
   (0.24 degrees C/10yr) during 1960-2015 and spring (0.50 degrees C/10yr)
   during 1980-2015, which indicated that the significant warming trend for
   the whole YRB could be attributed to the remarkable temperature
   increases in winter and spring months. However, both the annual and
   seasonal warming magnitudes showed large regional differences, and a
   higher warming rate was detected in the eastern YRB and the western
   source region of the Yangtze River on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).
   Additionally, annual precipitation increased by approximately 12.02
   mm/10yr during 1960-2015 but decreased at the rate of 19.63 mm/10yr
   during 1980-2015. There were decreasing trends for precipitation in all
   four seasons since 1980 in the YRB, and a significant increasing trend
   was only detected in summer since 1960 (12.37 mm/10yr). Overall, a
   warming wetting trend was detected in the south-eastern and
   north-western YRB, while there was a warming-drying trend in middle
   regions.},

Title = {Assessing trends in extreme precipitation events intensity and magnitude
   using non-stationary peaks-over-threshold analysis: a case study in
   northeast Spain from 1930 to 2006},

Abstract = {Most applications of the extreme value (EV) theory have assumed
   stationarity, i.e. the statistical properties of the process do not
   change over time. However, there is evidence suggesting that the
   occurrence of extreme events is not stationary but changes naturally, as
   it has been found for many other climate variables. Of paramount
   importance for hazard analysis is whether the observed precipitation
   time series exhibit long-term trends or cycles; such information is also
   relevant in climate change studies. In this study, the theory of
   non-stationary extreme value (NSEV) analysis was applied to data series
   of daily precipitation using the peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach. A
   Poisson/generalized Pareto (P/GP) model, in which the model parameters
   were allowed to vary linearly with time, was fitted to the resulting
   series of precipitation event's intensity and magnitude. A
   log-likelihood ratio test was applied to determine the existence of
   trends in the model parameters. The method was applied to a case study
   in northeast Spain, comprising a set of 64 daily rainfall series from
   1930 to 2006. Statistical significance was achieved in less than 5\% of
   the stations using a linear non-stationary model at the annual scale,
   indicating that there is no evidence of a generalized trend in extreme
   precipitation in the study area. At the seasonal scale, however, a
   significant number of stations along the Mediterranean (Catalonia
   region) showed a significant decrease of extreme rainfall intensity in
   winter, while experiencing an increase in spring. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {Due to the lack of reliable climatic proxies, the variability of
   precipitation in ``Westerlies-dominated{''} arid central Asia (ACA)
   during the Holocene is debated. Here, we present a high-resolution (ca.
   100 years per sample) organic carbon isotopic composition (delta
   C-13(org)) record from bulk samples from the Lujiaowan10 section in the
   northern piedmont of the Tienshan Mountains, Xinjiang Province,
   northwestern China. A robust chronology is provided by K-feldspar pIRIR
   dating. During the early to middle Holocene, from 12 ka to 6 ka (1 ka =
   1000 years ago), the delta C-13(org) values are relatively invariant
   with an average of around -22.5 parts per thousand. After about 6 ka,
   the delta C-13(org) values exhibit an overall negative trend with the
   most negative value of -25.2 parts per thousand occurring in the
   uppermost part of the section, within the interval of Holocene soil
   formation. Our investigation of the relationship between modern climatic
   variables and surface soil delta C-13(org) values from the region
   reveals a significant negative correlation between surface soil delta
   C-13(org) and summer precipitation amount (June to August). Therefore,
   we used the calibration model between summer precipitation amount and
   surface soil delta C-13(org) to quantitatively reconstruct the Holocene
   summer precipitation history of the study area. Our results indicate
   that summer precipitation in the region was the lowest (ca. 85 mm)
   during the early to middle Holocene (12-6 ka); however, after 6 ka, the
   precipitation increased continuously to about 137 mm per year at the
   present. Our reconstruction is generally consistent with climate
   simulation results and with regional effective moisture records. Thus,
   we conclude that the highest summer precipitation, and therefore the
   wettest climate, occurred in the late Holocene. Decreasing Northern
   Hemisphere summer insolation may have effected a change in the CGT
   (circumglobal teleconnection) from a positive to negative phase and,
   together with more negative trends in AO (Arctic Oscillation) or NAO
   (North Atlantic Oscillation), may have been responsible for the observed
   pattern of summer precipitation evolution.},

Title = {Performance Evaluation of four Statistical Tests for Trend and

   Precipitation Series in Major United States Cities},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {In this study, the performance of four statistical tests was evaluated
   to assess the following time-series types: stationary in variance and
   trend in mean (S\_T), stationary in variance and no trend in mean
   (S\_NT), nonstationary in variance and trend in mean (NS\_T), and
   nonstationary in variance and no trend in mean (NS\_NT). The four
   statistical tests included two stationarity tests, the
   Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) and Philips and Perron (PP)
   tests, and two trend tests, the Mann-Kendall (M-K) and regression tests.
   In each case, the sample size, standard deviation for noise, and several
   parameters were randomly generated to produce 1000 samples. The four
   tests were then conducted to determine if the data were stationary or
   non-stationary with trend or without trend. The results showed that
   there are several important patterns depending on the conditions of
   Monte Carlo experiments to investigate the performances of the four
   statistical tests with the four time-series types. These tests were also
   conducted to evaluate the time-series types of the observed and
   projected annual daily maximum precipitation series in eight cities of
   the United States. Results showed that cases of S\_NT, which is the
   general assumption for the classical statistical frequency analysis,
   became less represented, while the two trend cases (NS\_T and S\_T)
   became more represented as time went on from HIST (1950-1999) to a
   representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 or RCP 8.5 (2000-2099).
   NS\_T cases in RCP 8.5 occurred more frequently than those in RCP 4.5.
   These results suggest that because of climate change, the assessment of
   time-series types should be considered when examining annual maximum
   precipitation and designing water-related infrastructure.},

Abstract = {A major Irish study, based upon more than 8000 samples collected over
   the measurement period of 22 years, for sulfur dioxide (SO2-S), sulfate
   (SO4-S) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2-N) concentrations (mu g m(-3)) within
   air, and the ionic composition of precipitation samples based on sodium
   (Na+), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl-),
   sulfate (SO4-S), non-sea salt sulfate (nssSO(4)-S), ammonium (NH4-N),
   and nitrate (NO3-N) weighted mean concentrations (mg l(-1)), has been
   completed. For the air samples, the sulfur dioxide and sulfate
   concentrations decreased over the sampling period (1980-2004) by 75\%
   and 45\%, respectively, whereas no significant trend was observed for
   nitrogen dioxide. The highest concentrations for sulfur dioxide, sulfate
   and nitrogen dioxide were associated with wind originating from the
   easterly and northeasterly directions i. e. those influenced by Irish
   and European sources. The lowest concentrations were associated with the
   westerly directions i. e. for air masses originating in the North
   Atlantic region. This was further verified with the use of backward
   (back) trajectory analysis, which allowed tracing the movement of air
   parcels using the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasting
   (ECMWF) ERA-40 re-analysis data. High non-sea salt sulfate levels were
   being associated with air masses originating from Europe (easterlies)
   with lower levels from the Atlantic (westerlies). With the precipitation
   data, analysis of the non-sea salt sulfate concentrations showed a

Abstract = {The objectives of this study were to compare dengue virus (DENV) cases,
   deaths, case-fatality ratio {[}CFR], and meteorological parameters
   between the first and the recent decades of this century (2000-2010 vs.
   2011-2022) and to describe the trends, seasonality, and impact of change
   of temperature and rainfall patterns on transmission dynamics of dengue
   in Bangladesh. For the period 2000-2022, dengue cases and death data
   from Bangladesh's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's website, and
   meteorological data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department were
   analyzed. A Poisson regression model was performed to identify the
   impact of meteorological parameters on the monthly dengue cases. A
   forecast of dengue cases was performed using an autoregressive
   integrated moving average model. Over the past 23 yr, a total of 244,246
   dengue cases were reported including 849 deaths (CFR = 0.35\%). The mean
   annual number of dengue cases increased 8 times during the second
   decade, with 2,216 cases during 2000-2010 vs. 18,321 cases during
   2011-2022. The mean annual number of deaths doubled (21 vs. 46), but the
   overall CFR has decreased by one-third (0.69\% vs. 0.23\%).
   Concurrently, the annual mean temperature increased by 0.49 degrees C,
   and rainfall decreased by 314 mm with altered precipitation seasonality.
   Monthly mean temperature (Incidence risk ratio {[}IRR]: 1.26),
   first-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.08), and second-lagged rainfall (IRR:
   1.17) were significantly associated with monthly dengue cases. The
   increased local temperature and changes in rainfall seasonality might
   have contributed to the increased dengue cases in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {This study aims to assess the climate change impact on the rainfall and
   temperature data of the Vadodara-Chhotaudepur district of India and to
   focus on the environmental challenges related to the rainfall and
   temperature in the present state of development, land use,
   industrialization, and urbanization. The study utilized nine trend
   analysis methods, namely linear regression (LR), Sen's robust slope
   estimator (SS), Mann-Kendall test (MK), Spearman's rank correlation
   (SRC), the trend-free pre-whitening (TFPW), variance correction approach
   by Hamed and Rao (1998) with MK test (MK-CF1), variance correction
   approach by Yue and Wang (2004) with MK test (MK-CF2), block bootstrap
   with MK test (BBS-MK), and graphical method as innovative trend analysis
   (ITA), applied on monthly, annual, and seasonal scales. Additionally,
   the study also employed four homogeneity analysis methods, including
   Pettitt's test, standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT), Buishand's
   test, and Von Neumann Ratio test (VNRTs). The IMD (Indian meteorological
   department) gridded long-term rainfall data from 1901 to 2019 and
   temperature data from 1951 to 2019 are used in the present study to
   assess the homogeneity and trends of the data series. Results showed a
   warming trend of maximum temperature (MaxT) and minimum temperature
   (MinT) at the monthly, annual, and seasonal time scale and significant
   (at 5\%) warming trend in annual MinT in the entire study area. Annual
   rainfall showed negative trend in the study area with significant (at
   5\%) negative trend in eastern deforested area western industrial and
   area adjacent to thermal power station. The change point is detected in
   annual rainfall time series in eastern forest area in 1959 and western
   area in 1983, i.e., after development of the industries and
   commissioning of thermal power station in the western study area. The
   trend rate of MaxT and MinT has been recognized as 0.004 degrees C/year
   and 0.019 degrees C/year, respectively, for the data period of 1951 to
   2019. The annual rainfall trend rate has been observed as -0.743 mm/year
   for the data range 1901 to 2019. All trend analysis methods revealed
   consistent results except MK-CF2 method, which portraits greater number
   of significant trends in trend analysis methods.},

Abstract = {Long-term rainfall and temperature trends of Bundelkhand region of India
   were investigated in this study. The annual, seasonal and monthly
   rainfall trends as well as seasonal and annual minimum, maximum and mean
   temperature trends were analysed using monthly data series of 102 years
   (1901-2002). Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope method were applied
   for trend detection and trend magnitudes determination. Significantly
   decreasing trends during monsoon were found with magnitude ranging from
   1.049 mm/year to 0.497 mm/year. Both increasing and decreasing trends
   were found in the annual rainfall. Large fluctuations in temperature
   trends were observed. Based on the results of rainfall and temperature
   variability of the region, suitability classes for rain-fed agriculture
   were delineated. The negative growth rate was found in the cultivated
   area, production and productivity of paddy, peas and soybean during
   1991-2010. Decreasing trends of rainfall and temperature during monsoon
   and increasing trends of rainfall and temperature in post-monsoon have
   been affected agricultural production of the region.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Sub-Saharan floodplains are sensitive to climatic changes in their
   upstream drainage basin, a major concern is given the dependency of
   millions of people for their daily subsistence. Understanding
   hydroclimatic trends and variability is critical for developing
   integrated coupled human and natural system models to evaluate future
   scenarios of vulnerability. Here we describe the historical climatic
   changes in the Logone River basin using grid-based climatic data during
   a time of concomitant human hydrological modification of the floodplain.
   Temporal trends were analysed by comparing two periods i.e.
   1901/1921-1961 (pre-1960) and 1961-2013 (post-1960). Trends were
   analysed spatially based on the basin's two Koppen climatic zones:
   savanna (Aw) covering the southern upstream areas and semi-arid hot
   (BSh) covering the northern downstream areas. The results show
   significant increasing trends in maximum and minimum temperatures and
   potential evapotranspiration (PET), and non-significant decreasing
   trends in annual rainfall and number of rainy days, across the study
   area. These climatic changes on temporal and spatial scales play an
   important role for the coupled natural and human systems in the Logone
   floodplain.},

Volume = {26},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This paper diagnoses the temperature trends in maximum (T-max) and
   minimum temperatures (T-min) over a selection of 65 stations spread over
   the southeast United States (SEUS) from three observed datasets. They
   are the Cooperative Observer network program (COOP), the COOP data
   corrected for documented shifts in time of observation (COOP1), and the
   COOP data additionally corrected for documented changes in
   instrumentation (COOP2). These 65 stations have been isolated for having
   the three observed datasets for the same time period from 1948 to 2009.
   The authors' comparisons suggest that COOP2 displays stronger warming
   (cooling) trends in T-max (T-min) compared with COOP1 in all four
   seasons. This is consistent with the expectation from the bias
   correction applied for the instrument change. In comparison, the
   differences between COOP and COOP2 are relatively larger. In the spring,
   summer, and fall seasons, the median T-max trend is warming in COOP2
   while it is cooling in COOP. In the winter season, the median trends of
   T-max in the two datasets are positive, but their magnitudes are
   substantially different. Similarly, in the winter, summer, and fall
   seasons, the warming trend in T-min in COOP is contrary to the cooling
   trend in COOP2. In the spring season, the median trend in T-min is
   comparable between the two datasets. COOP2 shows the relationship of
   trends in T-min, with the extent of urbanization in these 65 stations,
   to be statistically significant and to be consistent with expectations
   from theory in contrast to the COOP data.},

Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the global climate is changing as a
   result of anthropogenic activity. Short-term mean, maximum, and minimum
   temperatures of the city Rize located at the Eastern Black Sea Coast of
   Turkey were analyzed to reveal trends, change points, significant
   warming (cooling) periods, and trend rates per year. An increasing trend
   of approximately 1.27 degrees C/33 years (alpha = 0.001) in the annual
   mean temperatures is found during the period from 1975 to 2007. Two
   periods, averaging 13.78 and 14.66 degrees C, respectively, were
   detected from fluctuation in the annual mean temperatures. The trend of
   the first period (1975-1993) is towards a cooler climate, whereas the
   trend of the second period (1994-2007) is towards a warmer climate.
   Summer, autumn and, particularly, the spring mean temperatures have
   tended to increase strongly, whereas the winter mean temperatures have
   increased slightly over the whole period. For the winter mean
   temperature, the trend rate indicates a slight increase, which is
   insignificant. Maximum temperatures have dramatically increased with
   1.61 degrees C (alpha = 0.001) over the last 33 years. However, annual
   minimum temperatures have increased by 0.99 degrees C (alpha = 0.01)
   over the same period.},

Abstract = {By the Empirical Mode Decomposition method, we analyzed the observed
   monthly average temperature in more than 700 stations from 1951-2001
   over China. Simultaneously, the temperature variability of each station
   is calculated by this method, and classification chart of long term
   trend and temperature variability distributing chart of China are
   obtained, supported by GIS, 1 kmx1 km resolution. The results show that:
   in recent 50 years, the temperature has increased by more than 0.4
   degrees C/10a in most parts of northern China, while in Southwest China
   and the middle and lower Yangtze Valley, the increase is not
   significant. The areas with a negative temperature change rate are
   distributed sporadically in Southwest China. Meanwhile, the temperature
   data from 1881 to 2001 in nine study regions in China are also analyzed,
   indicating that in the past 100 years, the temperature has been
   increasing all the way in Northeast China, North China, South China,
   Northwest China and Xinjiang and declining in Southwest China. An
   inverse `V-shaped' trend is also found in Central China. But in Tibet
   the change is less significant.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a study of urban and rural temperature trends in
   proximity to the most populous metropolitan areas of the US. As data
   from urban meteorological stations are typically eliminated or adjusted
   for use in continental and global analyses of climate change, few
   studies have addressed how temperatures are changing in the areas most
   vulnerable to the public health impacts of warming: large cities. In
   this study, temperature data from urban and proximate rural stations for
   50 large US metropolitan areas are analysed to establish the mean
   decadal rate of change in urban temperatures, rural temperatures, and
   heat island intensity over five decades. The results of this analysis
   find the mean decadal rate of change in the heat island intensity of
   large US cities between 1951 and 2000 to be 0.05 degrees C and further
   show a clear division in temperature trends between cities situated in
   the northeastern and southern regions of the country. Copyright (C) 2007

   direct effects of declining snow-cover on surface spectral reflectance
   and NDVI, and (2) enhanced vegetation growth and green biomass
   stimulated by warmer air temperatures and potentially greater vegetation
   absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) during the

Abstract = {Eighteen years of seasonal 10-member ensemble simulations have been

   initial conditions, systematic errors of precipitation and radiation
   fluxes at the land surface, and increasing CO2. The model reproduces a
   global warming trend in surface temperature similar to that observed.
   This appears to be attributable to the influence of SST. However,
   surface flux replacement and atmospheric initialization can reduce the
   SST-driven trend even while improving the spatial pattern of surface air
   temperature. The results also show that land surface interaction has an
   effect both on surface temperature and the higher levels of the
   troposphere. However, realistically increasing CO2 concentrations have
   little impact in these seasonal simulations.},

   presented based on 6-hourly data from 196 stations for the period of

   associated with monsoon circulations in the southeast.
   Trends during 1951-94 are estimated for each station and for four
   regions of the country, with attention paid to the effects of changes in
   instrumentation, observing time, and station locations. The data show
   evidence of increases in both temperature and atmospheric moisture
   content. Temperature and specific humidity trends are larger at
   nighttime than daytime and larger in winter than summer. Moisture
   increases are observed over most of China. The increases are several
   percent per decade for specific humidity, and several tenths of a degree
   per decade for temperature and dewpoint. Increasing trends in summertime
   temperature and humidity contribute to upward trends in apparent

Title = {The Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA) as a Simple Qualitative
   Method to Detect Changes in Environment-Example Detecting Trends of the
   Total Monthly Precipitation in Semiarid Area},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Precipitation is a crucial component of the water cycle, and its
   unpredictability may dramatically influence agriculture, ecosystems, and
   water resource management. On the other hand, climate variability has
   caused water scarcity in many countries in recent years. Therefore, it
   is extremely important to analyze future changes of precipitation data
   in countries facing climate change. In this study, the Innovative
   Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA) method was applied for precipitation trend
   detection at seven stations located in the Wadi Sly basin, in Algeria,
   during a 50-year period (1968-2018). In particular, the IPTA method was
   applied separately for both arithmetic mean and standard deviation.
   Additionally, results from the IPTA method were compared to the results
   of trend analysis based on the Mann-Kendall test and the Sen's slope
   estimator. For the different stations, the first results showed that
   there is no regular polygon in the IPTA graphics, thus indicating that
   precipitation data varies by years. As an example, IPTA result plots of
   both the arithmetic mean and standard deviation data for the Saadia
   station consist of many polygons. This result means that the monthly
   total precipitation data is not constant and the data is unstable. In
   any case, the application of the IPTA method showed different trend
   behaviors, with a precipitation increase in some stations and decrease
   in others. This increasing and decreasing variability emerges from
   climate change. IPTA results point to a greater focus on flood risk
   management in severe seasons and drought risk management in transitional
   seasons across the Wadi Sly basin. When comparing the results of trend
   analysis from the IPTA method and the rest of the analyzed tests, good
   agreement was shown between all methods. This shows that the IPTA method
   can be used for preliminary analysis trends of monthly precipitation.},

Abstract = {Time series of mesospheric temperature and pressure altitude are
   produced through combining observations by the Halogen Occultation
   Experiment (HALOE), Sounding of the Atmosphere Using Broadband Emission
   Radiometry (SABER), and Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE)
   instruments. Time series of both temperature and pressure altitude are
   produced through the combination of HALOE/SABER providing 29 years in
   length and HALOE/SOFIE providing 22 years in length. The different
   sampling of the three instruments constrains the time series to June in
   the northern hemisphere and December in the southern hemisphere and 6470
   degrees in both hemispheres. We interpret the time series by fitting
   them to simple descriptions of the variations including solar,
   intra-hemispheric, inter-hemispheric, and linear trend terms. The
   inferred intra- and inter-hemispheric terms show that dynamical
   influences rival solar variability in the mesosphere. We find a robust
   result that the mesosphere is in general cooling at most altitudes at
   approximately 1-2 K per decade in response to greenhouse gas increases.
   That cooling leads to a shrinking of the atmosphere on the order of
   100-200 m per decade. The shrinking leads to a reduction in cooling and
   eventually a warming near 0.005 hPa due to hydrostatic contraction.},

   surface temperature gradient},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Pages = {33+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The east-west gradient in equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature has
   strengthened, but models suggest the opposite in past and future
   climates. Model ensembles show that the observed trend can arise from
   internal variability but their gradient weakens in the long term,
   causing more climate warming.
   The equatorial Pacific zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient,
   known to be a pacemaker of global warming, has strengthened since the
   mid-twentieth century. However, the cause is controversial because a
   majority of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models
   suggest weakening of the zonal SST gradient from the past to the future.
   Reconciling this discrepancy is important for the climate change
   attribution and climate sensitivity assessment. Here we use the CMIP5
   ensemble and large ensemble simulations by four climate models to show
   that the intensifying SST gradient observed during 1951-2010 could arise
   from internal climate variability. Models and members that simulate
   historical strengthening of the SST gradient commonly exhibit reversed
   future trends. Using these models as a constraint, the rate of
   global-mean temperature rise is amplified by 9-30\%, with higher values
   occurring in low-emission scenarios, because internal variability has a
   greater impact when the externally forced response is smaller.},

Abstract = {The success of kharif crops in India is largely dependent on the
   performance of South west monsoon, whereas the rabi crops which are
   largely irrigated are sensitive to changes in temperature. Trends in
   minimum temperature for the period 1971-2009 were analyzed using 0.5
   degrees grid data for annual, kharif and rabi cropping seasons at the
   district level. Annual mean minimum temperature showed warming @ 0.24
   degrees 10 yr(-1) on all India basis. Large area (52.7\% in kharif;
   54.9\% in rabi) showed strong and significant warming trend. The
   magnitude of rise in seasonal mean temperatures is more during rabi
   (0.28 degrees C 10 yr(-1)) compared to kharif (0.19 degrees C 10
   yr(-1)). Kharif paddy yields in 268 districts across the country (57.2\%
   of paddy growing area) were influenced by a rise in minimum temperature.
   Declines in kharif paddy yield ranged between 411 and 859 kg ha(-1) per
   1 degrees C rise in minimum temperature across regions. This warming
   trend is likely to continue with significant implication on crop yields
   and calls for development of suitable adaptation strategies to sustain
   production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We examined trends in minimum and maximum temperatures in the Oahu
   during the period of past 39 (1969-2007) and 25 (1983-2007) years. We
   found a strong spatial and temporal variability in the temperature
   trends on Oahu. During the past 39years, island-wide minimum temperature
   has increased by 0.17 degrees C/decade and shows a considerable
   variability in trends at individual location. There was no detectable
   trend found in maximum temperature over the same time period. The year
   1983 was identified as the change point in the island-wide minimum
   temperature. During the recent 25years annual and summer maximum
   temperature showed a decline while minimum temperature continued to
   increase. Trend in diurnal temperature range (DTR) shows a decline
   during the past 39years with a stronger decreasing trend during the
   recent 25years. The trend in DTR for Oahu is much higher compared to the
   global DTR trend indicating a rapid warming in minimum temperature.
   Extreme temperature indices show a general warming during the past
   39years. There has been significant increase in tropical and warm nights
   at the two urban stations. Maximum temperature generally followed the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) except the period when there is an
   increase in Hawaii Rainfall Index (HRI). In contrast, minimum
   temperature showed better agreement with HRI compared to the PDO, at
   least up until 1999 after which it showed an increase. Despite the
   relative cooling in PDO during the recent decade an increase in minimum
   temperature can be attributed to a decline in HRI.},

Title = {Vent temperature trends at the Vulcano Fossa fumarole field: the role of
   permeability},
Journal = {BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {74},

Pages = {1293-1311},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Between 1994 and 2010, we completed 16 thermal surveys of Vulcano's
   Fossa fumarole field (Aeolian Islands, Italy). In each survey, between
   400 and 1,200 vent temperatures were collected using a thermal infrared
   thermometer from distances of similar to 1 m. The results show a general
   decrease in average vent temperature during 1994-2003, with the average
   for the entire field falling from similar to 220A degrees C in 1994 to
   similar to 150A degrees C by 2003. However, between 2004 and 2010, we
   witnessed heating, with the average increasing to similar to 190A
   degrees C by 2010. Alongside these annual-scale field-wide trends, we
   record a spatial re-organisation of the fumarole field, characterised by
   shut down of vent zones towards the crater floor, matched by
   rejuvenation of zones located towards the crater rim. Heating may be
   expected to be associated with deflation because increased amounts of
   vaporisation will remove volume from the hydrothermal system Gambino and
   Guglielmino (J Geophys Res 113:B07402, 2008). However, over the
   2004-2010 heating period, no ground deformation was observed. Instead,
   the number of seismic events increased from a typical rate of 37 events
   per month during 1994-2000 to 195 events per month during 2004-2010. As
   part of this increase, we noticed a much greater number of
   high-frequency events associated with rock fracturing. We thus suggest
   that the heating event of 2004-2010 was the result of changed
   permeability conditions, rather than change in the heat supply from the
   deeper magmatic source. Within this scenario, cooling causes shut down
   of lower sectors and re-establishment of pathways located towards the
   crater rim, causing fracturing, increased seismicity and heat flow in
   these regions. This is consistent with the zone of rejuvenation (which
   lies towards and at the rim) being the most favourable location for
   fracturing given the stress field of the Fossa cone Schopa et al. (J
   Volcanol Geotherm Res 203:133-145, 2011); it is also the most
   established zone, having been active at least since the early twentieth
   century. Our data show the value of deploying multi-disciplinary
   geophysical campaigns at degassing (fumarolic) hydrothermal systems.
   This allows more complete and constrained understanding of the true heat
   loss dynamics of the system. In the case study presented here, it allows
   us to distinguish true heating from apparent heating phases. While the
   former are triggered from the bottom-up, i.e. they are driven by
   increases in heat supply from the magmatic source, the latter are
   triggered from the top-down, i.e. by changing permeability conditions in
   the uppermost portion of the system to allow more efficient heat flow
   over zones predisposed to fracturing.},

Title = {Urbanization Effects in Estimating Surface Air Temperature Trends in the
   Contiguous United States},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the past century, local-scale warming caused by a strengthening urban
   heat island effect has brought inevitable systematic bias to
   observational data from surface weather stations located in or near
   urban areas. In this study, the land use situation around U.S. Climate
   Reference Network (USCRN) stations was used as a reference for rural
   station selection; stations with similar environmental conditions in the
   U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) were selected as reference
   stations using a machine learning method, and then the maximum surface
   air temperature (Tmax) series, minimum surface air temperature (Tmin)
   series and mean surface air temperature (Tmean) series of rural stations
   during 1921-2020 were compared with those for all nearby stations
   (including both rural and urban stations) to evaluate urbanization
   effects in the USHCN observation data series of the contiguous United
   States, which can be regarded as urbanization bias contained in the
   latest homogenized USHCN observation data. The results showed that the
   urbanization effect on the Tmean trend of USHCN stations is 0.002
   degrees C dec-1, and the urbanization contribution is 35\%, indicating
   that urbanization around USHCN stations has led to at least one-third of
   the overall warming recorded at USHCN stations over the last one hundred
   years. The urbanization effects on Tmax and Tmin trends of USHCN
   stations are -0.015 degrees C dec-1 and 0.013 degrees C dec-1,
   respectively, and the urbanization contribution for Tmin is 34\%. These
   results have significance for understanding the systematic bias in USHCN
   temperature data, and they provide a reference for subsequent studies on
   data correction and climate change monitoring.},

   temperature trend},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {The multi-scale variability of global sea surface temperature (GSST),
   which is often dominated by secular trends, significantly impacts global
   and regional climate change. Previous studies were mainly carried out
   under linear assumptions. Even if the nonlinear evolution patterns have
   been discussed based on annual-mean data, the conclusions are still
   insufficient due to several factors. Here, based on the Ensemble
   Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method, the robustness of GSST
   trends tied to the sampling frequency and time interval selection is
   further explored. The main features derived from the annual-mean data
   are maintained. However, monthly and seasonal-mean data both mute the
   cooling in the equatorial central Pacific and the Southern Ocean in the
   Pacific sector, meanwhile intensify and expand the warming over the
   North Pacific. The results also highlight that early data cause a
   minimal effect on secular trends except for the portion near the start
   point of the interval due to the local temporal nature of EEMD. Overall,
   the long-term GSST trends extracted by EEMD have good robustness. Our
   research also clarifies that quadratic fitting cannot reveal all the
   meaningful evolution patterns, even as a nonlinear solution.},

Title = {Observations of positive sea surface temperature trends in the steadily

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {11},
Pages = {3007-3018},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Increasing warming of steadily shrinking Dead Sea surface water
   compensates for surface water cooling (due to increasing evaporation)
   and even causes observed positive Dead Sea sea surface temperature
   trends. This warming is caused by two factors: increasing daytime heat
   flow from land to sea (as a result of the steady shrinking) and regional
   atmospheric warming. Using observations from the Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), positive trends were detected in both
   daytime and nighttime Dead Sea sea surface temperature (SST) over the
   period of 2000-2016. These positive SST trends were observed in the
   absence of positive trends in surface solar radiation, measured by the
   Dead Sea buoy pyranometer. We also show that long-term changes in water
   mixing in the uppermost layer of the Dead Sea under strong winds could
   not explain the observed SST trends. There is a positive feedback loop
   between the positive SST trends and the steady shrinking of the Dead
   Sea, which contributes to the accelerating decrease in Dead Sea water
   levels during the period under study. Satellite-based SST measurements
   showed that maximal SST trends of over 0.8 degrees C decade(-1) were
   observed over the northwestern and southern sides of the Dead Sea, where
   shrinking of the Dead Sea water area was pronounced. No noticeable SST
   trends were observed over the eastern side of the lake, where shrinking
   of the Dead Sea water area was insignificant. This finding demonstrates
   correspondence between the positive SST trends and the shrinking of the
   Dead Sea indicating a causal link between them. There are two opposite
   processes taking place in the Dead Sea: sea surface warming and cooling.
   On the one hand, the positive feedback loop leading to sea surface
   warming every year accompanied by long-term increase in SST; on the
   other hand, the measured acceleration of the Dead Sea water-level drop
   suggests a long-term increase in Dead Sea evaporation accompanied by a
   long-term decrease in SST. During the period under investigation, the
   total result of these two opposite processes is the statistically
   significant positive sea surface temperature trends in both daytime (0.6
   degrees C decade(-1)) and nighttime (0.4 degrees C decade(-1)), observed
   by the MODIS instrument. Our findings of the existence of a positive
   feedback loop between the positive SST trends and the shrinking of the
   Dead Sea imply the following significant point: any meteorological,
   hydrological or geophysical process causing the steady shrinking of the
   Dead Sea will contribute to positive trends in SST. Our results shed
   light on continuing hazards to the Dead Sea.},

Abstract = {{[}1] The linear trends in oceanic temperature from 1960 to 1999 are
   estimated using the new Indian Ocean Thermal Archive (IOTA), a
   compilation of historical temperature profiles. Widespread surface
   warming is found, as in other data sets, and reproduced in IPCC climate
   model simulations for the 20th century. This warming is particularly
   large in the subtropics, and extends down to 800 m around 40-50 degrees
   S. Models suggest the deep-reaching subtropical warming is related to a
   0.5 degrees southward shift of the subtropical gyre driven by a
   strengthening of the westerly winds, and associated with an upward trend
   in the Southern Annular Mode index. In the tropics, IOTA shows a
   subsurface cooling corresponding to a shoaling of the thermocline and
   increasing vertical stratification. Most models suggest this trend in
   the tropical Indian thermocline is likely associated with the observed
   weakening of the Pacific trade winds and transmitted to the Indian Ocean
   by the Indonesian throughflow.},

Title = {Recent trends and variability of temperature and atmospheric water vapor
   over South Asia},

Abstract = {This study examines the recent trends and variability of temperature and
   atmospheric water vapor over South Asia during the summer monsoon season
   from 1970 to 2022. We employ gridded reanalysis and observational
   datasets to assess the trends and variability in surface temperature and
   further investigate the associated physical processes. Our results show
   that the surface temperature over South Asia has increased by 0.5
   degrees C per decade. Notably, we find a statistically significant major
   transition in the surface temperature series in 1995, such that
   1970-1994 (1995-2022) is associated with anomalous cooling (anomalous
   warming). Since 1995, not only have the temporal variations in regional
   surface temperature, atmospheric water vapor, and clear-sky downward
   longwave radiation been synchronous at interannual scales, but their
   largest spatial variations have been located mainly over the same
   region. A diagnosis of the atmospheric moisture budget reveals that the
   observed changes in water vapor convergence over South Asia are
   dominated by changes in mean circulation dynamics, while the change in
   thermodynamics is relatively small. The enhancement of the Somali
   low-level jet may contribute to increased water vapor in South Asia by
   modulating low-level circulations.},

Abstract = {High temperature sensors based on solid electrolytes are well
   established in many applications. In this context. stabilized zirconia
   as an oxygen ion conductor plays the key role to monitor oxygen. Recent
   trends in the use of stabilized zirconia aim at the detection of other
   exhaust or environmental gases like NOx, CO or hydrocarbons. This is
   possible by, e.g. monitoring currents of specific electrode reactions at
   a given voltage ('amperometric devices') or monitoring voltages between
   different electrodes which result from specific electrode reactions
   including the kinetically determined formation of surface oxygen during
   different catalytic reactions {[}'mixed-potential (non-Nernstian)
   devices']. In all applications, the catalytic and electrochemical
   properties of the electrode materials play a key role for achieving
   reproducible sensor signals. This requires controlled microstructures
   down to the atomic scale. Therefore, extensive work now focuses on the
   structural as well as functional optimization of known, and on the
   development of new electrode materials. In this promising trend
   particular emphasis is put on the in-situ spectroscopic and microscopic
   characterization of the various interfaces under sensor operation
   conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This investigation analyzes trends in the variability of daily and
   monthly near-surface air temperatures. We examined the 5 degrees
   latitude by 5 degrees longitude monthly temperature anomalies available
   for many grids around the world. Overall, the trend in intra-annual
   temperature variance is towards reduced variability and is highly
   significant over the past 50 and 100 yr. We then examined daily maximum
   and minimum temperatures from the United States, China, and the former
   Soviet Union for intra-monthly variability in January and July. Most of
   the trends also indicated declining variability. A final approach
   examined the occurrence of record-setting daily maximum and minimum
   temperatures from the same countries. We found no evidence for an
   increase in record temperatures. The fact that intra-annual and
   intra-monthly variance is declining suggests that we should see fewer
   record temperatures in recent years. There is some evidence for this in
   the daily data. In general, our results argue against the proposition
   that temperatures have become more variable as global temperatures have
   changed in this century.},

Abstract = {Large uncertainties exist in Holocene climate estimates, especially for
   the early Holocene when large-scale reorganization occurred in the
   climate system. To improve our understanding of these uncertainties, we
   compare four Holocene simulations performed with the LOVECLIM, CCSM3,
   HadCM3 and FAMOUS climate models. The simulations are generally
   consistent for the large-scale Northern Hemisphere extratropics, while
   the multi-simulation consistencies are heterogeneous on the
   sub-continental scale. Consistently simulated temperature trends are
   found in Greenland, northern Canada, north-eastern and north-western
   Europe, and central-west Siberia. These Holocene temperatures show a
   pattern of an early Holocene warming, mid-Holocene warmth and gradual
   decrease towards the pre-industrial in winter, and the extent of early
   Holocene warming varies spatially, with 9 degrees C warming in northern
   Canada compared with 3 degrees C warming in central-west Siberia. In
   contrast, mismatched temperatures are detected: in Alaska, the warm
   early Holocene winter in LOVECLIM primarily results from strongly
   enhanced southerly winds induced by the ice sheets; in eastern Siberia,
   the intense early-Holocene summer warmth anomaly in CCSM3 is caused by
   large negative albedo anomalies due to overestimated snow cover at 0 ka;
   in the Arctic, cool winter conditons in FAMOUS can be attributed to
   extensive sea ice coverage probably due to simplified sea ice
   representations. Thus, the Holocene temperature trends in these regions
   remain inconclusive. Copyright (C) 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {The vertical structure of temperature trends in the northeastern
   Atlantic (NEA) is investigated using a blend of Argo and hydrography
   data. The representativeness of sparse hydrography sampling in the basin
   mean is assessed using a numerical model. Between 2003 and 2013, the NEA
   underwent a strong surface cooling (0-450 m) and a significant warming
   at intermediate and deep levels (1000 m to 3000 m) that followed a
   strong cooling trend observed between 1988 and 2003. During 2003-2013,
   gyre-specific changes are found in the upper 1000 m (warming and cooling
   of the subtropical and subpolar gyres, respectively), while the
   intermediate and deep warming primarily occurred in the subpolar gyre,
   with important contributions from isopycnal heave and water mass
   property changes. The full-depth temperature change requires a local
   downward heat flux of 0.53 0.06 W m(-2) through the sea surface, and its
   vertical distribution highlights the likely important role of the NEA in
   the recent global warming hiatus.},

Title = {Temperature Trend Patterns in Southern Hemisphere High Latitudes: Novel
   Indicators of Stratospheric Change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {22},
Number = {23},
Pages = {6325-6341},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Robust stratospheric temperature trend patterns are suggested in the
   winter and spring seasons in the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes from
   the satellite-borne Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) measurement for
   1979-2007. These patterns serve as indicators of key processes governing
   temperature and ozone changes in the Antarctic. The observed patterns
   are characterized by cooling and warming regions of comparable
   magnitudes, with the strongest local trends occurring in September and
   October. In September, ozone depletion induces radiative cooling, and
   strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) induces dynamical
   warming. Because the trends induced by these two processes are centered
   in different locations in September, they do not cancel each other, but
   rather produce a wavelike structure. In contrast, during October, the
   ozone-induced radiative cooling and the BDC-induced warming exhibit a
   more zonally symmetric structure than in September, and hence largely
   cancel each other. However, the October quasi-stationary planetary
   wavenumber 1 has shifted eastward from 1979 to 2007, producing a zonal
   wavenumber-1 trend structure, which dominates the observed temperature
   trend pattern.
   Simulated temperature changes for 1979-2007 from coupled
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) experiments run for
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report
   (IPCC AR4) are compared with the observations. In general, the simulated
   temperature changes are dominated by zonally symmetric ozone-induced
   radiative cooling. The models fail to simulate the warming in the
   southern polar stratosphere, implying a lack of the BDC strengthening in
   these models. They also fail to simulate the quasi-stationary planetary
   wave changes observed in October and November.},

Title = {CONSISTENCY CHECK FOR TRENDS IN SURFACE-TEMPERATURE AND UPPER-LEVEL
   CIRCULATION - 1950-1992},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {6},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2288-2297},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A time series of 43 years of observed monthly mean air temperature at
   109 sites in the 48 contiguous United States is compared to monthly mean
   air temperature specified from hemispheric gridded 700-mb heights.
   Because both upper-air and surface data have problems that may limit
   their use in climate change studies, this comparison could be considered
   a mutual consistency check. Cooling (by about 0.5 degrees C) from 1951
   to about 1970 and subsequent warming (also by 0.5 degrees C) that
   continues through the present are found in both datasets, indicating
   that these interdecadal changes are probably real.
   In the last several years the specified temperatures were often colder
   than those observed. This prompted an investigation of whether the
   `'residual'' (specified minus observed) has recently been large (and
   negative) compared to the earlier part of the record. It was found that
   for the same 700-mb height field, surface temperatures were almost a
   degree Celsius warmer in the last few years than they were in the early
   1950s, but considering the variability of the residuals over the 1950-92
   period, the recent cold residuals may not yet be strikingly unusual.
   By comparing the full set of 109 stations to a `'clean'' subset of 24,
   the impact of common problems in surface data (station relocation,
   urbanization, etc.) was found to be quite small. The rather favorable
   comparison of observed surface temperatures and specified surface
   temperatures (which suffer from upper-air analysis/observation changes
   over the years) indicates that their respective data problems do not
   appear to invalidate their use in studies of interdecadal temperature
   change.},

Title = {Temperature and dissolved oxygen trends in English estuaries over the
   past 30 years},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {306},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Water temperature and dissolved oxygen are two important parameters
   which affect the ecosystem functions which estuaries provide. As such,
   we need to understand the long-term change of these parameters in
   English estuaries to better understand those areas which may be
   vulnerable in the present and future. Detecting these trends in
   monitoring data is difficult however, since temporally and spatially
   heterogeneous sampling has the potential to obscure any long-term
   component of change. In this study, we use a generalized additive model
   (GAM) approach to isolate the inter-annual change of water temperature
   and dissolved oxygen in spot sampled monitoring data across English
   estuaries. This technique can account for the potentially non-linear
   variability caused by temporal and spatial variations in sampling
   throughout the day and year. We find that water temperature in all
   modelled estuaries has warmed, with an average warming of 0.037 degree
   celsius/yr between 1990 and 2022, in line with temperature change in
   rivers and the sea surface around England. For the same period,
   dissolved oxygen has increased for roughly half of modelled estuaries
   and decreased for the other half. The variation across English estuaries
   in these two conditions is best explained by the geographical location
   of an estuary. Many of the estuaries warming at the greatest rate are
   those where sea surface temperature increase has also been greatest. We
   suggest the observed distribution of changes in dissolved oxygen can be
   explained by three processes: (1) temperature driven change, (2)
   dissolved oxygen improvement (e.g., reduced nutrient inputs through
   wastewater management regulation) and (3) changes in the number of
   primary productivity-induced super saturation events. This study
   provides a comprehensive look at temperature and dissolved oxygen change
   across English estuaries over the past similar to 30 years, which may
   provide information on the processes behind how these water quality
   parameters have changed and will continue to do so.},

Abstract = {The present study estimates spatial and temporal (seasonal/annual)
   trends in daytime land surface tem-perature (LST) and its drivers
   (elevation, cloud fraction (CF), atmospheric water vapor (AWV),
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and snow cover area
   (SCA)) over the High Mountain Asia (HMA) dur-ing 2001-2019 using MODIS
   remote sensing data. The findings of the study showed mixed trends in
   LST in the region with intra-regional variations. Overall, the warming
   in the region is attributed to increasing AWV and NDVI and declining CF
   and SCA. The study also found evidence of elevation-dependent warm-ing
   (EDW) (4500-5500 m AMSL) in some regions. However, the same conclusion
   cannot be drawn in all the sub-regions of HMA, suggesting the need to
   explore the effects of additional natural and anthro-pogenic factors on
   LST with fine resolution data to improve the understanding of its

Title = {Southern Ocean in-situ temperature trends over 25 years emerge from
   interannual variability},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Despite playing a major role in global ocean heat storage, the Southern
   Ocean remains the most sparsely measured region of the global ocean.
   Here, a unique 25-year temperature time-series of the upper 800m,
   repeated several times a year across the Southern Ocean, allows us to
   document the long-term change within water-masses and how it compares to
   the interannual variability. Three regions stand out as having strong
   trends that dominate over interannual variability: warming of the
   subantarctic waters (0.290.09 degrees C per decade); cooling of the
   near-surface subpolar waters (-0.07 +/- 0.04 degrees C per decade); and
   warming of the subsurface subpolar deep waters (0.04 +/- 0.01 degrees C
   per decade). Although this subsurface warming of subpolar deep waters is
   small, it is the most robust long-term trend of our section, being in a
   region with weak interannual variability. This robust warming is
   associated with a large shoaling of the maximum temperature core in the
   subpolar deep water (39 +/- 09m per decade), which has been
   significantly underestimated by a factor of 3 to 10 in past studies. We
   find temperature changes of comparable magnitude to those reported in
   Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas, which calls for a reconsideration of
   current ocean changes with important consequences for our understanding
   of future Antarctic ice-sheet mass loss. The Southern Ocean takes up the
   most heat and carbon, yet because of its remote and harsh location, it
   remains relatively sparsely measured. Here the authors use a 25 year
   temperature series which shows a clear, long term trend in subsurface
   warming that emerges from interannual variability.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Extreme temperatures and heat wave trends in five cities within the
   Sonoran Desert region (e.g., Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, in the United
   States and Ciudad Obregon and San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora; and
   Mexicali, Baja California, in Mexico) and one city within the Mojave
   Desert region (e.g., Las Vegas, Nevada) were assessed using field data
   collected from 1950 to 2014. Instead of being selected by watershed, the
   cities were selected because they are part of the same arid climatic
   region. The data were analyzed for maximum temperature increases and the
   trends were confirmed statistically using Spearman's nonparametric test.
   Temperature trends were correlated with the mortality information
   related with extreme heat events in the region. The results showed a
   clear trend of increasing maximum temperatures during the months of
   June, July, and August for five of the six cities and statically
   confirmed using Spearman's rho values. Las Vegas was the only city where
   the temperature increase was not confirmed using Spearman's test,
   probably because it is geographically located outside of the Sonoran
   Desert or because of its proximity to the Hoover Dam. The relationship
   between mortality and temperature was analyzed for the cities of
   Mexicali, Mexico and Phoenix. Arizona.},

Abstract = {A systematic increase in global temperature since the industrial
   revolution has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing. This increase
   has been especially evident over the Himalayas and Central Asia and is
   touted as a major contributing factor for glacier mass balance declines
   across much of this region. However, glaciers of Pakistan's Karakorum
   region have shown no such decline during this time period, and in some
   instances have exhibited slight advance. This discrepancy, known as the
   `Karakorum Anomaly', has been attributed to unusual amounts of debris
   covering the region's glaciers; the unique seasonality of the region's
   precipitation; and localized cooling resulting from increased cloudiness
   from monsoonal moisture. Here we present a tree-ring based
   reconstruction of summer (June-August) temperature from the Karakorum of
   North Pakistan that spans nearly five centuries (1523-2007 C.E.). The
   ring width indices are derived from seven collections (six-Picea
   smithiana and one-Pinus gerardiana) from middle-to-upper timberline
   sites in the northern Karakorum valleys of Gilgit and Hunza at
   elevations ranging from 2850 to 3300 meters above mean sea level (mean
   elevation 3059 m asl). The reconstruction passes all traditional
   calibration-verification schemes and explains 41 \% of the variance of
   the nested Gilgit-Astore instrumental station data (Gilgit-1454 m asl,
   1951-2009; Astore-2167 m asl, 1960-2013). Importantly, our results
   indicate that Karakorum temperature has remained decidedly out of phase
   with hemispheric temperature trends for at the least the past five
   centuries, highlighting the long-term stability of the Karakorum
   Anomaly, and suggesting that the region's temperature and cloudiness are
   contributing factors to the anomaly.},

Abstract = {Monthly mean temperature composite of eleven meteorological stations in
   Cuba for the period 1951-1994 shows a significant change in the years
   following the volcanic eruptions of Mt Agung, El Chichon and Mt
   Pinatubo. The general warming trend for the monthly mean temperature in
   that 44 year period reverses in the four years following every eruption
   to a cooling trend. Comparative analysis of the monthly mean temperature
   trends in the decades 1961-1970 and 1981-1990 with the four year periods
   following the Mt Agung and El Chichon show the possible cooling effect
   Supperposed epoch analysis suggests also the possible cooling trend. Tmm
   anomalies behavior suggest the possible accentuate winter effect. A
   preliminar hypothesis to explain the particular response of an island
   such as Cuba to radiative associate phenomena is proposed.},

Title = {Seasonal lake surface water temperature trends reflected by heterocyst
   glycolipid-based molecular thermometers},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3741-3751},
Abstract = {It has been demonstrated that the relative distribution of heterocyst
   glycolipids (HGs) in cultures of N-2-fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria
   is largely controlled by growth temperature, suggesting a potential use
   of these components in paleoenvironmental studies. Here, we investigated
   the effect of environmental parameters (e.g., surface water
   temperatures, oxygen concentrations and pH) on the distribution of HGs
   in a natural system using water column filtrates collected from Lake
   Schreventeich (Kiel, Germany) from late July to the end of October 2013.
   HPLC-ESI/MS (high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to
   electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry) analysis revealed a dominance
   of 1-(O-hexose)-3,25-hexacosanediols (HG(26) diols) and
   1-(O-hexose)-3-keto-25-hexacosanol (HG(26) keto-ol) in the
   solvent-extracted water column filtrates, which were accompanied by
   minor abundances of 1-(O-hexose)-3,27-octacosanediol (HG(28) diol) and
   1-(O-hexose)-3-keto-27-octacosanol (HG(28) keto-ol) as well as
   1-(O-hexose)-3,25,27-octacosanetriol (HG(28) triol) and
   1-(O-hexose)-3-keto-25,27-octacosanediol (HG(28) keto-diol). Fractional
   abundances of alcoholic and ketonic HGs generally showed strong linear
   correlations with surface water temperatures and no or only weak linear
   correlations with both oxygen concentrations and pH. Changes in the
   distribution of the most abundant diol and keto-ol (e.g., HG(26) diol
   and HG(26) keto-ol) were quantitatively expressed as the HDI26
   (heterocyst diol index of 26 carbon atoms) with values of this index
   ranging from 0.89 in mid-August to 0.66 in mid-October. An average HDI26
   value of 0.79, which translates into a calculated surface water
   temperature of 15.8 +/- 0.3 A degrees C, was obtained from surface
   sediments collected from Lake Schreventeich. This temperature - and
   temperatures obtained from other HG indices (e.g., HDI28 and HTI28) - is
   similar to the one measured during maximum cyanobacterial productivity
   in early to mid-September and suggests that HGs preserved in the
   sediment record of Lake Schreventeich reflect summer surface water
   temperatures. As N-2-fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria are widespread
   in present-day freshwater and brackish environments, we conclude that
   the distribution of HGs in sediments may allow for the reconstruction of
   surface water temperatures of modern and potentially ancient lacustrine
   settings.},

Title = {Daily Temperature Predictive Model and Trend Analysis in Yangon, Myanmar
   Over 25 Years},
Journal = {THAI JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {146-156},
Abstract = {Myanmar is rich in minerals and precious stones. However, agriculture,
   forestry, and fishing together were the main contributors to Myanmars
   economy. Like most other developing countries, the productions of these
   three main contributors are robustly dependent on the climate. The aims
   of this study were (i) to analyze the trend of temperature change in
   Yangon city, Myanmar in the last 25 years and (ii) to investigate the
   appropriate models for the temperature prediction in Yangon, Myanmar.
   Daily temperature from 1996 to 2020 was considered. It was assumed in
   general that the current temperature would be affected by a number of
   temperature of some times earlier. Hence the autoregressive integrated
   moving average (ARIMA) model was taken into account and found that
   ARIMA(4,0,0) was the best model in terms of the smallest values of the
   Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
   Moreover, the multiple linear regression (MLR) and neural network models
   both taking time-lag temperatures as the independent variables has
   confirmed the result by the ARIMA model. In fact, the MLR suggested that
   the last 1 up to 4 days temperatures have significantly contributed to
   the current daily temperature, while the neural network model slightly
   outperforms the other two models measured by the RMSE. Furthermore, a
   broad picture of the temperature in Myanmar's capital has not altered
   considerably in the last 25 years, according to simple linear
   regression.},

Abstract = {This study analyses long-term trends in temperature and wind climatology
   based on ERA5 data. We study climatology and trends separately for every
   decade from 1980 to 2020 and their changes during this period. This
   study is focused on the pressure levels between 100-1 hPa, which
   essentially covers the whole stratosphere. We also analyze the impact of
   the sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW), North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Quasi-biennial
   oscillation (QBO). This helps us to find details of climatology and
   trend behavior in the stratosphere in connection to these phenomena.
   ERA5 is one of the newest reanalysis, which is widely used for the
   middle atmosphere. We identify the largest differences which occur
   between 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 in both temperature climatology and
   trends. We suggest that these differences could relate to the different
   occurrence frequency of SSWs in 1990-2000 versus 2000-2010.},

Pages = {455-478},
Abstract = {This study examines current trends and future changes in five daily
   air-temperature derived proxy indices for freshwater ice regimes. The
   indices are autumn 0 degrees C isotherm date (autumn I-0), spring 0
   degrees C isotherm date (spring I-0), winter duration (WD), maximum
   annual accumulated freezing degree-days (AFDD), and mid-winter thaw
   frequency. A total of 127 meteorological stations distributed across
   Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland) have been used to derive the
   indices for the contemporary period 1961-2010. Results show overall
   trends towards later autumn I-0 and stronger trends towards earlier
   spring I-0. Altogether, WD was shortened by a regional average of -5.2
   +/- 2.9 days per decade, the reduction being significant at 5\% level in
   71 stations. AFDD decreased in all the 127 stations with a regional
   average of -57 +/- 35 degrees C-days per decade. The impact of future
   warming on the indices was investigated using climate signals from the
   IPCC's A1B emissions scenario. The results showed that WD will shorten
   by an average of 36 days in 2041-2070 and by an average of 51 days in
   2071-2100. The ecological and socio-economic impacts of the observed and
   future changes in the indices are qualitatively evaluated.},

Title = {Temperature-Driven Dengue Transmission in a Changing Climate: Patterns,
   Trends, and Future Projections},
Journal = {GEOHEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Dengue is a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne infectious disease that is
   sensitive to climate factors and poses a major public health concern
   worldwide. We analyzed dengue incidence trends and the relationship
   between annual mean minimum temperatures (AMMTs) and dengue incidence
   rates from 1990 to 2019 in 122 countries using the Global Burden of
   Disease and TerraClimate data sets. We also projected global dengue
   incidence rates under different carbon emission scenarios using
   temperature data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6
   (CMIP6) data set. Our results reveal a significant increase in global
   dengue cases from 1990 to 2019 and a positive correlation between
   temperature and dengue incidence. The association between AMMT and
   dengue incidence strengthened at temperatures exceeding 21 degrees C.
   Central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Oceania, were
   identified as the regions most sensitive to dengue; males and
   individuals aged 15-19 or 70-84 years were the most susceptible to
   dengue under rising temperatures. Our projections suggest that global
   dengue incidence will substantially increase by 2050 and 2100. By 2100,
   regions including Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the southern United
   States, southern China, and island countries in the Pacific and Indian
   Oceans are projected to become year-round dengue-endemic under a
   high-emission climate scenario. Our findings underscore the importance
   of implementing effective measures to mitigate the impact of climate
   change on dengue transmission. Identifying high-risk areas and
   susceptible populations, along with understanding the projected
   expansion of dengue-endemic regions, will provide valuable guidance for
   targeted interventions to address this growing global health challenge
   in the face of changing climatic conditions.
   Climate change is driving the rapid spread of several overlooked
   tropical infectious diseases, including dengue, which is a classic
   climate-sensitive infectious disease. Unlike localized infectious
   diseases, dengue occurs globally, making it a major concern. Few studies
   have investigated the effect of climate change on dengue. Regions and
   populations susceptible to dengue should be identified, and dengue
   incidence trends should be analyzed. We analyzed data from 122 countries
   for the period 1990-2019 to investigate the relationship between dengue
   and temperature. We also made predictions about potential dengue
   outbreaks based on the basis of different carbon emissions levels. Our
   analysis revealed a global increase in the incidence of dengue cases and
   a correlation between higher temperatures and more cases. Africa and
   Oceania are particularly sensitive to dengue outbreaks. The effect of
   rising temperature on dengue risk is stronger for male individuals and
   individuals aged 15-19 or 70-84 years. Our projections suggest that
   dengue incidence will continue to increase through 2050 and 2100. Our
   findings emphasize the urgent need to address climate change's effect on
   dengue. By identifying high-risk areas and vulnerable populations,
   efforts for controlling this growing global health challenge can be
   better targeted.
   Global warming significantly contributed to dengue incidence Central and
   eastern sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, males, aged 15-19 and 70-84 years
   were susceptible to dengue under global warming Substantial increases in

   parts per thousand in the early late Valanginian documents a
   perturbation of the carbon cycle. This positive CIE, which is well known
   as the `Weissert Event' in the Tethys, is also displayed in composite
   carbon isotope records based on published and own data from three
   different palaeolatitudes (35 degrees, 39 degrees, 65 degrees North).
   These findings suggest that the environmental changes indicated by the
   CIE in the early late Valanginian are synchronous, thereby pointing to a
   global control. The combined oxygen isotope data sets show long-term
   fluctuations of up to 7 degrees C with a cooling in the late Valanginian
   for both the southern and the arctic part of the Boreal Realm, whilst
   Tethyan data document only a ca. 1 degrees C cooling. Based on a
   reliable bio- and chemostratigraphic correlation between the different
   realms this study highlights the amplitude of the environmental
   perturbations in the Valanginian and supports the idea that a
   combination of regional and global factors caused such shifts. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This study analyzes the ability of statistical downscaling models in
   simulating the long-term trend of temperature and associated causes at
   48 stations in northern China in January and July 1961-2006. The
   statistical downscaling models are established through multiple stepwise
   regressions of predictor principal components (PCs). The predictors in
   this study include temperature at 850 hPa (T850), and the combination of
   geopotential height and temperature at 850 hPa (H850+T850). For the
   combined predictors, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the
   two combined fields is conducted. The modeling results from HadCM3 and
   ECHAM5 under 20C3M and SERS A1B scenarios are applied to the statistical
   downscaling models to construct local present and future climate change
   scenarios for each station, during which the projected EOF analysis and
   the common EOF analysis are utilized to derive EOFs and PCs from the two
   general circulation models (GCMs). The results show that (1) the trend
   of temperature in July is associated with the first EOF pattern of the
   two combined fields, not with the EOF pattern of the regional warming;
   (2) although HadCM3 and ECHAM5 have simulated a false long-term trend of
   temperature, the statistical downscaling method is able to well
   reproduce a correct long-term trend of temperature in northern China due
   to the successful simulation of the trend of main PCs of the GCM
   predictors; (3) when the two-field combination and the projected EOF
   analysis are used, temperature change scenarios have a similar seasonal
   variation to the observed one; and (4) compared with the results of the
   common EOF analysis, those of the projected EOF analysis have been much
   more strongly determined by the observed large-scale atmospheric
   circulation patterns.},

Abstract = {This paper documents the change of temperature indices for the growing
   season (April-September) and dormancy (October-March) in Serbia based on
   observations from 26 meteorological stations. The mean, maximum, and
   minimum daily temperatures, as well as eight extreme temperature
   indices, were examined. A trend analysis revealed uneven changes in the
   growing season and dormant temperatures during the observation period
   divided into two parts (1961-1980 and 1981-2010) according to the
   results of the sequential Mann-Kendall test for detecting change points
   in time series. The dormant temperature changes were quite uniform
   during the entire examined period, while the growing season temperature
   displayed a complex pattern of change. In the sub-period 1961-1980, all
   examined temperature indices exhibited a cooling tendency during the
   growing season and a warming tendency during dormancy. A larger
   decreasing trend was detected in the growing season maximum temperature
   (a nationally averaged rate - 1.10 degrees C per decade) and related
   indices than in the growing season minimum temperature (a nationally
   averaged rate - 0.37 degrees C per decade) and related indices. In the
   same sub-period, the dormant maximum and minimum temperatures increased
   at the same rate of 0.49 degrees C per decade on average for all
   stations. During the sub-period 1981-2010, a warming tendency was
   detected both in the growing season and dormant temperature indices with
   similar magnitudes of the change (minimum and maximum temperatures
   increased on average from 0.48 to 0.56 degrees C per decade).
   Examination of the relationship between the temperature indices and
   large-scale circulation patterns revealed that only the East Atlantic
   pattern displayed significant association with trends of examined
   indices, but only during the growing season in the sub-period 1981-2010.},

Title = {Trend and Abrupt Regime Shift of Temperature Extreme in Northeast China,
   1957-2015},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Trend and an abrupt regime shift of temperature extremes were
   investigated based on diurnal data at 116 meteorological stations in the
   Northeast China region during 1957-2015. A total of 10 temperature
   indices divided into two categories: extremely cold and warm indices,
   were used in this study. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test was employed to
   evaluate the trend in temperature while changepoint, an R package for
   changepoint analysis, was used to detect changes in the mean levels of
   temperature extreme data series. The results of this study reveal that
   occurrence frequencies of the extreme cold night (TN10p) and extreme
   warm night (TN90p) have decreased and increased by -1.67 and
   1.79days/decade, respectively. Moreover, variations in temperature
   extremes have not been uniform with warming trends in minimum
   temperature being rapidly compared to maximum temperature extremes. The
   diurnal temperature range (DTR) depicted a remarkable decrease as a
   result of rapid warming in the minimum temperature. Warming in the
   region led to a reduction in the number of frost days (FD) and icing
   days (ID) and an increase in the number of growing season length (GSL)
   and tropical nights (Tr). Seasonally, TN10p largely decreased in winter
   and spring, while TNn and TN90p largely increased in winter and summer,
   respectively. Spatially, most of the stations with a significant warming
   trend in minimum temperatures were located in the Changbai Mountain,
   Greater Khingan Range, and Lesser Khingan Range. This implies that the
   mountainous regions are more sensitive and vulnerable to warming than
   the plain regions. On the contrary, most stations located in the Songnen
   Plain, Sanjiang Plain, and Liao River Plain displayed significant
   positive trend GSL and Tr. These climate extreme trends show that the
   region is experiencing warming which may have an impact on the
   hydrological process, ecological process, and agricultural production
   capacity.},

   or divergence?},
Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},

Abstract = {To date, no attempt has been made to assess the presence or otherwise of
   the ``Divergence Problem{''} (DP) in existing multi-millennial Southern
   Hemisphere tree-ring chronologies. We have updated the iconic Mt Read
   Huon pine chronology from Tasmania, southeastern Australia, to now
   include the warmest decade on record, AD 2000-2010, and used the Kalman
   Filter (KF) to examine it for signs of divergence against four different
   temperature series available for the region. Ring-width growth for the
   past two decades is statistically unprecedented for the past 1048 years.
   Although we have identified a decoupling between temperature and growth
   in the past two decades, the relationship between some of the
   temperature records and growth has varied over time since the start of
   instrumental records. Rather than the special case of `divergence', we
   have identified a more general time-dependence between growth and
   temperature over the last 100 years. This time-dependence appears
   particularly problematic at interdecadal time scales. Due to the
   time-dependent relationships, and uncertainties related to the climate
   data, the use of any of the individual temperature series examined here
   potentially complicates temperature reconstruction. Some of the
   uncertainty in the climate data may be associated with changing climatic
   conditions, such as the intensification of the sub-tropical ridge (STR)
   and its impact on the frequency of anticyclonic conditions over the Mt
   Read site. Increased growth at the site, particularly in the last
   decade, over and above what would be expected based on a linear
   temperature model alone, may be consistent with a number of hypotheses.
   Existing uncertainties in the climate data need to be resolved and
   independent physiological information obtained before a range of
   hypotheses for this increased growth can be effectively evaluated. (C)

Abstract = {This paper reports the results of the analysis of monthly, seasonal, and
   annual mean air temperature series from 10 meteorological stations
   distributed over Northeastern Romania for a 50-year study period
   (1961-2010). Various statistical tools were used to detect and
   characterize significant changes in these series. The Pettitt test, the
   Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT), the Buishand range test, the
   Von Neumann's ratio test have been performed on the data to test the
   series for homogeneity. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimation
   for trends detection were applied to analyze temperature data sets in
   the studied area. To explore whether some stations behave similarly or
   not and if a typology is possible from a spatial point of view, we used
   spatial hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of the Mann-Kendall
   test and Sen's slope estimation showed significant increasing trends for
   air temperature over the Northeastern part of Romania. The values of the
   statistically significant average slope varied until 0.93 degrees
   C/decade for the positive slopes and until -0.29 degrees C/decade for
   the negative slopes. The most important increase in air temperature
   trend was specific to June, July and August months when nine of the ten
   weather stations showed statistically significant positive slopes for
   all 3 months. The spatial hierarchical cluster analysis suggests the
   existence of two distinctive groups. One of them consists of stations
   located at lower elevation and the other one includes stations that are
   located at higher elevation.},

Abstract = {In analyzing daily climate data from 305 weather stations in China for
   the period from 1955 to 2000, the authors found that surface air
   temperatures are increasing with an accelerating trend after 1990. They
   also found that the daily maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) air
   temperature increased at a rate of 1.27degrees and 3.23degreesC (100
   yr)(-1) between 1955 and 2000. Both temperature trends were faster than
   those reported for the Northern Hemisphere, where T-max and T-min
   increased by 0.87degrees and 1.84degreesC (100 yr)(-1) between 1950 and
   1993. The daily temperature range (DTR) decreased rapidly by
   22.5degreesC (100 yr)(-1) from 1960 to 1990; during that time, minimum
   temperature increased while maximum temperature decreased slightly.
   Since 1990, the decline in DTR has halted because T-max and T-min
   increased at a similar pace during the 1990s. Increased minimum and
   maximum temperatures were most pronounced in northeast China and were
   lowest in the southwest. Cloud cover and precipitation correlated poorly
   with the decreasing temperature range. It is argued that a decline in
   solar irradiance better explains the decreasing range of daily
   temperatures through its influence on maximum temperature. With
   declining solar irradiance even on clear days, and with decreases in
   cloud cover, it is posited that atmospheric aerosols may be contributing
   to the changing solar irradiance and trends of daily temperatures
   observed in China.},

Abstract = {A unified statistical approach to identify suitable structural time
   series models for annual mean temperature is proposed. This includes a
   generalized model that can represent all the commonly used structural
   time series models for trend detection. the use of differenced series
   (successive year-to-year differences), and explicit methods for
   comparing the validity of no-trend nonstationary residuals models
   relative to trend models. Its application to Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change global and latitude-belt temperature series reveals that
   a linear trend model (starting in 1890, with Southern Oscillation index
   signal removal and a red noise residuals process) is the optimal model
   for much of the globe, from the Northern Hemisphere Tropics to the
   Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes, but that a random stationary increment
   process (with no deterministic trend) is preferred for the northern part
   of the Northern Hemisphere. The result for the higher northern latitudes
   appears to he related to the greater climate variability there and does
   not exclude the possibility of a trend being present. The hemispheric
   and global series will contain a mixture of the two processes but are
   dominated by and best represented by the linear trend model. The
   latitudinal detectability of trends is oppositely matched to where GCMs
   indicate greatest anthropogenic trend, that is, it is best for the
   Tropics rather than for the high latitudes. The results reinforce the
   view that the global temperatures are affected by a long-term trend that
   is not of natural origin.},

Title = {Centennial relationships between ocean temperature and Atlantic puffin

Abstract = {The current warming of the oceans has been shown to have detrimental
   effects for a number of species. An understanding of the underlying
   mechanisms may be hampered by the non-linearity and non-stationarity of
   the relationships between temperature and demography, and by the
   insufficient length of available time series. Most demographic time
   series are too short to study the effects of climate on wildlife in the
   classical sense of meteorological patterns over at least 30 years. Here
   we present a harvest time series of Atlantic puffins (Fratercula
   arctica) that goes back as far as 1880. It originates in the world's
   largest puffin colony, in southwest Iceland, which has recently
   experienced a strong decline. By estimating an annual chick production
   index for 128 years, we found prolonged periods of strong correlations
   between local sea surface temperature (SST) and chick production. The
   sign of decennial correlations switches three times during this period,
   where the phases of strong negative correlations between puffin
   productivity and SST correspond to the early 20th century Arctic warming
   period and to the most recent decades. Most of the variation (72\%) in
   chick production is explained by a model in which productivity peaks at
   an SST of 7.1 degrees C, clearly rejecting the assumption of a linear
   relationship. There is also evidence supporting non-stationarity: The
   SST at which puffins production peaked has increased by 0.24 degrees C
   during the 20th century, although the increase in average SST during the
   same period has been more than three times faster. The best supported
   models indicate that the population's decline is at least partially
   caused by the increasing SST around Iceland.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to investigate the temperature and
   snowfall trends in the cryosphere region of north-west Himalaya during
   winter season. 37 observation stations of North-West Himalaya have been
   considered for the study and these stations receive snowfall during
   winter season. The snow meteorological data period of the parameters
   maximum temperature, minimum temperature and snowfall varied from one
   observation station to other observation station between 1970 to 2011.
   Monthly and seasonal trends of these parameters during winter have been
   studied. Linear regression analysis was used for trend analysis.
   Parametric t-test was used to test the significance of the regression
   coefficient. Altitude effect in the trends of the meteorological
   parameters has been noticed. It was observed that more than 75\% of the
   observation stations in the altitude range <4000 m a.s.l. showed
   increasing trend in maximum temperature and minimum temperature during
   winter season, out of which around 25\% trends were statistically
   significant. Most of the observation stations in the altitude range >
   4000 m showed decreasing trend of maximum and minimum temperature.
   Decreasing snowfall trend was observed at most of the stations in the
   altitude range < 4000 m out of which around 20\% trends were
   statistically significant. Significant decrease in snowfall was observed
   for the months March and April below 4000 m altitude.},

Abstract = {A new ensemble model was introduced and evaluated for projecting minimum
   and maximum temperatures in Iran.Trends in minimum and maximum
   temperatures in the near term (2021-2040) were obtained using
   socio-economic scenarios of five models at 95 synoptic stations.The
   ensemble technique reduced the error of the models used in projection to
   an optimal extent.
   In climate science, ensemble modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for
   addressing the uncertainties inherent in individual climate models. This
   approach generates more robust and reliable predictions by harnessing
   the collective insights of multiple models. Nonetheless, the method of
   combining these models to derive an ensemble model remains an open
   question. To this end, the objectives of this research are twofold: (i)
   to introduce and evaluate the weighted average-correlation ensemble
   model for projecting minimum and maximum temperatures in Iran, and (ii)
   to assess near-term (2021-2040) trends across 95 synoptic stations using
   socio-economic scenarios derived from five models: GFDL-ESM4,
   MPI-ESM1-2-HR, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MRI-ESM2, and UKESM1-0-LL. The ensemble
   technique effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (1/3 -
   1/10) associated with the individual models. The predicted values for
   the minimum temperature are more similar to the actual data than the
   maximum temperature. The results also indicate a significant increase in
   the minimum temperature compared to the maximum temperature during the
   base period. The distribution of the maximum temperature across the
   country is influenced mainly by its latitude. In contrast, the
   distribution of the minimum temperature is influenced by both the
   country's major altitudes and latitudes. Surveys also indicate that,
   compared to the base period, there is an increasing trend in temperature
   for winter, spring, and autumn, while a decrease is observed during the
   summer. Notably, the increase in temperature is more pronounced during
   winter.},

Abstract = {Liquid porosimetry experiments reveal a peculiar trend of the intrusion
   pressure of water in hydrophobic Cu-2(3,3 `,5,5 `-tetraethyl-4,4
   `-bipyrazolate) MOF. At lower temperature (T) range, the intrusion
   pressure (P-i) increases with T. For higher T values, P-i first reaches
   a maximum and then decreases. This is at odds with the Young-Laplace
   law, which for systems showing a continuous decrease of contact angle
   with T predicts a corresponding reduction of the intrusion pressure.
   Though the Young-Laplace law is not expected to provide quantitative
   predictions at the subnanoscale of Cu-2(tebpz) pores, the physical
   intuition suggests that to a reduction of their hydrophobicity
   corresponds a reduction of the P-i. Molecular dynamics simulations and
   sychrothron experiments allowed to clarify the mechanism of the peculiar
   trend of P-i with T. At increasing temperatures the vapor density within
   the MOF' pores grows significantly, bringing the corresponding partial
   pressure to approximate to 5 MPa. This pressure, which is consistent
   with the shift of P-i observed in liquid porosimetry, represents a
   threshold to be overcame before intrusion takes place. Beyond some value
   of temperature, the phenomenon of reduction of hydrophobicity (and water
   surface tension) dominated over the opposite effect of increase of vapor
   pressure and P-i inverts its trend with T.},

   feature of changes in annual mean extremes (T-max, T-min) and T-avg at
   Mount Sniezka is an upward trend. The increase of T-min (0.148 degrees
   C/10 years) has been twice as fast as that for T-max (0.069 degrees C/10
   years). A strong correlation (almost 1.0) was found between the mean
   annual Wolf number for twenty-two-year cycles of magnetic changes in the
   Sun and 1988. During the 1989-2012 cycle, there was a strong increase in

Abstract = {This study examines the projected characteristics of mean temperature
   (T-mean), maximum temperature (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) in
   China during 2006-2100 from simulations of MPI-ESM-LR model within the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Periods of
   2011-2040 and 2061-2090 are concentrated on the analysis under the three
   representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: a high emission
   scenario (RCP8.5), a midrange mitigation emission scenario (RCP4.5), and
   a low emission scenario (RCP2.6). Under RCP8.5, the T-mean, T-max and
   T-min, show pronounced warming with the annual rates of 0.43 degrees
   C/decade, 0.42 degrees C/decade, 0.45 degrees C/decade during 2011-2040,
   and 0.72 degrees C/decade, 0.70 degrees C/decade, 0.76 degrees C/decade
   during 2061-2090, which pronouncedly contributed by winter. Under
   RCP4.5, the T-mean, T-max and T-min display consistent increases during
   2011-2040 with the trends of 0.29 degrees C/decade, 0.29 degrees
   C/decade, 0.30 degrees C/decade on the annual basis, respectively, and
   the increases calm down for T-mean, T-max and T-min up to 0.14 degrees
   C/decade during 2061-2090. Under RCP2.6, the T-mean, T-max and T-min
   demonstrate positive trends during 2011-2040 with the annual rates of
   0.26 degrees C/decade, 0.28 degrees C/decade, 0.25 degrees C/decade,
   respectively, and turn to negative afterwards. Moreover, the annual and
   seasonal T-mean, T-max and T-min are in agreement with the concentration
   of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and reflect the variability of the
   radiative forcing trajectories in the RCP. For the spatial patterns, the
   northeastern China and the Tibetan Plateau are more sensitive and
   susceptible to climate change in future emission scenarios. It fails to
   capture the asymmetric trends for T-max and T-min projections, which do
   exist in the observations on the regional and global scales. This
   suggests that the projections have uncertainties in the models, and an
   understanding of causes is essential to improve the accuracies. (C) 2013

Abstract = {In the present study, the research was focused on analyzing long-term
   trends and variability of annual and seasonal air mean temperatures and
   some parameters related to cold and hot extreme temperatures, based on
   relevant continuous temperature data (1961-2018 period) provided by
   three regional weather stations (Cluj-Napoca, Deva and Miercurea-Ciuc).
   The Mann-Kendall test was used in order to find
   statistically-significant trends, while the magnitude of trends was
   estimated using Sen's slope estimator method. The main results showed a
   significant increase of mean air temperature, especially in the summer
   season and for indicators related to hot extreme temperatures.
   Generally, our findings are consistent with the current global warming
   and previous study results on temperature variability in Romania. Anyway
   by comparing our results with those from the other similar studies
   performed in Romania, it could be observed that the climate became
   warmer in the study area, so the trend in annual mean and seasonal air
   temperature has intensified and statistical significance of the results
   has significantly increased. Also, the intensification of the ``urban
   heat island'' effect could be highlighted in the larger cities, like
   Cluj-Napoca. This increasing trend entails significant impacts on
   society, economy and natural ecosystems, which is expected to intensify
   in the near future.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies analyze the temperature variations in the Mediterranean
   area due to the anticipated impact of climate change in this part of the
   world. A number of studies examined the temperature climate in Greece,
   but few are based on a large number of synoptic stations covering all
   regions and climatic zones and even fewer are based on homogenized data
   set series, despite the fact that climatological studies must use
   high-quality homogeneous data series. The present work reviews previous
   studies dealing with climatic changes in Greece and addresses changes of
   mean air temperature, based on a large set of homogenized data from 52
   synoptic stations. A statistically significant negative trend during
   1960-1976 and a positive one during 1977-2004 were revealed. During
   1960-1976, the lowest negative annual temperature trend is observed in
   Crete. During 1977-2004, the northern region of Greece was characterized
   by prominent annual warming, whereas the north and central Aegean Sea
   and the semi-mountainous area were characterized by the lowest warming.
   All stations are characterized by high seasonal trends in summer; the
   most extreme trends are observed in the northern and eastern regions and
   in the Attica area. Positive temperature trends occur from May to
   October, while negative trends dominate from November to February. The
   most pronounced warming is recorded in June and July, and the most
   strongly decreasing trend occurs in November. Annual temperature trends
   in northern Greece follow the hemispheric pattern, and the overall
   summer warming in Greece is greater than the hemisphere's.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the mean annual and seasonal temperatures from 30
   meteorological stations in the Jinsha River Basin (JRB) from 1961 to
   2008, the temperature trends are analyzed by using Mann-Kendall test and
   linear trend analysis. There is an increasing trend in mean annual and
   seasonal temperatures during this period, and the increasing trends in
   winter seem more significant than those in the other three seasons. The
   mean annual temperature has increased by 0.0158A degrees C/year during
   the last 48 years. There are more than 70\% of stations exhibiting
   increasing trends for annual and seasonal temperatures. The increasing
   trends in the headwater and upper reaches are more dominant than those
   in the middle and lower reaches. The largest increase magnitude occurred
   in the low temperature area, while the largest decrease magnitude
   occurred in the high temperature area. The decreasing trends are mainly
   characterized for the maximum temperature time series, and summer is the
   only season showing a slight and insignificant increasing trend. All the
   time series showed a statistically significant increasing trend at the
   level of alpha = 0.05 for the minimum temperature time series. As a
   whole, the increasing magnitude of the minimum temperature is
   significantly greater than the decreasing magnitude of the maximum
   temperature.},

Title = {Error Structure and Atmospheric Temperature Trends in Observations from
   the Microwave Sounding Unit},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {22},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1661-1681},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) onboard the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration polar-orbiting satellites measures the
   atmospheric temperature from the surface to the lower stratosphere under
   all weather conditions, excluding precipitation. Although designed
   primarily for monitoring weather processes, the MSU observations have
   been extensively used for detecting climate trends, and calibration
   errors are a major source of uncertainty. To reduce this uncertainty, an
   intercalibration method based on the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO)
   matchups for the MSU instruments on satellites NOAA-10, -11, -12, and
   -14 was developed. Due to orbital geometry, the SNO matchups are
   confined to the polar regions, where the brightness temperature range is
   slightly smaller than the global range. Nevertheless, the resulting
   calibration coefficients are applied globally to the entire life cycle
   of an MSU satellite.
   Such intercalibration reduces intersatellite biases by an order of
   magnitude compared to prelaunch calibration and, thus, results in
   well-merged time series for the MSU channels 2, 3, and 4, which
   respectively represent the deep layer temperature of themidtroposphere
   (T-2), tropopause (T-3), and lower stratosphere (T-4). Focusing on the
   global atmosphere over ocean surfaces, trends for the SNO-calibrated
   T-2, T-3, and T-4 are, respectively, 0.21 +/- 0.07, 0.08 +/- 0.08, and
   -0.38 +/- 0.27 K decade (-1) from 1987 to 2006. These trends are
   independent of the number of limb-corrected footprints used in the
   dataset, and trend differences are marginal for varying bias correction
   techniques for merging the overlapping satellites on top of the SNO
   calibration.
   The spatial pattern of the trends reveals the tropical midtroposphere to
   have warmed at a rate of 0.28 +/- 0.19 K decade (-1), while the Arctic
   atmosphere warmed 2 to 3 times faster than the global average. The
   troposphere and lower stratosphere, however, cooled across the southern
   Indian and Atlantic Oceans adjacent to the Antarctic continent. To
   remove the stratospheric cooling effect in T-2, channel trends from T-2
   and T-3 (T-23) and T-2 and T-4 (T-24) were combined. The trend patterns
   for T-23 and T-24 are in close agreement, suggesting internal
   consistencies for the trend patterns of the three channels.},

Title = {Climate Variability of Air Temperature and Its Warming Trends in the
   Arabian Gulf},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Over a 41-year period (1979-2019), the climate of the Arabian Gulf
   (Gulf) exhibited notable variability. This variation, influenced by
   mesoscale and globalscale meteorological and climatic determinants,
   showed temperature fluctuations, predominantly in the Northern Gulf (N
   Gulf). The N Gulf recorded an average temperature of 25.9 degrees C, a
   noticeable 3 degrees C higher than the broader Gulf average. This period
   marked extreme temperature records, with a peak at 53.8 degrees C in
   July 2016, paralleling the highest known temperatures in Asia. Data
   reveals a warming trend (0.1-0.6 degrees C per decade) in the region,
   with the N Gulf's rise surpassing global trends. The years 2014-2019
   were notably warmer, impacting overall trends, and 1997 was the
   transitional year shifting from cooler to warmer climates. The N Gulf's
   seasonal dynamics are also transforming, with extended summers and
   shortened winters. In this study, we employed empirical orthogonal
   function (EOF) decomposition analysis to examine the interannual to
   multidecadal fluctuations in air temperature within the Gulf from 1979
   to 2019, using hourly air temperature data from the Watch Forcing
   Dataset (WFDE5) generated from the fifth generation (ERA5) European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Fore-casts (ECMWF). Through this method,
   we discerned three principal EOF modes, which together accounted for
   82\% of the air temperature variability in the Gulf, highlighting
   external influences such as North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
   (AMO). The data for these external influences were sourced from the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Physical Sciences
   Laboratory. These findings stress the pressing need for detailed climate
   studies and mitigation strategies for a rapidly warming Gulf region,
   especially the N Gulf.},

Title = {Elevation dependency of temperature trend over the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau during 1901-2015},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {290},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Q-TP hereafter) has experienced dramatic
   warming in recent decades, resulting in severe effects on the ecosystems
   and downstream. However, none of previous studies investigated
   elevationdependency temperature trend with the high resolution over the
   long-term period. Based on monthly temperature dataset with 0.1
   developed by generative adversarial network, elevation-dependency
   temperature trend over the Q-TP and 5 climate zones (humid,
   humid-semihumid, semihumid, semiarid, arid region) during 1901-1946,
   1946-1965, 1965-1997 and 1997-2015 are investigated. Snow cover (SNC),
   high cloud cover (HCC), middle cloud cover (MCC), specific humidity
   (SHUM) and soil moisture content (SOILM) are introduced to analyze
   possible mechanism. There are 4 cases of elevation-dependency
   temperature trend, which are positive/negative elevation-dependency
   warming (EDW+/EDW-) and cooling (EDC+/EDC-). These patterns (EDW+, EDW-,
   EDC+ and EDC-) are identified as warming/cooling trends that become
   stronger/weaker with increasing elevation. EDW- signal is found during
   1901-1946 due to the influence of SOILM. The most prominent EDW- signal
   occurs over the arid region. EDC+/- is presented during 1946-1965 under
   the dominance of SHUM and SOILM. The stronger EDC signal is shown over
   the arid and semiarid region than over the humidsemihumid region. The
   subtle EDW+ signal is shown over the semihumid, semiarid and arid
   regions during 1965-1997 when SOILM has a relatively large contribution
   to temperature trend. The robust EDW+ signal is exhibited from 1997 to
   2015 when SNC plays a vital role in regulating the temperature change.
   There is a more significant EDW+ over the humid, humid-semihumid, and
   semihumid regions than that over the semiarid and arid regions during
   this period. Above all, SNC, SHUM and SOILM are found to be the primary
   contributors to elevation-dependency temperature trend. SOILM and SHUM
   are associated with hydrological effects and control temperature
   variations over the Q-TP during 1901-1997. SNC is related to
   snow/ice-albedo feedback and dominates temperature variations over the
   Q-TP during 1997-2015.},

Abstract = {While the changes in air temperature under climate change and
   urbanization have been extensively examined in the literature, little is
   known about how human-perceived temperatures change. This study
   investigates the long-term changes in human-perceived temperatures
   (e.g., summer heat stress and winter wind chill conditions) over South
   China and quantifies the possible effects of urbanization. Daily
   observations at 86 stations during the period of 1961-2014 are collected
   and analyzed. Analysis results show that heat stress and wind chill
   temperature increase faster than air temperatures (i.e., daily mean,
   maximum, and minimum temperatures), and these increases are stronger in
   winter than in summer. The probabilities of hot extremes increase
   throughout the study period, whereas those of cold extremes decrease.
   Compared with those in non-urban areas, the warming trend in both
   seasons and the increase (decrease) in hot (cold) extremes are even more
   substantial in highly developed urban areas, such as the Pearl River
   Delta, indicating a remarkable effect of urbanization. it is estimated
   that urbanization contributes as much as half of the warming trend in
   summer and around one-third of the trend in winter. These results are
   helpful for mitigating climate change and reducing the impacts of
   extreme events.},

Abstract = {Though many studies have focused on the causes of shifts in trend of
   temperature, whether the response of vegetation growth to temperature
   has changed is still not very clear. In this study, we analyzed the
   spatial features of the trend changes of temperature during the growing
   season and the response of vegetation growth in China based on observed
   climatic data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from
   1984 to 2011. An obvious warming to cooling shift during growing season
   from the period 1984-1997 to the period 1998-2011 was identified in the
   northern and northeastern regions of China, whereas a totally converse
   shift was observed in the southern and western regions, suggesting large
   spatial heterogeneity of changes of the trend of growing season
   temperature throughout China. China as a whole, a significant positive
   relationship between vegetation growth and temperature during 1984 to
   1997 has been greatly weakened during 1998-2011. This change of response
   of vegetation growth to temperature has also been confirmed by Granger
   causality test. On regional scales, obvious shifts in relationship
   between vegetation growth and temperature were identified in temperate
   desert region and rainforest region. Furthermore, by comprehensively
   analyzing of the relationship between NDVI and climate variables, an
   overall reduction of impacts of climate factors on vegetation growth was
   identified over China during recent years, indicating enhanced
   influences from human associated activities.},

   Analysing the entire sample period (from 1880m1 to 2022m10), the results
   indicate lower degrees of persistence and more acute trends in northern
   hemisphere temperatures. We also observe some degree of persistence and
   a positive trend for the differenced series. Finally, observing the
   evolution of these two factors over the last 50 years, we see that in
   northern temperatures, both the degree of persistence and the time trend
   have increased over time, whereas similar increases were not observed in
   southern temperatures.},

Abstract = {Identifying and separating the signal of urbanization effects in current
   temperature data series is essential for accurately detecting,
   attributing, and projecting mean and extreme temperature change on
   varied spatial scales. This paper proposes a new method based on machine
   learning to classify the observational stations into rural stations and
   urban stations. Based on the classification of rural and urban stations,
   the global and regional land annual mean and extreme temperature indices
   series over 1951-2018 for all stations and rural stations were
   calculated, and the urbanization effects and the urbanization
   contribution of global land annual mean and extreme temperature indices
   series are quantitatively evaluated using the difference series between
   all stations and the rural stations. The results showed that the global
   land annual mean time series for mean temperature and most extreme
   temperature indices experienced statistically significant urbanization
   effects. The urbanization effects in the mean and extreme temperature
   indices series generally occurred after the mid-1980s, and there were
   significant differences of the magnitudes of urbanization effects among
   different regions. The urbanization effect on the trends of annual mean
   and extreme temperature indices series in East Asia is generally the
   strongest, which is consistent with the rapidly urbanization process in
   the region over the past decades, but it is generally small in Europe
   during the recent decades.},

Abstract = {This study was designed to identify trends in maximum, minimum, and
   average air temperatures in the Federal District of Brazil from 1980 to
   2010, measured at five weather stations. Three statistical tests
   (Wald-Wolfowitz, Cox-Stuart, and Mann-Kendall) were tested for their
   applicability for this purpose, and the ones found to be most suitable
   for the data series were validated. For this data sample, it was
   observed that the application of the Wald-Wolfowitz test and its
   validation by the Cox-Stuart and Mann-Kendall tests was the best
   solution for analyzing the air temperature trends. The results showed an
   upward trend in average and maximum air temperature at three weather
   stations, a downward trend at one, and the absence of any trend at two.
   If the trend of increasing air temperature in the Federal District
   persists, it could have a negative impact on various sectors of society,
   mainly on the health of the population, especially during the dry season
   when more cases of respiratory diseases are registered. These results
   could serve as inputs for public administrators involved in the planning
   and formulation of public policies.},

Abstract = {Longer-term externally forced trends in global mean surface temperatures
   (GMSTs) are embedded in the background noise of internally generated
   multidecadal variability(1). A key mode of internal variability is the
   Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which contributed to a reduced
   GMST trend during the early 2000s(1-3). We use a novel, physical
   phenomenon-based approach to quantify the contribution from a source of
   internally generated multidecadal variability-the IPO-to multidecadal
   GMST trends. Here we show that the largest IPO contributions occurred in
   its positive phase during the rapidwarming periods from 1910-1941 and
   1971-1995, with the IPO contributing 71\% and 75\%, respectively, to the
   difference between the median values of the externally forced trends and
   observed trends. The IPO transition from positive to negative in the
   late-1990s contributed 27\% of the discrepancy between model median
   estimates of the forced part of the GMST trend and the observed trend
   from 1995 to 2013, with additional contributions that are probably due
   to internal variability outside of the Pacific(4) and an externally
   forced response from small volcanic eruptions(5). Understanding and
   quantifying the contribution of a specific source of internally
   generated variability-the IPO-to GMST trends is necessary to improve
   decadal climate prediction skill.},

Abstract = {Based on the daily maximum air temperature data from 176 stations in
   India from 1969 to 2013, the climatological distribution of the number
   of days with high temperature (HT) defined as days with maximum
   temperature higher than 37 degrees C during summer season (March-June)
   are studied. With a focus on the regional variability and long-term
   trends, the impacts of HT days are examined by dividing the country into
   six geographical regions (North, West, North-central, East,
   South-central and South). Although the long-term (1969-2013)
   climatological numbers of HT days display well-defined spatial patterns,
   there is clear change in climatological mean and coefficient of
   variation of HT days in a recent period (1991-2013). The long period
   trends indicate increase in summer HT days by 3\%, 5\%, and 18\% in
   north, west, and south regions, respectively and decrease by 4\% and 9\%
   in north-central and east regions respectively. However, spatial
   variations in HT days exist across different regions in the country. The
   data analysis shows that 2010 was the warmest summer year and 2013 was
   the coolest summer year in India. Comparison of spatial distributions of
   trends in HT days for 1969-1990 and 1991-2013 periods reveal that there
   is an abrupt increase in the number of HT days over north, west and
   north-central regions of India probably from mid 1990s. A steep increase
   in summer HT days in highly populated cities of Mumbai, New Delhi,
   Chennai, Jaipur, and Visakhapatnam is noticed during the recent period
   of 1991-2013. The summer HT days over southern India indicate
   significant positive correlation with Nino 3.4 index for three months'
   running mean (December-January-February, January-March, February-April,
   March-May and April-June).},

Abstract = {Meteorological variables trend analysis, on different spatial and
   temporal scales, has been of great concern during the past century
   because of the attention paid from the scientific community to global
   climate change. According to some recent studies, the southern areas of
   Italy are suffering strengthening drought conditions. The aim of this
   study is to analyse temperature time series, detecting potential trends
   and assessing their significance and magnitude. For this purpose about
   62 gauged stations, mainly located within the Campania region, Southern
   Italy, have been analysed for the period 1924-1999. Statistical analysis
   of the database highlight that: (i) trend appears predominantly
   positive, both at the annual and seasonal scale (ii) at the annual scale
   positive trends are significant for 34 \% of total stations, (iii)
   significant positive and negative trend average magnitude appear rather
   severe, ranging from -1.5 degrees C/decade to +0.85 degrees C/decade
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Regional surface temperature trends from phase 3 of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) and CMIP5 twentieth-century runs are
   compared with observationsat spatial scales ranging from global averages
   to individual grid pointsusing simulated intrinsic climate variability
   from preindustrial control runs to assess whether observed trends are
   detectable and/or consistent with the models' historical run trends. The
   CMIP5 models are also used to detect anthropogenic components of the
   observed trends, by assessing alternative hypotheses based on scenarios
   driven with either anthropogenic plus natural forcings combined, or with
   natural forcings only. Modeled variability is assessed via inspection of
   control run time series, standard deviation maps, spectral analyses, and
   low-frequency variance consistency tests. The models are found to
   provide plausible representations of internal climate variability,
   although there is room for improvement. The influence of observational
   uncertainty on the trends is assessed and is found to be generally small
   in comparison with intrinsic climate variability. Observed temperature
   trends over 1901-2010 are found to contain detectable anthropogenic
   warming components over a large fraction (about 80\%) of the analyzed
   global area. In about 70\% of the analyzed area, the modeled warming is
   consistent with the observed trends; in about 10\% it is significantly
   greater than simulated. Regions without detectable warming include the
   high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean, the eastern United States, and parts
   of the eastern and northern Pacific Ocean. For 1981-2010, the observed
   warming trends over only about 30\% of the globe are found to contain a
   detectable anthropogenic warming: this includes a number of regions
   within about 40 degrees-45 degrees of the equator, particularly in the
   Indian Ocean, western Pacific, South Asia, and tropical Atlantic.},

Title = {Secular temperature trends for the southern Rocky Mountains over the
   last five centuries},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Pre-instrumental surface temperature variability in the Southwestern
   United States has traditionally been reconstructed using variations in
   the annual ring widths of high altitude trees that live near a
   growth-limiting isotherm. A number of studies have suggested that the
   response of some trees to temperature variations is non-stationary,
   warranting the development of alternative approaches towards
   reconstructing past regional temperature variability. Here we present a
   five-century temperature reconstruction for a high-altitude site in the
   Rocky Mountains derived from the oxygen isotopic composition of
   cellulose (delta O-18(c)) from Bristlecone Pine trees. The record is
   independent of the co-located growth-based reconstruction while
   providing the same temporal resolution and absolute age constraints. The
   empirical correlation between delta O-18(c) and instrumental
   temperatures is used to produce a temperature transfer function. A
   forward-model for cellulose isotope variations, driven by meteorological
   data and output from an isotope-enabled General Circulation Model, is
   used to evaluate the processes that propagate the temperature signal to
   the proxy. The cellulose record documents persistent multidecadal
   variations in delta O-18(c) that are attributable to temperature shifts
   on the order of 1 degrees C but no sustained monotonic rise in
   temperature or a step-like increase since the late 19th century. The
   isotope-based temperature history is consistent with both regional wood
   density-based temperature estimates and some sparse early instrumental
   records. Citation: Berkelhammer, M., and L. D. Stott (2012), Secular

Title = {Surface Water Vapor Pressure and Temperature Trends in North America

Abstract = {Over one-quarter billion hourly values of temperature and relative
   humidity observed at 309 stations located across North America during
   1948-2010 were studied. The water vapor pressure was determined and
   seasonal averages were computed. Data were first examined for
   inhomogeneities using a statistical test to determine whether the data
   were fit better to a straight line or a straight line plus an abrupt
   step, which may arise from changes in instruments and/or procedure.
   Trends were then found for data not having discontinuities.
   Statistically significant warming trends affecting the Midwestern United
   States, Canadian prairies, and the western Arctic are evident in winter
   and to a lesser extent in spring while statistically significant
   increases in water vapor pressure occur primarily in summer for some
   stations in the eastern half of the United States. The temperature
   (water vapor pressure) trends averaged over all stations were 0.30
   (0.07), 0.24 (0.06), 0.13 (0.11), 0.11 (0.07) degrees C decade(-1) (hPa
   decade(-1)) in the winter, spring, summer, and autumn seasons,
   respectively. The averages of these seasonal trends are 0.20 degrees C
   decade(-1) and 0.07 hPa decade(-1), which correspond to a specific
   humidity increase of 0.04 g kg(-1) decade(-1) and a relative humidity
   reduction of 0.5\% decade(-1)},

Title = {Potential consequences for rising temperature trends in the Oti River
   Basin, West Africa},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {IntroductionOne of the ways that climate change manifest itself is
   through temperature changes. Though the Oti River basin has been
   grappling with drought incidents, there has been little or no emphasis
   on analyzing temperature fluctuations in the basin. This study aimed to
   analyze the mean annual and seasonal temperature for the observed
   (1981-2010) and future periods (2021-2050) over the Oti River basin.
   MethodsHistorical data were obtained from meteorological stations and
   the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Prediction of
   Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA POWER). Data quality assessment was
   conducted, and the NASA POWER temperature was validated against the
   stations' temperature. Ensemble of eight models acquired from the
   Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX-Africa)
   under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5),
   were used for the future projection. The mean annual and seasonal
   temperatures were analyzed for 1981-2010 and 2021-2050 (under RCPs 4.5
   and 8.5 scenarios). The Modified Mann-Kendall test was used for trend
   analysis at 5\% significant level. Results and discussionIn the
   near-future, temperature is anticipated to increase at the mean monthly
   scale in the ranges of +0.88 \& DEG;C in October to +2.65 \& DEG;C in
   January under the RCP4.5 scenario, while the RCP8.5 predicts increases
   between +2.71 \& DEG;C in July and +6.48 \& DEG;C in January. The annual
   mean temperature change for the entire basin is projected at +1.47 \&
   DEG;C (RCP4.5) and +4.2 \& DEG;C (RCP8.5). For the rainy season period,
   the RCP4.5 projects annual mean temperature changes in the ranges of
   -0.72 \& DEG;C and +1.52 \& DEG;C while the RCP8.5 predicts changes
   between +1.06 \& DEG;C and +4.45 \& DEG;C. Concerning the dry season
   period, the anticipated changes in the annual mean temperature under the
   RCP4.5 would range from -0.43 \& DEG;C to +2.78 \& DEG;C whereas that of
   RCP8.5 would be between +1.97 \& DEG;C and 7.25 \& DEG;C. The Modified
   Mann-Kendall test revealed significantly increasing trends for
   temperature projections in the basin under both the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 in
   the basin. The study provides significant contribution to the
   comprehension of temperature patterns in time and space which is
   necessary for the sustenance of rainfed agriculture and water resources
   within the basin.},

Abstract = {Strongly correlated changes between the amplitude of the seasonal cycle
   in temperature and the annual mean evaporative fraction indicate
   long-term drying in the Amazon, according to climate reanalyses and
   Earth System Model projections.
   Earth System Models project a wide range of rainfall changes in the
   Amazon rainforest, and hence changes in soil moisture and
   evapotranspiration. Hydrological changes are heterogeneous, meaning
   local measurements are too sparse to constrain projections of
   large-scale hydrological change. Here we show that changes in the
   amplitude of the temperature seasonal cycle are strongly correlated with
   annual mean evaporative fraction (surface latent heat flux as a fraction
   of surface net radiation) changes, across reanalyses and Earth System
   Model projections. We find an increase in annual temperature amplitude
   of 1 degrees C is associated with a reduction in evaporative fraction of
   up to 0.04. The observed temperature seasonal cycle amplitude increase
   (0.4 degrees C) over the last three decades implies Amazon drying,
   determined in the absence of soil or energy flux measurements, matches
   Earth System Model simulations of the recent past. Additionally, Earth
   System Models predict further temperature seasonal cycle amplitude
   increases, suggesting drying will continue with future climate change.},

Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Satellite-derived lake surface water temperature (LSWT) measurements can
   be used for monitoring purposes. However, analyses based on the LSWT of
   Lake Ontario and the surrounding land surface temperature (LST) are
   scarce in the current literature. First, we provide an evaluation of the
   commonly used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS)-derived LSWT/LST (MOD11A1 and MYD11A1) using in situ
   measurements near the area of where Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence River
   and the Rideau Canal meet. The MODIS datasets agreed well with ground
   sites measurements from 2015-2017, with an R-2 consistently over 0.90.
   Among the different ground measurement sites, the best results were
   achieved for Hill Island, with a correlation of 0.99 and centered root
   mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.73 K for Aqua/MYD nighttime. The
   validated MODIS datasets were used to analyze the temperature trend over
   the study area from 2001 to 2018, through a linear regression method
   with a Mann-Kendall test. A slight warming trend was found, with 95\%
   confidence over the ground sites from 2003 to 2012 for the MYD11A1-Night
   datasets. The warming trend for the whole region, including both the
   lake and the land, was about 0.17 K year(-1) for the MYD11A1 datasets
   during 2003-2012, whereas it was about 0.06 K year(-1) during 2003-2018.
   There was also a spatial pattern of warming, but the trend for the lake
   region was not obviously different from that of the land region. For the
   monthly trends, the warming trends for September and October from 2013
   to 2018 are much more apparent than those of other months.},

Abstract = {The effect of atmospheric circulation on monthly, seasonal and annual
   mean surface air temperature trends in the years 1979-2018 is studied by
   applying a trajectory-based method on the European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 reanalysis data. To the extent that
   the method captures the effects of atmospheric circulation, the results
   suggest that circulation trends only had a minor impact on observed
   annual mean temperature trends in most areas. Exceptions include, for
   example, a decrease in annual mean warming by about 1 degrees C in
   western Siberia, and increased warming in central Europe and the Arctic
   Ocean. However, the effect of circulation trends on seasonal and
   particularly monthly temperature trends is more substantial. Subtracting
   the effect of circulation changes from the ERA5 temperature trends
   leaves residual trends with a smoother annual cycle than the original
   trends. The residual monthly mean temperature trends also tend to agree
   better with the multi-model mean temperature trends from models in the
   5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) than the original ERA5
   trends do, with a 42\% decrease in the mean square difference over the
   global land area. However, the corresponding decrease in the mean square
   difference of the annual mean temperature trends is only 6\%.},

Abstract = {Temperature is one of the important climatological factors which affects
   the hydrological processes in a watershed, and is commonly used to
   investigate the change of climate. The distribution and trend of annual
   and seasonal mean temperature for 44 meteorological stations in Qilian
   Mountains over a period of 1960 to 2017 were analyzed by using linear
   regression. The mean annual temperature ranges from -2.8 to 9.7 degrees
   C, and is above 0 degrees C below middle mountains. However, the mean
   temperature of summer is maximum above 43.1 degrees C, and is minimum in
   winter below -41.6 degrees C. Vertical of mean annual temperature is
   distributed significantly. The distribution of mean annual temperature
   is higher in northern slope than in southern, and higher in northwest
   than in southeast. The warming trend is very strong in winter, and has a
   certain dependence on the altitude above the 37.5 degrees of northern
   latitude, which is different in different seasons. The result of the
   present research would be helpful to promote ecological protection,
   adjustment of agricultural structure, and management of water resources
   in the Qilian Mountains.},

Abstract = {By characterizing the patterns of temperature extremes over nine
   integrated agricultural regions (IARs) in China from 1961 to 2011, this
   study performed trend analyses on 16 extreme temperature indices using a
   high-resolution (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees) daily gridded dataset and
   the Mann-Kendall method. The results show that annually, at both daytime
   and nighttime, cold extremes significantly decreased but warm extremes
   significantly increased across all IARs. Overall, nighttimes tended to
   warm faster than daytimes. Diurnal temperature ranges (DTR) diminished,
   apart from the mid-northern Southwest China Region and the mid-Loess
   Plateau Region. Seasonally, DTR widely diminished across all IARs during
   the four seasons except for spring. Higher minimum daily minimum
   temperature (TNn) and maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx), in both
   summer and winter, were recorded for most IARs except for the
   Huang-Huai-Hai Region; in autumn, all IARs generally encountered higher
   TNn and TXx. In all seasons, warming was observed at daytime and
   nighttime but, again, nighttimes warmed faster than daytimes. The
   results also indicate a more rapid warming trend in Northern and Western
   China than in Southern and Eastern China, with accelerated warming at
   high elevations. The increases in TNn and TXx might cause a reduction in
   agriculture yield in spring over Northern China, while such negative
   impact might occur in Southern China during summer. In autumn and
   winter, however, the negative impact possibly occurred in most of the
   IARs. Moreover, increased TXx in the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River
   Delta is possibly related to rapid local urbanization. Climatically, the
   general increase in temperature extremes across Chinese IARs may be
   induced by strengthened Northern Hemisphere Subtropical High or weakened
   Northern Hemisphere Polar Vortex.},

   incidence of warm extremes has been increasing in most parts of China,
   while the opposite trend was found in the cold extremes for summer and
   winter months. Both increasing and decreasing trends of monthly DTR
   extremes were identified in China for both seasons. For high DTR
   extremes, decreasing trends were identified in northern China for both
   seasons, but increasing trends were found only in southern China in
   summer, while in winter, they were found in central China. Monthly low

Abstract = {Trends in the frequencies of four temperature extremes (the occurrence
   of warm clays, cold clays, warm nights and cold nights) with respect to
   a modulated annual cycle (MAC), and those associated exclusively with
   weather-intraseasonal fluctuations (WIF) in eastern China were
   investigated based on an updated homogenized daily maximum and minimum
   temperature dataset for 1960-2008. The Ensemble Empirical Mode
   Decomposition (EEMD) method was used to isolate the WIF, MAC, and
   longer-term components from the temperature series. The annual, winter
   and summer occurrences of warm (cold) nights were found to have
   increased (decreased) significantly almost everywhere, while those of
   warm (cold) days have increased (decreased) in northern China (north of
   40 degrees N). However, the four temperature extremes associated
   exclusively with WIF for winter have decreased almost everywhere, while
   those for summer have decreased in the north but increased in the south.
   These characteristics agree with changes in the amplitude of WIF. in
   particular, winter WIF of maximum temperature tended to weaken almost
   everywhere, especially in eastern coastal areas (by 10\%-20\%); summer
   WIF tended to intensify in southern China by 10\%-20\%. It is notable
   that in northern China, the occurrence of warm clays has increased, even
   where that associated with WIF has decreased significantly. This
   suggests that the recent increasing frequency of warm extremes is due to
   a considerable rise in the mean temperature level, which surpasses the
   effect of the weakening weather fluctuations in northern China.},

Abstract = {The spatial analysis of annual and seasonal temperature trends in Serbia
   during the period 1961-2010 was carried out using mean monthly data from
   64 meteorological stations. Change year detection was achieved using
   cumulative sum charts. The magnitude of trends was derived from the
   slopes of linear trends using the least square method. The same
   formalism of least square method was used to assess the statistical
   significance of the determined trends. Maps of temperature trends were
   generated by applying a spatial regression method to visualize the
   detected tendencies. The obtained results indicate a negative
   temperature trend for the period before the change year except for
   winter and a more pronounced positive trend after the change year.
   Besides being more pronounced, the vast majority of trends after the
   change year were also clearly statistically significant. Our estimate of
   the average temperature trend over Serbia is in agreement with those
   obtained at the global and European scale. Calculated global
   autocorrelation statistics (Moran's I) indicate an apparent random
   spatial pattern of temperature trends across the Serbia for both periods
   before and after the change year.},

Abstract = {Instrumental time series are often affected by inhomogeneities which can
   mask or amplify climate change signals. Various procedures for the
   detection and adjustment of breaks exist for monthly and annual time
   series. Homogenization methods on a daily basis are scarce and often
   disregard uncertainties accompanying the break adjustment. We present a
   complete homogenization procedure for daily extreme temperature series
   based on the break detection method PRODIGE and SPLIDHOM for break
   correction. Both parts of the homogenization rely on the existence of
   highly correlated reference stations. After the statistical comparison
   with neighbouring stations, detected breaks are verified and further
   localized by metadata. Uncertainties of the break adjustments are
   estimated by altering reference stations and by applying a bootstrapping
   technique providing an objective indication about the reliability of the
   homogenization. The method was tested and applied to 71 time series of
   daily minimum (TN) and maximum temperatures (TX) in Austria covering the
   period 19482009. For some series homogenization was not possible due to
   large uncertainties in the adjustments or a lack of suitable reference
   series. In the remaining 57 TN and 54 TX series a total number of 139
   breaks were detected. Seventy-five percent of those breaks are
   documented in the metadata archive, with most of them being caused by
   station relocations and instrumentation changes. In general, the mean
   over the temperature dependent adjustments of all stations show a
   temperature reduction. However, the majority of breaks have mean
   amplitudes of less than 0.5 degrees C. A comprehensive analysis was
   performed on the new homogenized daily dataset, showing a widespread
   warming trend in both TN and TX series. The warming trend is in general
   amplified due to the homogenization. However, significant changes in the
   trend are only observed at very few stations. In autumn, however, the
   trend is reversed in many temperature based climate change detection
   indices'. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {With the introduction of High-k, metal gates and alternate substrates
   into the gate-stack at the 45nm and 32nm technology nodes, Bias
   Temperature Instability (BTI) phenomena have had to be included into the
   chip design modeling. In this paper, we explore BTI trends with High-k
   transistors in manufacturing ready CMOS processes with gate last and
   gate first type process flows. In both flows, Positive Bias Temperature
   Instability (PBTI) is a strong function of the interface and High-k
   thickness, with aggressive interface scaling having significant adverse
   reliability implications. Negative Bias Temperature Instability, on the
   other hand, is strongly dependent on the quality of the interface and
   its nitrogen content. The introduction of germanium into the Si channel
   is found to significantly improve NBTI. With recovery effects being
   strong in both NBTI and PBTI, AC BTI models in realistic circuit designs
   are critical to accurately evaluate the BTI lifetime of chips.},

Title = {Reconstructing the NH Mean Temperature: Can Underestimation of Trends

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {There are indications that hemispheric-mean climate reconstructions
   seriously underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency variability and
   trends. Some of the theory of linear regression and error-in-variables
   models is reviewed to identify the sources of this problem. On the basis
   of the insight gained, a reconstruction method that is supposed to
   minimize the underestimation is formulated. The method consists of
   reconstructing the local temperatures at the geographical locations of
   the proxies, followed by calculating the hemispheric average. The method
   is tested by applying it to an ensemble of surrogate temperature fields
   based on two climate simulations covering the last 500 and 1000 yr.
   Compared to the regularized expectation maximization (RegEM) truncated
   total least squares (TTLS) method and a composite-plus-scale method-two
   methods recently used in the literature-the new method strongly improves
   the behavior regarding low-frequency variability and trends. The
   potential importance in real-world situations is demonstrated by
   applying the methods to a set of 14 decadally smoothed proxies. Here the
   new method shows much larger low-frequency variability and a much colder
   preindustrial temperature level than the other reconstruction methods.
   However, this should mainly be seen as a demonstration of the potential
   losses and gains of variability, as the reconstructions based on the 14
   decadally smoothed proxies are not very robust.},

Abstract = {We compare homogenised series of maximum, minimum, and mean air
   temperature averaged over New Zealand (NZ) for the period 1871-2019,
   with surrounding ocean surface data. Temperatures over the New Zealand
   Exclusive Economic Zone exhibit an increase (linear trend) of 0.66
   degrees C from 1871-2019. As well as the anthropogenic warming signal
   (identified by CMIP5 simulations), interannual to decadal variability is
   also examined. Significant volcanic eruptions have caused temporary
   cooling and the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode is linked to
   warming over NZ. The influences of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
   (IPO) and the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are also evident in
   the temperature series. All warm years (>+0.45 degrees C above the
   1981-2010 normal) occur from 1998 onwards, and all of the nine cold
   years (<-0.84 degrees C below the 1981-2010 normal) occur prior to 1933.
   We conclude that the climate teleconnections that cause interannual to
   decadal variability (ENSO and IPO) are key factors in these results,
   beyond the anthropogenic warming signal.},

Volume = {121},

Abstract = {The presented study was concentrated on the trend analysis of the annual
   mean temperature series of 40 meteorological stations in all climatic
   zones of Turkey. The sensitivity of the parametric and nonparametric
   tests to the selected record periods was investigated in detail.
   Backward-shifted and forward-shifted trend analyses were accomplished by
   keeping either the beginning or the ending data period constant and
   varying the other period ending. This analysis resulted with a trend
   statistic direction turning point at the year 1992. Following this
   result, the trend tests were applied to three different records to
   distinguish the effect of 1992 on the trend direction. For the period
   1950-1992, the downward trend was dominating several stations whereas
   only upward trend was observed for 1986-2006 period. Clearly, the trend
   direction change in 1992 dominated the trend behavior between 1986 and
   2006. The opposite trend orientations on 1950-1992 and 1986-2006 periods
   seem to be neutralized on 1950-2006 period with the majority of the
   stations showing no trend as the result. This study displays the effect
   of different lengths of data record on the trend analysis results. It
   has been clear by this study that a sudden change on trend direction is
   obvious at the stations above 39 degrees N in Turkey provinces in 1992.
   These results are conformed to the previous studies related with climate
   change like temperature, sea level, meteorological observations, and
   dominant climatic events as North Atlantic Oscillation and El-Ni (n)
   over tildeo and Southern Oscillation.},

Abstract = {A workshop on enhancing climate change indices in South America was held
   in Maceio, Brazil, in August 2004. Scientists from eight southern
   countries brought daily climatological data from their region for a
   meticulous assessment of data quality and homogeneity, and for the
   preparation of climate change indices that can be used for analyses of
   changes in climate extremes. This study presents an examination of the
   trends over 1960 - 2000 in the indices of daily temperature extremes.
   The results indicate no consistent changes in the indices based on daily
   maximum temperature while significant trends were found in the indices
   based on daily minimum temperature. Significant increasing trends in the
   percentage of warm nights and decreasing trends in the percentage of
   cold nights were observed at many stations. It seems that this warming
   is mostly due to more warm nights and fewer cold nights during the
   summer (December February) and fall (March - May). The stations with
   significant trends appear to be located closer to the west and east
   coasts of South America.},

Abstract = {Data collected over a 14 year period (1977-1990) at three river stations
   have been used to study long term behaviour, trends and possible future
   changes of water temperature in the Exe Basin, Devon, UK. Long term mean
   temperatures are influenced by site elevation and catchment land use.
   Seasonal variation approximates a simple sine-generated curve and
   diurnal fluctuation is greater in spring than in autumn months.
   Significant rising trends were evident for the majority of water
   temperature parameters investigated and were related to air temperature
   changes and land use effects. Coupling of possible scenarios for future
   air temperature change with relationships between mean air and water
   temperatures and between extreme and mean water temperatures, suggests
   that significant increases in stream temperatures may occur by the
   middle of the next century, especially in small upland catchments during
   summer months.},

Title = {Trend Analysis of MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Land Cover in
   Central Italy},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important climate factor for
   understanding the relationship between the land surface and atmosphere.
   Furthermore, LST is linked to soil moisture and evapotranspiration,
   which can potentially alter the severity and regime of wildfires,
   landslide-triggering precipitation thresholds, and others. In this
   paper, the monthly daytime and nighttime LST products of Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are employed for the period
   2000-2023 in order to find areas that have been cooling or warming in a
   region of great interest in Central Italy, due to its complex geological
   and geomorphological settings and its recent seismic sequences and
   landslide events. The annual MODIS land cover images for 2001-2022 are
   also utilized to investigate the interconnection between LST and land
   cover change. The results of the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test
   and its associated Sen's slope reveal a significant nighttime warming
   trend in the region, particularly in July, linked to forest and woodland
   expansion. Grasslands toward the coastline with low elevation (less than
   500 m a.s.l.) have experienced significant heat waves during the summer,
   with an LST of more than 35 degrees C. A significant negative
   correlation between the elevation and LST is observed for each calendar
   month. In particular, the daytime and nighttime LST have more than 80\%
   correlation with elevation during winter and summer, respectively. In
   addition, nighttime warming and gradual drainage are noticed in Lake
   Campotosto. The results of this study could be useful for wildfire and
   landslide susceptibility analyses and hazard management.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {16},
Pages = {8591-8606},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {Quantifying the predictability of temperature in the future is a
   priority to inform policy and adaptation planning. Based on information
   entropy theory, this study uses global climate models within the Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to project spatiotemporal
   changes and variability of temperature in China in the 21st century
   under different shared socio-economic pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and
   SSP5-8.5). Results show that the multimodel ensembled values can
   accurately capture the spatiotemporal pattern of temperature in China.
   The warming rates of annual mean temperature in China under SSP2-4.5,
   SSP5-8.5 scenarios are 0.42 and 0.61 degrees C center dot decade(-1) in
   the near-term (2021-2050), 0.20 and 0.87 degrees C center dot decade(-1)
   in the long-term (2071-2100), respectively. Warming is found to be the
   greatest in winter. Northeast, northwest, and the first region of
   southwest are anticipated to increase particularly rapidly, with larger
   increases than the rest of China. The intrayear variability of
   temperature (the variability of monthly mean temperature within the year
   or different seasons) in China shows obvious latitudinal differences.
   The variability of monthly mean temperature exhibits a decreasing trend
   in parts of northeast and the first region of southwest, and an
   increasing trend in northwest and parts of north. This is mainly
   resultant from the variability of monthly mean temperatures within
   spring and autumn. And this trend is more significant under the SSP5-8.5
   scenario than that under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. The interannual
   variability of temperature (the variability of annual or seasonal mean
   temperature) in China shows significant regional difference, and two
   obvious regions with extreme variability (northeast and the first region
   of southwest). The trend of variability increases and then decreases
   under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, whereas it keeps increasing under the
   SSP5-8.5 scenario. This study helps to understand the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of temperature variability in China in the 21st century.},

Abstract = {28years of satellite data were used to calculate sea surface temperature
   (SST) climatologies covering Canada's 3 surrounding oceans and the Great
   Lakes. Results show the imprint of major circulation features on the
   spatial distribution of the SST. Together with the Gulf Stream, the
   Labrador Current generates a strong spatial variability of SST on the
   east coast. Most of the Canadian Arctic, with the exception of Hudson
   Bay and the coastal Beaufort Sea region, is characterized by very small
   seasonal SST amplitude. Lake Erie is the water body having the largest
   seasonal SST amplitude, but for the oceanic regions, it is the southern
   Gulf of St. Lawrence and the adjacent Scotian Shelf.A trend analysis
   showed that many regions are undergoing rapid warming of the sea
   surface. However, warming is not spatially uniform. The strongest
   warming was detected in Baffin Bay and appears to result from the
   decreasing ice cover. Lake Superior is also showing a strong warming
   trend.These results have important implications for fisheries management
   because SST affects many species. Regions with small yearly amplitudes
   and warming trends might act as future cool water oases for some
   species.},

Abstract = {Temperature trends in the lower atmosphere are reported to be increasing

   The analysis has been carried out for the satellite era 1979-2011 and
   for the whole period to bring out any plausible change in trends in
   temperature. It is observed that the annual trends indicate warming of
   the troposphere in both hemispheres whereas seasonal trends show mixed
   response obviously due to climatic forcing and land-ocean temperature
   contrasts. The variation in tropopause height is lesser over tropics of
   northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere. The mean tropopause
   temperature is more in the satellite era.},

Abstract = {Trend estimation of climatic characteristics for a watershed is required
   to determine developing compatible strategies related to design,
   development, and management of water resources. In this study, the
   trends of the annual maximum (T (max)), minimum (T (min)), and mean (T
   (mean)) air temperature; temperature anomaly (T (anomaly)); and diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) time series at 13 meteorological stations
   located in the Karun-Dez watershed were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall
   and linear regression trend tests. The pre-whitening method was used to
   eliminate the influence of serial correlation on the Mann-Kendall test.
   The result showed increasing trends in the T (min), T (mean), and T
   (anomaly) series at the majority of stations and decreasing trend in the
   T (max) and DTR series. A geographical analysis of the trends revealed a
   broad warming trend in most of the watershed, and the cooling trends
   were observed only in the southern parts. Furthermore, the geographical
   pattern of the trends in the T (mean) and T (anomaly) series was
   similar, and the T (max) data did not show any dominant trend for the
   whole watershed. This study provides temperature change scenarios that
   may be used for the design of future water resource projects in the

Abstract = {The timing and structure of sea surface temperature (SST) changes were
   investigated using data from the continental shelf of the northwest
   African region and from coastal stations in Mauritania. Empirical
   Orthogonal Function analysis of the data revealed differences between
   northern regions with permanent upwelling, and southern regions where
   the upwelling is seasonal. It is then hypothesized that shifts in the
   onset and duration of upwelling may be occurring. Furthermore, the
   Mauritanian shelf area, a transition zone between the northern and
   southern regions, appears to go through a series of cooling and warming
   trends, which seem to be part of a long-term process affecting the
   northwest African coast. In this regard. it is shown that there is a
   strong relationship between SST at 18-20 degrees N latitude and the
   Coastal Upwelling Index computed at a coastal station. This approach may
   allow for adequate predictions of oceanographic processes over the
   Mauritanian shelf, and probably the northwest African region, from
   coastal stations, as has been proven in other upwelling systems such as
   the California system. (C) Elsevier, Paris / Ifremer / Cnrs / Ird.},

Abstract = {Historical series of monthly mean temperatures from 27 Italian stations,
   updated to 1993, are analysed. Building on previous analysis the
   following new results were obtained: there is an upward trend in
   seasonal and annual temperatures during the last 20 years; a positive
   trend, stronger at southern stations compared to northern stations, is
   apparent from 1920 to 1950, after when temperature shows no significant
   trend until 1985 when it starts to increase again. Data from Northern
   Italy show similar characteristics to a subset of data from a global
   climatic database, for the period 1881-1988. This comparison, however,
   suggests that good station coverage is important for the construction of
   a more detailed picture of seasonal climate variability.},

   with a much smaller contribution from the mid-latitude land areas of the
   Northern Hemisphere. The implications of these results to the many
   explanations for the differential trend between the data sets are
   discussed.},

   variability patterns in North America},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {This study improves the understanding of circulation patterns associated
   with regional temperature trends by characterizing boreal summer
   temperature variability patterns in North America using rotated S-mode
   principal component analysis. We analyzed gridded observational 2-m
   temperature datasets and the ERA5 reanalysis temperature dataset to
   examine the climate patterns associated with long-term trends and
   inter-annual variability of temperature variability patterns in North
   America. Our analysis revealed significant trends among some classified
   temperature variability patterns from 1979 to 2022 summers, with
   inter-annual amplitudes (i.e., a departure from the mean state)
   signaling toward the warm regime. The anticyclonic circulation anomaly
   over the temperature coherent regions associated with
   Greenland/northeastern Canada, and Alaska, respectively, is linked to an
   increase in warm air advection and above-average temperatures, while
   cyclonic circulation over the northeast Pacific coast enhanced warm air
   advection and temperature increases in the coherent region comprising
   the northwestern portion of North America. The increase in global mean
   land and ocean temperatures is strongly associated with the long-term
   increase in the amplitude of atmospheric circulations associated with
   warm regimes in parts of North America. At the interannual time scale,
   temperature increase over Greenland/northeastern Canada is strongly
   associated with the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation. These
   findings highlight the modulating effects of global temperature increase
   and warming of the western tropical Pacific Ocean on the increasing
   amplitude of circulations associated with warm regimes in North America.
   Our results further indicate that the enhancement of anticyclonic
   circulations over the Arctic contributes to nearly 68\% of the observed
   reduction in sea ice extent.},

Abstract = {Sea surface temperature observations have shown that western boundary
   currents, such as the East Australian Current (EAC), are warming faster
   than the global average. However, we know little about coastal
   temperature trends inshore of these rapidly warming regions,
   particularly be-low the surface. In addition to this, warming rates are
   typi-cally estimated linearly, making it difficult to know how these
   rates have changed over time. Here we use long-term in situ temperature
   observations through the water column at five coastal sites between
   approximately 27.3-42.6 degrees S to estimate warming trends between the
   ocean surface and the bottom. Using an advanced trend detection method,
   we find acceler-ating warming trends at multiple depths in the EAC
   exten-sion region at 34.1 and 42.6 degrees S. We see accelerating trends
   at the surface and bottom at 34.1 degrees S but similar trends in the
   top 20 m at 42.6 degrees S. We compare several methods, es-timate
   uncertainty, and place our results in the context of previously reported
   trends, highlighting that magnitudes are depth-dependent, vary across
   latitude, and are sensitive to the data time period chosen. The spatial
   and temporal vari-ability in the long-term temperature trends highlight
   the im-portant role of regional dynamics against a background of
   broad-scale ocean warming. Moreover, considering that re -cent studies
   of ocean warming typically focus on surface data only, our results show
   the necessity of subsurface data for the improved understanding of
   regional climate change impacts.},

Abstract = {In the recent past, scientific modeling of climatic elements, in
   particular, temperature data has attained considerable importance as it
   affects many aspects of the environment and also indicates a clear sign
   of climate change. The temperature warming is mainly associated with the
   increasing concentration of greenhouse gases triggered by the land use
   and land cover changes. In the last century, exploitation of forest
   resource, population influx, and expansion of agricultural land has
   changed the natural landscape of North Bengal to a great extent. Thus
   the present study intends to find out long-term changes in maximum and
   minimum temperature for six northern districts of the state of West
   Bengal, popularly known as North Bengal. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test and Theil-Sen's slope estimator reveals the presence of warming
   trends in both maximum and minimum temperature. Annual temperature is
   rising 0.006 degrees C per year and 0.007 degrees C per year at most of
   the districts for the maximum and minimum temperature respectively.
   However, the seasonal analysis of trend exposes that post-monsoon and
   winter temperature rise are predominantly contributing to the upward
   annual trend. The highest increasing trend in maximum and minimum
   temperature is observed at Malda (0.013 degrees C per year) in the
   post-monsoon and winter season respectively. Except the post-monsoon
   season, the minimum temperature is rising rapidly than maximum
   temperature across the region. Additionally, Sequential Mann-Kendall
   test exhibits the periodic fluctuation of trends, which aremore
   prominent in pre-monsoon and monsoon season.},

Abstract = {Trends and uncertainties of surface air temperature over the Tibetan

   stations during the period 1951-2013. The sampling error variances of
   gridded monthly data are estimated for every month and every grid box of

   calculate TP averages, their trends, and associated uncertainties. It is
   shown that large sampling error variances dominate northern and western
   TP, while small variances appear over southern and eastern TP. Every
   month from January to December has a positive linear trend during the
   study period. February has the largest trend of 0.34 +/- 0.18A degrees C
   (10 yr)(-1), and April the smallest at 0.15 +/- 0.11A degrees C (10

Abstract = {Recent climate trends evidence a rise of temperatures and an increase in
   the duration and intensity of droughts which is in turn leading to the
   occurrence of larger wildfires, which threaten the environment as well
   as human lives and beings. In this context, improved wildfires
   prediction tools are urgently needed. In this paper, the use of remotely
   sensed soil moisture data as a key variable in the climate-wildfires
   relationship is explored. The study is centered in the fires registered
   in the Iberian Peninsula during the period 2010-2014. Their
   prior-to-occurrence surface moisture-temperature conditions were
   analyzed using SMOS-derived soil moisture data and ERA-Interim land
   surface temperature reanalysis. Results showed that moisture and
   temperature conditions limited the extent of wildfires, and a potential
   maximum burned area per moisture-temperature paired values was obtained
   (R-2=0.43). The model relating fire extent with moisture-temperature
   preconditions was improved by including information on land cover,
   regions, and the month of the fire outbreak (R-2=0.68). Model
   predictions had an accuracy of 83.3\% with a maximum error of 40.5 ha.
   Results were majorly coherent with wildfires behavior in the Iberian
   Peninsula and reflected the duality between Euro-Siberian and
   Mediterranean regions in terms of expected burned area. The proposed
   model has a promising potential for the enhancement of fire prevention
   services.},

Title = {Coastal Greenland air temperature extremes and trends 1890-2010: annual

Abstract = {We use observed air temperature data series from 14 meteorological
   stations in coastal Greenland (located all around the Greenland Ice
   Sheet) for 1960-2010, where long-term records for five of the stations
   extend back to 1890, to illustrate the annual and monthly temporal and
   spatial distribution of temperature extremes, with the main focus on the
   latest decade 2001-2010 (2000s). We find that the 2000s had the highest
   number of mean annual air temperature (MAAT) warm extremes, and the
   1890s the highest number of cold extremes, and that a high (low)
   positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index equals a high number of
   cold (warm) extreme events. For the 2000s the number of warm extremes
   was significantly higher by around 50\% than the number in the 1940s
   (the early twentieth century warm period): the latter being the decade
   with the second highest occurrence of MAAT warm extremes. Since 1960,
   based on MAAT the number of cold extremes has overall decreased on the
   decadal timescale, besides a peak in 1980s, while warm extremes have
   increased, leading to a higher occurrence of extremes (cold plus warm
   extremes): an almost similar pattern occurred for monthly mean
   temperatures and monthly mean daily maximum and minimum temperature
   datasets. Furthermore, a division of Greenland into east and west
   sectors shows that the occurrence of cold (warm) extremes was more
   pronounced in the East than in the West in the 1960s and 1970s
   (mid-1980s to the 2000s).},

Abstract = {The daily minimum, maximum and mean temperature data at 37 weather
   stations in Iran from 1960 to 2018 were analyzed for their homogeneity
   and trend. Of these, only 10 stations passed the homogeneity test
   successfully without any break point or outlier. Approximately 75\% of
   the breaks could be explained by the station relocation. Annual and
   seasonal anomalies of the homogenized series were calculated using the
   30-year period of 1961-1990 as the reference. The regional trend of
   temperature was estimated using the mean annual and seasonal anomalies
   from stations that showed similar variability. The mean temperatures
   showed a positive trend over most of the 10 regions in Iran, with the
   rate of change varying from 0.1 to 0.4 degrees C/decade. The minimum
   temperatures increased significantly in all the regions at the rate of
   0.35- 0.63 degrees C/decade, with the highest warming occurring over the
   central area of Iran in autumn. The maximum temperatures showed a
   positive trend over all the 10 regions with the exception of the east
   area. The associated rate of change varied from 0.14 to 0.29 degrees
   C/decade. The highest increase occurred over the Northeastern area

Abstract = {The new PAGES2k global compilation of temperature-sensitive proxies
   offers an unprecedented opportunity to study regional to global trends
   associated with orbitally driven changes in solar irradiance over the
   past 2 millennia. Here, we analyze pre-industrial long-term trends from
   1 to 1800 CE across the PAGES2k dataset and find that, in contrast to
   the gradual cooling apparent in ice core, marine, and lake sediment
   data, tree rings do not exhibit the same decline. To understand why
   tree-ring proxies lack any evidence of a significant pre-industrial
   cooling, we divide those data by location (high Northern Hemisphere
   latitudes vs. midlatitudes), seasonal response (annual vs. summer),
   de-trending method, and temperature sensitivity (high vs. low). We
   conclude that the ability of tree-ring proxies to detect pre-industrial,
   millennial-long cooling is not affected by latitude, seasonal
   sensitivity, or detrending method. Caution is advised when using
   multi-proxy approaches to reconstruct long-term temperature changes over
   the entire Common Era.},

Title = {Air temperature trends and extremes in Chisinau (Moldova) as evidence of
   climate change},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {247-256},
Abstract = {A trend analysis of surface temperature in Chisinau (Moldova) between
   1887 and 2008 is presented. The observational data included monthly mean
   temperatures (Tmean) for the whole period, and monthly mean maximum
   (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures since 1945. The following
   principal aspects were studied: (1) long-term temperature trends and
   changes in their patterns; (2) seasonal temperature extremes and their
   links with rising mean temperatures; and (3) an extremely hot summer of
   2007 in Moldova as evidence of regional warming. In the last 3 decades,
   strong positive trends were observed in all temperature variables and,
   unlike previous periods (1945-1980), have become statistically
   significant for most seasons. Trends increased drastically: annual,
   winter and summer Tmean rose by about 0.62, 0.50 and 0.95 degrees C per
   decade, respectively, in 1981-2008, compared with 0.035, 0.075 and 0.018
   degrees C per decade, respectively, in 1887-1980. Means of seasonal
   (except autumn) and annual temperatures in 1981-2008 differed from
   previous years at a 95\% and higher confidence level; their variability,
   expressed in standard deviation (SD) values (sigma), did not change
   significantly. In the last 3 decades there was practically no
   significant change in means, variability and distribution of Tmax in
   comparison with 1945-1980; however, Tmin changed significantly in all
   these statistics. The lack of significant changes in recent Tmax
   resulted in a relative stability of the frequency of temperature
   extremes, defined as the 90th and 95th percentiles of long-term
   distributions in winter and summer; some increase is observed only for
   absolute maxima. In 1981-2008 these thresholds for mean Tmin were
   exceeded 7 and 3 times, respectively, compared to the 1940s-1970s, when
   there were no such extreme events. The results strongly suggest that the
   observed warming in Chisinau was primarily caused by the Tmin increase.
   In summer 2007, monthly Tmean exceeded the corresponding values of the
   baseline (1961-1990) climate by 2.5-4.0 sigma, the seasonal Tmean by 5
   sigma.},

Abstract = {A database of daily extreme temperature was created for as many stations
   as possible for Uruguay, as far back as possible. This is the first
   attempt to gather all the different data sources together, perform a
   quality control and homogeneity assessment. We work with seven stations;
   it should be taken into account that Uruguay is a small country (around
   177 000 km(2)) and this represents most of the available data. There are
   three old series with starting dates in 1930, and four that start around
   1950. From this database, a set of four extreme temperature indices was
   constructed for the oldest five stations, warm days (TX90), cold days
   (TX10), warm nights (TN90) and cold nights (TN10).
   The index TN10 shows the largest significant negative trend for the
   period 1960-2002, while TN90 shows a positive but not significant trend
   for this period indicating a strong warming of nighttime temperature. A
   spectral analysis was performed using the multi taper methods (MTM) to
   the de-trended annual, summer Dec-Feb (DJF) and winter Jun-Aug (JJA)
   indices time-series. This analysis shows that on inter-annual
   timescales, the most significant range of frequencies is from 2 to 2.5
   years and from 3 to 6 years. Low frequencies of variability were
   detected when the MTM was applied to de-trended smoothed annual
   time-series, around the range of frequencies of 15-25 years for almost
   all the indices analysed. Links with global sea surface temperature
   (SST) were studied for two stations (Paysandu and Rocha), and it was
   found that the indices showed largest correlations with SST anomalies in
   the Pacific Ocean. We detected changes in the response of the TN10 index
   for Rocha station when the series was split up into two different
   periods (1942-1976 and 1977-2005). Copyright (C) 2007 Royal

Abstract = {A high elevation data set of surface temperatures from the Front Range
   of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, USA, is analysed for evidence of
   long-term change (1952-98). Sites range from the high plains of Colorado
   (1509 m) to the alpine tundra (3749 m). Systematic changes in
   surface-based lapse rates are uncovered, with absolute cooling at the
   hi-hest elevations, but little temperature change on the high plains.
   There is lapse-rate steepening at the higher elevations (>3000 m). A
   synoptic analysis using gridded pressure data shows lapse rate changes
   to be largely independent of synoptic type. Radiosonde ascents from
   Denver (1956-98) and Grand Junction (1946-98) are used to derive air
   equivalent temperatures (AETs) at the same elevations as the surface
   records. AETs show a contrasting temporal trend, with absolute warming
   at all levels. Furthermore, free-air lapse rates are weakening at higher
   elevations, the warming becoming stronger with height. A comparison of
   the two data sets through derivation of free-air-surface temperature
   differences shows that the alpine tundra zone of the high Rockies is
   becoming a progressively stronger heat sink. Possible explanations
   include increased snow cover, enhanced air movement over the surface and
   decreased solar radiation input. The heat sink enhancement has led to
   rapid cooling in the alpine tundra that could not be predicted from the
   free-air record, casting doubt upon the strong dependence on free-air
   temperature changes in climate modelling when investigating the
   potential effects of global warming in mountainous regions. In addition,
   these local surface trends are of the opposite sign to global and other
   regional trends identified in many recent observational and modelling
   studies. Copyright (C) 2002 Royal Meteorological Society.},

   GLOBAL TEMPERATURE TRENDS},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {235-240},
Abstract = {A work intensity function is defined as the product of the frequencies
   exhibited by a column in a histogram and the magnitude of the midpoint
   of the class interval of the column. An intensity distribution is
   defined as the cumulative sum of the function along the abscissa. These
   functions are examined first for a normal distribution, and then for the
   expected deviations shown by a sample assumed to be drawn from a normal
   distribution. The theoretical maximum of the intensity is found at one
   standard deviation for the normal distribution and at square-root 2 s.d.
   (standard deviation) for a sample drawn from a normal distribution. The
   cumulative sum of the intensity is more biased towards outlying values
   of larger magnitude for the sample than for the normal distribution.
   10\% of the cumulative sum of the intensities is generated at s.d.
   greater than 3 for the sample compared to only 1\% for the normal
   distribution itself. These statistics are compared with similar ones
   computed for the Jones-Parker (1991) series of mean global surface
   temperature anomaly interannual differences. The agreement between
   theory and the data series is good. The data series appears to possess
   those properties which would be expected of it if the series was a
   sample drawn from a normal distribution. It is concluded that the work
   intensity and its cumulative sum are useful tools in diagnosing the
   behaviour of a population of anomaly values. These statistics do not
   clarify the problem of identifying a greenhouse gas induced global
   warming but they do suggest that its identification continues to be as
   difficult as ever, due to the effect of occasional outlying values.},

Abstract = {West African summer rainfall, north China summer rainfall and a new
   climate proxy, snow accumulation from the Dasuopu ice core in the
   southern Himalaya, have all experienced decreasing trends during the
   latter half of the 20th century. In this paper, we investigate the
   existence of a common mechanism that explains these geographically
   dispersed trends during the boreal summer. In particular, we explore the
   hypothesis that these trends are related to changes in the regional
   Hadley and Walker circulations. We show that the divergent circulation
   in the NCEP reanalysis indicates the existence of trends in these
   circulations that are consistent with the observed changes in the
   precipitation records. In addition, the regressions of the divergent
   circulation in the NCEP reanalysis against these precipitation records
   indicate that a similar globally coherent signal is associated with the
   time series and their linear trends while the regressions against the
   de-trended residuals do not contain statistically significant
   large-scale signals. These similarities lead us to conclude that the
   decreasing trends in the three precipitation time series during the
   latter half of the 20th century are consistent with large-scale changes
   in the global overturning circulation during the boreal summer.

Title = {How much has the Sun influenced Northern Hemisphere temperature trends?
   An ongoing debate},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In order to evaluate how much Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) has
   influenced Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends, it is
   important to have reliable estimates of both quantities. Sixteen
   different estimates of the changes in TSI since at least the 19(th)
   century were compiled from the literature. Half of these estimates are
   ``low variability{''} and half are ``high variability{''}. Meanwhile,
   five largely-independent methods for estimating Northern Hemisphere
   temperature trends were evaluated using: 1) only rural weather stations;
   2) all available stations whether urban or rural (the standard
   approach); 3) only sea surface temperatures; 4) tree-ring widths as
   temperature proxies; 5) glacier length records as temperature proxies.
   The standard estimates which use urban as well as rural stations were
   somewhat anomalous as they implied a much greater warming in recent
   decades than the other estimates, suggesting that urbanization bias
   might still be a problem in current global temperature datasets -
   despite the conclusions of some earlier studies. Nonetheless, all five
   estimates confirm that it is currently warmer than the late 19(th)
   century, i.e., there has been some ``global warming{''} since the 19(th)
   century. For each of the five estimates of Northern Hemisphere
   temperatures, the contribution from direct solar forcing for all sixteen
   estimates of TSI was evaluated using simple linear least-squares
   fitting. The role of human activity on recent warming was then
   calculated by fitting the residuals to the UN IPCC's recommended
   ``anthropogenic forcings{''} time series. For all five Northern
   Hemisphere temperature series, different TSI estimates suggest
   everything from no role for the Sun in recent decades (implying that
   recent global warming is mostly human-caused) to most of the recent
   global warming being due to changes in solar activity (that is, that
   recent global warming is mostly natural). It appears that previous
   studies (including the most recent IPCC reports) which had prematurely
   concluded the former, had done so because they failed to adequately
   consider all the relevant estimates of TSI and/or to satisfactorily
   address the uncertainties still associated with Northern Hemisphere
   temperature trend estimates. Therefore, several recommendations on how
   the scientific community can more satisfactorily resolve these issues
   are provided.},

   advanced developments; (2) warm stamping approaches in which complete
   austenitisation is not attained during heating; (3) hot stamping with a
   lower forming temperature, i.e., low-temperature hot stamping (LTHS);
   (4) advanced medium-Mn steels with lower austenitisation temperatures

Abstract = {Two and a half decade (1985-2009) surface air temperature from Giovanni
   database available for the Naradu valley at High Himalaya Mountain range
   of Himachal Pradesh has been analysed to determine the changes in the
   maximum, minimum and mean air temperatures. The analysis was subjected
   for seasonal, annual and monthly basis and revealed a tendency towards
   warmer years all around, with significantly warmer winter and more
   significant increase in minimum temperatures. The annual maximum,
   minimum and mean temperatures have increase by 1,41 degrees C, 1,63
   degrees C and 1,49 degrees C, respectively. The seasonal analysis
   indicates that the tendency is more pronounced in winter followed by
   post-monsoon, pre-monsoon and monsoon season. The trends were also
   examined on a maximum temperatures, and it showed a significant warning
   in all the months in annual mean, minimum and maximum temperatures,
   except February during the period of 1985-2009 in the valley. Different
   trend detection statistical tools have been exercised by using variety
   of non-parametric tests and all are in agreement. (C) 2014 Published by

Title = {The hindcast skill of the CMIP ensembles for the surface air temperature
   trend},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Linear trends of the surface air temperature (SAT) simulated by selected
   models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5)
   historical experiments are evaluated using observations to document (1)
   the expected range and characteristics of the errors in hindcasting the
   `change' in SAT at different spatiotemporal scales, (2) if there are
   `threshold' spatiotemporal scales across which the models show
   substantially improved performance, and (3) how they differ between
   CMIP3 and CMIP5. Root Mean Square Error, linear correlation, and Brier
   score show better agreement with the observations as spatiotemporal
   scale increases but the skill for the regional (5 degrees x 5 degrees -
   20 degrees x 20 degrees grid) and decadal (10 - similar to 30-year
   trends) scales is rather limited. Rapid improvements are seen across 30
   degrees x 30 degrees grid to zonal average and around 30 years, although
   they depend on the performance statistics. Rather abrupt change in the
   performance from 30 degrees x 30 degrees grid to zonal average implies
   that averaging out longitudinal features, such as land-ocean contrast,
   might significantly improve the reliability of the simulated SAT trend.
   The mean bias and ensemble spread relative to the observed variability,
   which are crucial to the reliability of the ensemble distribution, are
   not necessarily improved with increasing scales and may impact
   probabilistic predictions more at longer temporal scales. No significant
   differences are found in the performance of CMIP3 and CMIP5 at the large
   spatiotemporal scales, but at smaller scales the CMIP5 ensemble often
   shows better correlation and Brier score, indicating improvements in the
   CMIP5 on the temporal dynamics of SAT at regional and decadal scales.},

   temperature trends},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {29},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {{[}1] The effects of changes in ozone and well-mixed greenhouse gases
   upon the annual-mean stratospheric temperatures are investigated using a
   general circulation model and compared with the observed (1979-2000)
   trends. In the global-mean lower stratosphere (50-100 hPa), ozone
   changes exert the most important influence upon the cooling trend. In
   the upper stratosphere, where both ozone and greenhouse gas changes
   influence the temperature trends, the amount of cooling is sensitive to
   the background ozone climatology. Taking into account the uncertainties
   in the observed temperature trend estimates and the dynamical
   variability of the model, the simulated results are in reasonable
   quantitative agreement with the vertical profile of the observed
   global-and-annual-mean stratospheric cooling, and with the observed
   lower stratospheric zonal-and-annual-mean cooling. This affirms the
   major role of these species in the temperature trend of the stratosphere
   over the past two decades.},

Title = {Seasonal Variability of Trends in Regional Hot and Warm Temperature
   Extremes in Europe},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Extremely hot or warm weather over the course of the year may have
   significant impacts on many aspects of human life, the economy, and the
   natural environment. Until now a thorough assessment of changes of
   extreme heat or warm events in Europe was hindered by the number of
   metrics employed, time periods examined, and most studies being
   conducted in the summer season only. Here, we employ the Extremity Index
   (EI) to investigate long-term trends in extremely hot or warm days in
   Europe over the course of the year, with a special focus on their
   frequency, spatial extent, and intensity. An extreme temperature event
   (ETE) is defined as a day with an unusually high temperature for a given
   location and season, even if such a temperature would not be considered
   extremely high in an absolute sense. The research is conducted in five
   spatial domains that together cover a large portion of Europe. The
   period of the most recent 70 years is considered. In all examined
   regions, mainly significant increasing trends since 1950 are evident for
   seasonal EI; therefore, also for ETE frequency, intensity, and spatial
   range. Yet, every region is characterized by its own event pattern, and
   trends across the continent strongly vary geographically and seasonally.
   Our study highlights that examined trends of temperature extremes are
   accelerating and in the last 40 years the rate of change has been even
   more than three times greater than in the entire study period. The
   greatest changes were noted for the summer season in Central Europe and
   Eastern Europe for the most recent 40-year period.},

Abstract = {Global surface skin temperature has been retrieved from MetOp IASI
   ultraspectral infrared measurements over the past 13+ years. Monthly and
   spatially gridded surface skin temperature is produced to show some
   phenomena associated with its natural variability. This article has
   aimed to demonstrate that thermal infrared remote sensing data can be
   used for monitoring global surface environmental characteristics and
   associated change through the continuity observations of MetOp series.
   The time-series anomalies of surface skin temperature are used to
   estimate its associated trend. Error estimation and evaluation has been
   performed and discussed in order to understand the uncertainty and
   variability in the trends. The trends derived from IASI global surface
   skin temperatures are compared with those of the NASA GISS global
   surface air temperature. Despite the physical differences between
   surface skin and air temperatures, reasonable agreement is shown between
   these two datasets indicating consistency and global surface warming,
   achieving our core objective of investigating the surface skin
   temperature retrieved from MetOp satellites' measurements and associated
   trends. The inferred trend of IASI global surface skin temperature
   illustrates an approximate 0.037 +/- 0.002 K/yr. global average increase
   has occurred during the September 2007-present (November 2020) time
   period; this warming trend is more pronounced in the northern

Abstract = {The European project MULTILAYER is focused on the mass-production of
   micro devices by using several different layers which are individually
   structured and treated and then ultimately assembled. Among the main
   goals of this project, is the development of 3D structuring of thin
   tapes which contain nanosized or very fine grained powders as well as
   tapes with UV-curable binder systems by means of almost room temperature
   embossing. Such a new process should allow achieving high resolution (<
   100 microns), tight tolerances and high reproducibility of structuring.
   Starting with planar tools for embossing testing parts, the technique
   will be further improved for using structured rolls for demonstrating a
   high throughput process.
   Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe the recent solutions
   developed at CEA for performing room temperature embossing. For this
   purpose alumina and zirconia tapes, developed within the consortium,
   were used. A first room temperature embossing system will be here
   presented. Preliminary experiments with systematic basic tests have been
   carried out in order to determine a functional concept of room
   temperature embossing process. The main conditions have included the
   tool motion and structure, the embossing temperature, the surface
   treatment of prototypes tools, the applied pressure, and the intrinsic
   parameters of the used green tapes. A peculiar attention has been paid
   on the processing time that has to be shortening as possible.},

Abstract = {Sea surface temperature variability in the North Atlantic Ocean recorded
   since about 1850 has been ascribed to a natural multi-decadal
   oscillation superimposed on a background warming trend(1-6). It has been
   suggested that the multidecadal variability may be a persistent
   feature(6-8), raising the possibility that the associated climate
   impacts may be predictable(9). However, our understanding of the
   multidecadal ocean variability before the instrumental record is based
   on interpretations of high-latitude terrestrial proxy records(7,8). Here
   we present an absolutely dated and annually resolved record of sea
   surface temperature from the Bahamas, based on a 440-year time series of
   coral growth rates. The reconstruction indicates that temperatures were
   as warm as today from about 1552 to 1570, then cooled by about 1 degrees
   C from 1650 to 1730 before warming until the present. Our estimates of
   background variability suggest that much of the warming since 1900 was
   driven by anthropogenic forcing. Interdecadal variability with a period
   of 15-25 years is superimposed on most of the record, but multidecadal
   variability becomes significant only after 1730. We conclude that the
   multidecadal variability in sea surface temperatures in the low-latitude
   western Atlantic Ocean may not be persistent, potentially making
   accurate decadal climate forecasts more difficult to achieve.},

Abstract = {This work analyses temperature characteristics in order to identify
   temperature trends in Novi Sad area for the period between the years
   1951-1990. The data used were obtained in meteorological stations in
   Rimski Sancevi and in Petrovaradin. This study presents annual mean
   temperatures, average values at 7, 14 and 21h, average mean maximum and
   minimum values and average values per different seasons, respectively.
   Different statistical methods ( arithmetic mean, standard deviation and
   correlation coefficient) and formulae of vertical gradient of air
   temperature and thermal coefficient were applied when analyzing
   temperature values. On the basis of analyzed and given results, it can
   be concluded that Novi Sad area experiences the trend of air temperature
   rise. A significant temperature rise is recorded during winter and
   spring period, while similar trend of rise is noticed when minimum
   average temperatures are observed. On the other hand, average maximum
   values show a rather slower trend of rise or even the fall in
   temperature, while a significant trend of air temperature fall is
   recorded during summer and spring periods.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic influences have led to a strengthening and poleward shift
   of westerly winds over the Southern Ocean, especially during austral
   summer. We use observations, an idealized eddy-resolving ocean sea ice
   channel model, and a global coupled model to explore the Southern Ocean
   response to a step change in westerly winds. Previous work hypothesized
   a two time scale response for sea surface temperature. Initially, Ekman
   transport cools the surface before sustained upwelling causes warming on
   decadal time scales. The fast response is robust across our models and
   the observations: We find Ekman-driven cooling in the mixed layer,
   mixing-driven warming below the mixed layer, and a small
   upwelling-driven warming at the temperature inversion. The long-term
   response is inaccessible from observations. Neither of our models shows
   a persistent upwelling anomaly, or long-term, upwelling-driven
   subsurface warming. Mesoscale eddies act to oppose the anomalous
   wind-driven upwelling, through a process known as eddy compensation,
   thereby preventing long-term warming.},

   which the textbooks I study are published, and I analyse textbooks
   content revealing different approaches to present the notion of
   temperature. I argue that these results show that textbooks are valuable
   sources to investigate public representations of science and their shift
   over time, and I conclude by stressing the parallel of this evolution

Abstract = {The spatial distribution of recent mean temperature trends over Spain
   during the period 1961-2006 at monthly, seasonal and annual time scale
   is carried out in this study by applying various statistical tools to
   data from 473 weather stations. The magnitude of trends was derived from
   the slopes of the linear trends using ordinary least-square fitting. The
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to determine the statistical
   significance of trends. Maps of surface temperature trends were
   generated by applying a geostatistical interpolation technique to
   visualize the detected tendencies. This study reveals that temperature
   has generally increased during all months and seasons of the year over
   the last four decades. More than 60\% of whole Spain has evidenced
   significant positive trends in March, June, August, spring and summer.
   This percentage diminishes around 40\% in April. May and December.
   Annual temperature has significantly risen in 100\% of Spain of around
   0.1-0.2 degrees C/decade according to the Fourth Assessment Report of

Abstract = {The surface warming of northern continents during the twentieth century
   is not uniform across seasons. Surface warming is particularly
   pronounced over northwestern Canada, where winter trends are much larger
   than summer ones. The upper-air temperature trends over the region are
   analyzed in three radiosonde datasets from 1958 to 2012 to assess their
   seasonal structure. The seasonal variation of upper-air trends can
   provide insights into the dynamical and thermodynamical processes
   generating these trends, including warming at the surface. The focus is
   not on the canonical structure of secular (i.e., long-term)
   trends-tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling-but its seasonal
   variation. We find the boreal winter-minus-summer difference in trends
   over northwestern Canada to be positive and large in the lower
   troposphere (p greater than or similar to 500 hPa) and lower
   stratosphere (50 hPa less than or similar to p less than or similar to
   150 hPa); it is largest at the surface and smallest at the tropopause.
   The decreasing seasonality of the tropospheric trend with height
   supports the attribution of the notable seasonality of surface warming
   in this region to both land-surface-hydroclimate interactions and
   changes in winter circulation. In the lower stratosphere, a cooling
   trend is evident in all seasons, not unexpectedly, but a pronounced
   seasonality is again apparent, with the strongest cooling in summer. The
   near-zero trend tropopause region is a rare point of confluence for
   seasonal trends.},

Abstract = {The study presents the results of trend analysis of temperature during
   over the Brahmaputra valley of Assam based on observed daily temperature
   data during 1986-2015. Theil Sen's slope method was used to detect the
   trends of temperature (mean, maximum and minimum) on monthly, seasonal
   and annual basis. Trend analysis revealed that mean, maximum and minimum
   temperature showed increasing tendencies during all the months over the
   Brahmaputra valley during 1986-2015. Mann-Kendall test revealed that the
   trends of mean, maximum and minimum temperature were statistically
   significant during 9, 4 and 3 months, respectively. The magnitude of
   trend of mean temperature was the highest in the month of March (0.56
   degrees C/decade) followed by September (0.44 degrees C/decade) and
   October (0.42 degrees C/decade). Trends of temperature during different
   seasons over the valley were significantly positive, except minimum
   temperature during post-monsoon season. As a result, the Brahmaputra
   valley has warmed by 0.90 degrees C between 1986 and 2015. Overall
   increase of annual maximum temperature (1.23 degrees C) was double that
   of minimum temperature (0.60 degrees C) during the study period.
   Considering the normal temperature and cardinal temperature requirement
   during different growth phases of rice, the observed trend of
   temperature is not going to impact kharif rice crop negatively in near
   future in the Brahmaputra valley. The impacts on boro rice crop are
   likely to be positive in near future.},

Title = {Varied degrees of urbanization effects on observed surface air
   temperature trends in China},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},
Pages = {131-143},
Abstract = {Debates over the bias in regional climate records caused by urbanization
   effects continue, and the diverse estimates of this bias can be partly
   attributed to different study methods and materials. In this study, we
   proposed an index (the extent of urban impact, EUI) by quantifying
   urbanization effects in terms of urban area and station location
   relative to urbanized areas. The EUI was used to represent the extent of
   urban impact on the meteorological stations used for observing
   temperature. Based on the EUI quantification, 569 stations in China were
   classified into 3 categories: stations with little or no urban impact (R
   stations), stations with low urban impact (LU stations), and stations
   with high urban impact (HU stations). Results show that, on average,
   EUIs for R, LU, and HU stations were 0.3, 2.6, and 15.3\%, respectively,
   implying diverse urbanization influences on the studied stations. Using
   R stations as a baseline, the average urbanization effects on the
   warming trend of surface air temperature (SAT) for China during
   1961-2012 for the LU and HU stations were estimated to be 0.06 and 0.09
   degrees C decade(-1), respectively. Therefore, including LU and HU
   stations to estimate regional SAT trends would lead to notable biases.
   The bias of the urbanization effect in the average SAT trend of China
   based on all stations was estimated to be 0.05 degrees C decade(-1),
   accounting for 18\% of the overall warming over the period 1961-2012.
   This estimation should be considered the lowest range of the bias. This
   study highlights the necessity of considering urbanization effect biases
   when assessing regional climate change.},

Title = {Twentieth-Century Trends in the Annual Cycle of Temperature across the
   Northern Hemisphere},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {15},
Pages = {5755-5773},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The annual cycle of surface air temperature is examined across Northern
   Hemisphere land areas (north of 25 degrees N) by comparing the results
   from the Climatic Research Unit Time Series (CRU TS) dataset against
   four reanalysis datasets: two versions of the NOAA Twentieth Century
   Reanalysis (20CR and 20CRC) and two versions of the ECMWF Twentieth
   Century Reanalysis, version 2 (ERA-20C) and version 2c (ERA-20CM). The
   modulated annual cycle is adaptively derived from an ensemble empirical
   mode decomposition (EEMD) filter, and is used to define the phase and
   amplitude of the annual cycle. The EEMD method does not impose a simple
   sinusoidal shape of the annual cycle. None of the reanalysis simulations
   assimilates surface temperature or land-use data. However, they differ
   in the parameters that are included: both ERA-20C and 20CR assimilate
   surface pressure data; ERA-20C also includes surface wind data over the
   oceans; and ERA-20CM does not assimilate any of these synoptic data. It
   is demonstrated that synoptic variability is critical for explaining the
   trends and variability of the annual cycle of surface temperature across
   the Northern Hemisphere. The CMIP5 forcings alone are insufficient to
   explain the observed trends and decadal-scale variability, particularly
   with respect to the decline in the amplitude of the annual cycle
   throughout the twentieth century. The variability in the annual cycle
   during the latter half of the twentieth century was unusual in the
   context of the twentieth century, and was most likely related to
   large-scale atmospheric variability, although uncertainty in the results
   is greatest before about 1930.},

   technology suits the front-end design. Among them, the way a technology
   lends itself to the realization of additional functions, for instance,
   the charge reset in a charge-sensitive loop or the time-variant filters

Title = {Regional differences in shifts of temperature trends across China
   between 1980 and 2017},

Abstract = {As the climate system is known to be warming unevenly, the open question
   of whether there has been a significant warming hiatus at global or
   regional scales has attracted worldwide attention. With annual mean air
   temperature (T-mean) setting new records subsequent to 2012, it is
   reasonable to reanalyse the presence of an apparent decelerated warming
   trend in China. We therefore examined the shifts of temperature trends
   in China between 1980 and 2017 using homogenized records from 798
   meteorological stations via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend
   (BFAST) method and Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator statistical
   tests. The results show that T-mean at the country level exhibited
   monotonic increase with a positive break occurring around 1997, and the
   warming rate during 1980-2017 (0.36 degrees C/decade) was slightly
   higher than that during 1980-1997, which suggests that this positive
   break did not overwhelm the overall continuous warming trend. Spatial
   records show that most areas west of 108 degrees E or south of 30
   degrees N within the country experienced a continual warming trend over
   the study period and that negative break that occurred around 2010 was
   major contributor to temporary decelerated warming trend detected in
   other areas, especially in Northeast China. Hence, this study highlights
   annual air temperature has continued to rise overall in China since
   1980, while considerable regional differences have been detected within
   the shifts of temperature trends.},

Title = {Observed trend of diurnal temperature range in the Tibetan Plateau in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},

Volume = {36},

Pages = {2633-2643},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Spatial and temporal variabilities of long-term (1961-2013) diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) are examined in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) based
   on the 71 observational stations. The relative regional contributions to
   DTR in the TP are studied among maximum temperature, minimum
   temperature, total cloud cover (TCC), and atmospheric teleconnections.
   The regional annual mean DTR (average of the 71 stations) is 14.17
   degrees C, with a clear maximum in winter (16.35 degrees C) and minimum
   in summer (12.62 degrees C). During 1961-2013, the DTR in the TP
   declines before the 1980s and shows mute change afterwards, with an
   annual rate of -0.20 degrees C decade(-1) calculated by the Mann-Kendall
   method. The trend in DTR is primarily a consequence of greater warming
   in minimum temperature than maximum temperature. In summer, there are
   significant negative correlations between the TCC and DTR in the TP,
   suggesting that the decreases in the DTR are associated with variations
   of TCC in the region. The atmospheric circulation composite analysis
   between strongly positive and negative DTR in summer in the TP reveals
   that during the low DTR period the TP has more water vapour flux,
   stronger temperature advection, and strengthened southerly wind. This
   suggests that the atmospheric circulations have contributed to the
   trends in the DTR, but it is difficult to account for the specific
   contributions. Further investigations of the impact of global warming on
   the DTR in the TP are still required.},

Abstract = {This study represents an attempt to estimate sea surface temperature
   (SST) trends of ten islands along the coastlines of the Gulf of Thailand
   and the Andaman Sea. Satellite-based SST data from September 1981 to
   December 2011 were obtained from Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface
   Temperature version 2 (Daily OISST v. 2) produced at NOAA-NCDC, where
   they were used to analyze moving histograms, coefficients of bimodality
   and linear regression analysis. We found that SST of all study sites had
   significantly increased over the past 30 years, and coefficients of
   bimodality showed that distribution of SST would be bimodal distribution
   rather than unimodal distribution. Results also showed that mass coral
   bleaching events in the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea were likely
   to occur when there were sudden increases in SST over a short period or
   a small increase over a long period due to major El Nino or La Nina
   events roughly every 10 years.},

Journal = {CLIMATE OF THE PAST},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-19},
Abstract = {In this paper temperature series of Japan were statistically analysed in
   order to answer the question whether recent climate change can be proved
   for Japan; the results were compared and discussed with the global
   trends. The observations in Japan started for some stations in the
   1870s, 59 stations are available since 1901, 136 stations since 1959.
   Modern statistical methods were applied, such as: Gaussian binominal
   low-pass filter (30 yr), trend analysis (linear regression model)
   including the trend-to-noise-ratio as measure of significance and the
   non-parametric, non-linear trend test according to MANN (MANN's Q).
   According to the results of the analyses, climate change in Japan is
   clearly shown for temperature over the 100 yr (1901-2000): Annual mean
   temperatures increased at all stations from 0.35 (Hakodate) to 2.95
   degrees C (Tokyo). The magnitude of climate change is illustrated to
   increase over the recent period 1976-2000. Seasonally, the strongest
   warming trends were observed for winter temperatures and also increasing
   temperature trends prevailed in summer, with the exception of slightly
   decreasing trends at only four stations.},

Title = {On the Non-Linear Nature of Long-Term Sea Surface Temperature Global
   Trends},
Journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The year-to-year rate and acceleration of the changes in global sea
   surface temperatures (SSTs) for 1870-2022 are determined using
   non-linear techniques. Our methodology identifies the non-linear,
   long-term tendencies of the warming, revealing subtle but essential
   features of the SST changes that are impossible to identify by linear
   techniques. Our analysis identifies inhomogeneous patterns of SST
   evolution. For instance, in most equatorial regions, including the
   western Pacific, the acceleration of the warming is positive, and
   sustained warming replaces the cooling at the beginning of the records.
   On the contrary, the warming acceleration in the central and eastern
   equatorial Pacific is negative, indicating a sustained warming at the
   beginning of the record that weakens over the years, resulting in a
   stagnated warming or even a cooling in recent years. We identify a
   strong warming with a negative acceleration for the North Atlantic. We
   hypothesize that this warming is part of the multidecadal variability of
   SST rather than a long-term trend.
   We looked at global sea surface temperatures using advanced methods and
   found interesting patterns. Most equatorial regions are warming,
   sustaining an increase after an initial cooling period. However, the
   eastern equatorial Pacific is different-it warms at first but then cools
   down. Also, we spotted substantial warming in the North Atlantic during
   the last 40 years, but it is not a long-term trend; it is part of
   natural temperature variations over decades.
   In most equatorial regions, the warming acceleration is positive,
   indicating, in general, first cooling and then sustained warming The
   eastern equatorial Pacific initially warmed but has since experienced a
   declining warming trend, resulting in recent cooling Recent massive
   warming in the North Atlantic is part of the sea surface temperature
   multidecadal variability rather than a long-term trend},

Abstract = {In recent years, detailed historical records, remote sensing, genomics
   and medical imaging applications as well as the rise of the
   Internet-of-Things present novel data streams. Many of these data are
   instances where functions are more suitable data atoms than traditional
   multivariate vectors. Applied functional data analysis (FDA) presents a
   potentially fruitful but largely unexplored alternative analytics
   framework that can be incorporated directly into a general Big Data
   analytics suite. As an example, we present a modeling approach for the
   dynamics of a functional data set of climatic data. By decomposing
   functions via a functional principal component analysis and functional
   variance process analysis, a robust and informative characterization of
   the data can be derived; this provides insights into the relationship
   between the different modes of variation, their inherent variance
   process as well as their dependencies over time. The model is applied to
   historical data from the Global Historical Climatology Network in
   California, USA. The analysis reveals that climatic time-dependent
   information is jointly carried by the original processes as well as
   their noise/variance decomposition.},

Abstract = {Monthly seasonally adjusted temperatures above latitude 45 degrees N
   were investigated from January 1973 to November 2013. The study area was
   divided into 69 sub-regions of similar size each in the shape of an
   igloo brick. The data were filtered with a second-order autoregressive
   process to remove autocorrelation. Two sub-regions did not have
   sufficient data due to substantial numbers of missing values. Factor
   analysis was then applied to the remaining 67 sub-regions and was used
   to classify regions with similar temperature changes. As a result, 63
   sub-regions could be classified based on 12 factors but 4 sub-regions
   could not be grouped due to uniqueness. The temperatures for each group
   of sub-regions were found to increase during 1973-2013. The largest
   temperature increases of 0.19 degrees C/decade were found in northern
   and southern Siberia and part of the Arctic Ocean. In northern Canada,
   Alaska, the northern Pacific Ocean and eastern Siberia the temperatures
   increased by at least 0.16 degrees C/decade. In Iceland, Norway, Sweden
   and part of the Pacific and Arctic Oceans the temperature increased by
   around 0.15 degrees C/decade. In northeastern Canada, Greenland and its
   surrounding Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean the temperature
   increased by about 0.15 degrees C/decade.},

Abstract = {Large discrepancies exist between twentieth-century tropical
   Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature trends determined from present
   reconstructions. These discrepancies prevent an unambiguous verification
   and validation of climate models used for projections of future climate
   change. Here we demonstrate that a more consistent and robust trend
   among all the reconstructions is found by filtering each data set to
   remove El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is represented not by
   a single-index time series but rather by an evolving dynamical process.
   That is, the discrepancies seem to be largely the result of different
   estimates of ENSO variability in each reconstruction. The robust
   ENSO-residual trend pattern represents a strengthening of the equatorial
   Pacific temperature gradient since 1900, owing to a systematic warming
   trend in the warm pool and weak cooling in the cold tongue. Similarly,
   the ENSO-residual trend in sea-level pressure represents no weakening of
   the equatorial Walker circulation over the same period. Additionally,
   none of the disparate estimates of post-1900 total eastern equatorial
   Pacific sea surface temperature trends are larger than can be generated
   by statistically stationary, stochastically forced empirical models that
   reproduce ENSO evolution in each reconstruction.},

Abstract = {The influence of temperature and glass composition on the
   photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of Er3+ ions embedded in
   (GeS2)(100-x)(Ga2S3)(x) (x = 20, 25 and 33 mol\%) glasses has been
   studied. The typical 4f-4f emission bands of Er3+ ions at around 830,
   1000 and 1550 nm have been observed in the whole investigated
   temperature range from 300 K down to 10 K for all the compositions. New
   4f-4f luminescence bands, in excess of the three basic ones, have been
   observed at 670, 870, 1120, 1260 and 1350 rim for (GeS2)(75)(Ga2S3)(25)
   glass composition, and are tentatively assigned to H-2(9/2) ->
   I-4(11/2), (4)G(11/2) -> F-4(9/2), H-2(11/2) -> I-4(11/2), F-4(7/2) ->
   I-4(9/2) and F-4(3/2) -> I-4(9/2) transitions, respectively. Thus a
   considerable influence of GeGaS host composition on the efficiency of
   4f-4f transitions of embedded Er3+ ions is documented with the outcome
   that (GeS2)(75)Ga2S3)(25) composition appears near optimal for the
   emission efficiency of Er3+ ions. With decreasing temperature the PL
   efficiency is enhanced considerably with pronounced narrowing of all
   bands. In the case of the strongest PL band at similar to 1550 nm,
   corresponding to I-4(13/2) -> I-4(15/2) transition, the narrowing at low
   temperature is further accompanied by the resolution of well pronounced
   fine structure due to ``crystal field{''} splitting of corresponding
   electronic terms. The relationship between the photoluminescence and
   reflectance spectra as a function of Er content has been discussed. (C)

Title = {Spatiotemporal analysis of rainfall and temperature variability and
   trends for a mixed crop-livestock production system: its implications
   for developing adaptation strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 11},
Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to analyze the seasonal
   spatiotemporal climate variability in the Borena zone of Ethiopia and
   its effects on agriculture and livestock production. By examining these
   climate variables in relation to global sea surface temperatures (SST)
   and atmospheric pressure systems, the study seeks to understand the
   underlying mechanisms driving local climate variability. Furthermore, it
   assesses how these climate variations impact crop yields, particularly
   wheat and livestock production, providing valuable insights for
   developing effective adaptation strategies and policies to enhance food
   security and economic stability in the
   region.Design/methodology/approachThe design and methodology of this
   study involve a multifaceted approach to analyzing seasonal
   spatiotemporal climate variability in the Borena zone of Ethiopia. The
   research uses advanced statistical techniques, including rotated
   empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and rotated principal component
   analysis (RPCA), to identify and quantify significant patterns in
   seasonal rainfall, temperature and drought indices over the period from
   1981 to 2022. These methods are used to reveal the spatiotemporal
   variations and trends in climate variables. To understand the causal
   mechanisms behind these variations, the study correlates seasonal
   rainfall data with global SST and examines atmospheric pressure systems
   and wind vectors. In addition, the impact of climate variability on
   agricultural and livestock production is assessed by linking observed
   climate patterns with changes in crop yields, particularly wheat and
   livestock productivity. This comprehensive approach integrates
   statistical analysis with environmental and agricultural data to provide
   a detailed understanding of climate dynamics and their practical
   implications.FindingsThe findings of this study reveal significant
   seasonal spatiotemporal climate variability in the Borena zone of
   Ethiopia, characterized by notable patterns and trends in rainfall,
   temperature and drought indices from 1981 to 2022. The analysis
   identified that over 84\% of the annual rainfall occurs during the March
   to May (MAM) and September to November (SON) seasons, with MAM
   contributing approximately 53\% and SON over 31\%, highlighting these as
   the primary rainfall periods. Significant spatiotemporal variations were
   observed, with northwestern (35.4\%), southern (34.9\%) and northeastern
   (19.3\%) are dominant variability parts of the zone during MAM season,
   similarly southeastern (48.7\%), and northcentral (37.8\%) are dominant
   variability parts of the zone during SON season. Trends indicating that
   certain subregions experience more pronounced changes in climate
   variables in both seasons. Correlation with global SST and an
   examination of atmospheric pressure systems elucidated the mechanisms
   driving these variations, with significant correlation with the southern
   and central part of Indian Ocean. This study also found that
   fluctuations in climate variables significantly impact crop production,
   particularly wheat and livestock productivity in the region,
   underscoring the need for adaptive strategies to mitigate adverse
   effects on agriculture and food security.Research
   limitations/implicationsThe implications of this study highlight the
   need for robust adaptation strategies to mitigate the effects of climate
   variability. Detailed research on seasonal climate patterns and the
   specific behaviors of livestock and crops is essential.
   Gaining a thorough understanding of these dynamics is critical for
   developing resilient adaptation strategies tailored to the unique
   ecological and economic context of the Borana zone. Future research
   should focus on seasonal climate variations and their implications to
   guide sustainable development and livelihood adjustments in the
   region.Originality/valueThis study offers significant originality and
   value by providing a detailed analysis of seasonal spatiotemporal
   climate variability in the Borena zone of Ethiopia, using advanced
   statistical techniques such as rotated EOF and RPCA. By integrating
   these methods with global SST data and atmospheric pressure systems, the
   research delivers a nuanced understanding of how global climatic factors
   influence local weather patterns. The study's novel approach not only
   identifies key trends and patterns in climate variables over an
   extensive historical period but also links these findings to practical
   outcomes in crop and livestock production. This connection is crucial
   for developing targeted adaptation strategies and policies, thereby
   offering actionable insights for enhancing agricultural practices and
   food security in the region. The originality of this work lies in its
   comprehensive analysis and practical relevance, making it a valuable
   contribution to both climate science and regional agricultural planning.},

Journal = {GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {16},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study presents past and projected temporal changes in mean
   temperature and rainfall around the Marsabit Forest Reserve (MFR), a
   sub-humid montane forest in Kenya. Rainfall data for the period
   1961-2014 and temperature data for the period 1972-2011 were acquired
   from the Marsabit meteorological station. Future projections (2006-2100)
   were based on data from five models that participated in the Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Climate simulations for the
   2071-2100 period were compared to the 1961-1990 IPCC baseline period to
   establish significant change. The MFR recorded a mean rainfall of 784 mm
   which declined annually at a rate of 6 mm over the period of the study.
   The long rains (March-May) recorded a mean of 379 mm and decreased
   annually by 10 mm while the short rains (October-December) recorded a
   mean of 269 mm and decreased annually by 2 mm between 1961 and 2014,
   with no statistically significant trend (p > 0.05).
   The model ensemble reproduced the MFR bimodal rainfall pattern, but
   overestimated the short rains at 333 mm, compared to the actual mean of
   269 mm, and underestimated the long rains at 331 mm, compared to the
   actual mean of 379 mm. The model ensemble simulated a historical mean
   rainfall of 651 mm compared to the actual mean of 784 mm. Annual
   rainfall is projected to increase under both scenarios with higher
   increases during the OND season compared to the MAM season and under
   RCP8.5 than under RCP4.5. The mean rainfall in the baseline year was 859
   mm while the mean rainfall in the projection period for the RCP4.5 and
   RCP8.5 scenarios is expected to be 1022 (+19\%) and 1105 (+28.7\%) mm,
   respectively; significant enough to be characterized as climate change.
   Temperatures are projected to increase at a rate of 0.2 degrees C and
   0.5 degrees C per decade under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Between
   2071 and 2100, the MFR is projected to have warmed by between 1.2-1.7
   degrees C and 3.2-4.8 degrees C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively.
   Extreme rainfall events are projected to increase under the RCP4.5
   scenario (severe wetting 13.1\%, severe drying 3\%) and the RCP8.5
   scenario (severe wetting 20.1\%, severe drying 3\%) compared to the
   baseline period (severe wetting 6.1\%). Our results conform to the `East
   African climate paradox', where the observed rainfall trends were
   declining compared to the scenario simulations projecting a wetting
   anomaly as local temperatures rise. Further studies to better understand
   the cause of the poor rainfall simulation in the general circulation
   models (GCMs) in the MFR and the larger East African region will be
   necessary. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The probability distribution function (PDF) of precipitation is expected
   to change under a warmer climate. The existing studies have not been
   able to detect trends in different thresholds of the PDF of extreme
   precipitation series for the contiguous USA. In this study, a fresh
   statistical approach (the Bayesian quantile regression method) was
   employed to analyze trends of annual daily maximum (ADM) and monthly
   maximum (MM) precipitation indices at different quantile levels and
   their teleconnections with large-scale climate patterns over the
   contiguous USA. Historic precipitation time series over the period of 65
   years (1950-2014) for 1108 sites was used for the analysis. To
   investigate the relations between precipitation and large-scale climate
   patterns, two major oscillations {[}the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)] were used as covariates
   in the Bayesian quantile regression model. Our results show that changes
   in upper quantiles of the distributions of the extreme precipitation
   (for both ADM and MM) have occurred at a much higher rate than
   previously believed as compared to the lower quantiles mainly in the
   coastal regions in the eastern half of the country. Variability in the
   spatial distribution of significant trends was observed when either ENSO
   or NAO index was used as a covariate in the Bayesian quantile regression
   model. However, for many regions of the USA, a stronger teleconnection
   between climate indices and precipitation indices for upper quantile
   level was observed as compared to lower quantile levels for both ADM and
   MM. The trends detected using the Bayesian quantile regression method
   were undetected or overlooked by other previously used approaches for
   trend detection. Such results are particularly useful for water managers
   who are more concerned with extreme values rather than the averaged one.},

Abstract = {Industrial emissions of SO2 and NOx, resulting in the formation and
   deposition of sulfuric and nitric acids, affect the health of both
   terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Since the mid-late 20th century,
   legislation to control acid rain precursors in both Europe and the US
   has led to significant declines in both SO4-S and H+ in precipitation
   and streams. However, several authors noted that declines in streamwater
   SO4-S did not result in stoichiometric reductions in stream H+, and
   suggested that observed reductions in base cation inputs in
   precipitation could lessen the effect of air pollution control on
   improving stream pH. We examined long-term precipitation chemistry
   (1978-2010) from nearly 30 sites in the US and Europe that are variably
   affected by acid deposition and that have a variety of industrial and
   land-use histories to (1) quantify trends in SO4-S, H+, NH4-N, Ca, and
   NO3-N, (2) assess stoichiometry between H+ and SO4-S before and after
   1990, and (3) examine regional synchrony of trends. We expected that
   although the overall efforts of developed countries to reduce air
   pollution and acid rain by the mid-late 20th century would tend to
   synchronize precipitation chemistry among regions, geographically varied
   patterns of fossil fuel use and pollution control measures would produce
   important asynchronies among European countries and the United States.
   We also expected that control of particulate versus gaseous emission,
   along with trends in NH3 emissions, would be the two most significant
   factors affecting the stoichiometry between SO4-S and H+. Relationships
   among H+, SO4-S, NH4-N, and cations differed markedly between the US and
   Europe. Controlling for SO4-S levels, H+ in precipitation was
   significantly lower in Europe than in the US, because (1) alkaline dust
   loading from the Sahara/Sahel was greater in Europe than the US, and (2)
   emission of NH3, which neutralizes acidity upon conversion to NH4 (+),
   is generally significantly higher in Europe than in the US. Trends in
   SO4-S and H+ in precipitation were close to stoichometric in the US
   throughout the period of record, but not in Europe, especially eastern
   Europe. Ca in precipitation declined significantly before, but not after
   1990 in most of the US, but Ca declined in eastern Europe even after
   1990. SO4-S in precipitation was only weakly related to fossil fuel
   consumption. The stoichiometry of SO4-S and H+ may be explained in part
   by emission controls, which varied over time and among regions. Control
   of particulate emissions reduces alkaline particles that neutralize acid
   precursors as well as S-containing particulates, reducing SO4-S and Ca
   more steeply than H+, consistent with trends in the northeastern US and
   Europe before 1990. In contrast, control of gaseous SO2 emissions
   results in a stoichiometric relationship between SO4-S and H+,
   consistent with trends in the US and many western European countries,
   especially after 1991. However, in many European countries, declining
   NH3 emissions contributed to the lack of stoichiometry between SO4-S and
   H+.Recent reductions in NOx emissions have also contributed to declines
   in H+ in precipitation.
   Future changes in precipitation acidity are likely to depend on multiple
   factors including trends in NOx and NH3 emission controls, naturally
   occurring dust, and fossil fuel use, with significant implications for
   the health of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {Twenty-five year record of chemicals in open field precipitation and
   throughfall from a medium-altitude forest catchment (Strengbach - NE
   France): An obvious response to atmospheric pollution trends},

Abstract = {This study concerned a 25 yr continuous record of bulk precipitation and
   throughfall composition in a medium-altitude forested environment. The
   1986-2012 survey from the more intense acid rain period in the
   mid-eighties until the present allowed the quantification of the
   interaction between atmospheric deposition and vegetation and the
   long-term evolution following pollutant emission trends.
   The long-term monitoring evidenced some significant temporal trends (pH,
   conductivity, SO42-, Cl-, NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+). Significant
   decreases in the concentrations and fluxes of several ions were observed
   (H+ and SO42-, Cl-, and Ca2+) in open field precipitation and
   throughfalls. The regular and strong decrease in protons and sulfate
   followed the decreases in anthropogenic SO2 and NOx (proton precursors)
   since the 1980s. The decrease in Cl- concentrations was weaker and could
   have been related to the regional reduction in HCl emissions and/or to
   changes in the precipitation regime. The annual calcium fluxes were
   reduced from approximately 15 to 9 and 6 to 2 kg ha(-1) under spruces
   and beeches, respectively, as a consequence of reductions in
   anthropogenic industrial dust. In such calcium-limited resource soils,
   the atmospheric Ca flux exceeded the Ca flux from mineral weathering and
   was highly bioavailable for vegetation growth. This decrease in nutrient
   input had strong consequences for soil nutrients and may thus have
   participated in forest decline.
   The two tree plantations had contrasting effects on the physico-chemical
   parameters of the incoming precipitation with higher water interception
   and chemical concentrations under spruces than under beeches, which
   underlined the role of tree species in atmospheric inputs to soils. The
   structure and persistence of spruce needles enhanced the capture of
   particles and water, accentuating the acidity of the deposition and
   leading to the intensification of acidification processes, nutrient
   leaching in soils and forest decline. In contrast, beech leaves were
   able to neutralize a portion of the atmospheric protons, which minimized
   and reduced the negative effects of acid rain. In addition, the
   throughfalls represented an important part of the biological cycle of
   trees for some elements such as K or N, as indicated by the contrasting
   patterns at year and long-term scales regarding the vegetation type.
   However, our study indicated that the influence of tree species might
   change over time with changes in atmospheric pollution, in precipitation
   regime, or in stand structure.
   This study outlined the importance of the long-term record of open field
   precipitation and throughfalls under various tree types to better
   evaluate the real inputs of elements to forest ecosystems and among
   them, essential mineral nutrients.},

Abstract = {The temperature dependence of the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW)
   stretching exponent beta of shear relaxation kinetics is determined for
   a wide variety of deeply supercooled glass-forming liquids with
   fragility index m ranging between - 30 and 90 using small amplitude
   oscillatory shear parallel plate rheometry. Intriguingly, and contrary
   to conventional wisdom, beta and m are observed to be uncorrelated at
   temperatures close to the glass transition Tg. However, a clear pattern
   emerges when the variation of beta is considered as a function of the
   alpha-relaxation timescale T alpha. In particular, beta is observed to
   increase rapidly (slowly) for relatively strong (fragile) liquids with
   decreasing T alpha upon increasing temperature above Tg. Consequently d
   beta/d(log T alpha) is found to be negatively correlated with m near and
   above Tg. A possible origin of this intriguing trend is discussed within
   the frameworks of the energy landscape and the elastic facilitation
   models of relaxation of supercooled liquids.},

   spatial representativeness, we interpolated the homogenized station data
   onto a dense, regular grid network with the MISH system. In addition, we
   used the ANOVA method to examine the expected values, standard

Title = {Temporal and spatial trend detection of maximum air temperature in Iran
   during 1960-2005},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {111},

Abstract = {Trends of maximum air temperature (T max) were investigated in three
   time scales including annual, seasonal, and monthly time series in 32
   synoptic stations in the whole of Iran during 1960-2005. First,
   nonparametric Mann-Kendall test after removal of the lag-1 serial
   correlation component from the T max time series was used for trend
   detection and spatial distribution of various trends was mapped. Second,
   Sen's slope estimator was used to determine the median slope of positive
   or negative T max trends. Third, 10-year moving average low-pass filter
   was applied to facilitate the trend analysis and the smoothed time
   series derived from the mentioned filter were clustered in three
   clusters for each time series and then were plotted to show their
   spatial distribution patterns in Iran. Results showed that there are
   considerable significant positive trends of T max in warm months
   including April, June, July, August and September and warm seasons.
   These trends can be found in an annual time scale which indicated almost
   50\% positive trends. However, cold months and seasons did not exhibit a
   remarkable significant trend. Although it was rather difficult to detect
   particular spatial distribution of significant trends, some parts in
   west, north-east and south-east and central regions of the country
   showed more positive trends. In an annual time scale. Kermanshah located
   in west regions indicates most change at (+) 0.41 degrees C per decade.
   On the one hand, many clusters of normalized and filtered T max time
   series revealed the increasing trend after 1970 which has dramatically
   risen after around 1990. It is in accordance with many other findings
   for temperature time series from different countries and therefore, it
   can be generated from simultaneous changes in a bigger scale than
   regional one. On the other hand, the concentration of increasing trends
   of T max in warm seasons and their accordance to plants growing season
   in Iran can raise the importance of the role of frequent reported land
   use changes during past decades. Generally, the more sophisticated and
   comprehensive researches are needed to determine the role of different
   factors such as the emission of greenhouse gases and land use changes
   influencing temperature trends in Iran. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {With the recent development of high-quality, digital daily
   air-temperature archives over North America, flexible approaches that
   evaluate trends in time-varying percentiles are capable of estimating
   climate-change parameters from all portions of air-temperature frequency
   distributions. Using these methods, intense warming is found in the
   lowest minimum temperatures over western and central North America.
   During the months of January through March, the lower tail of the daily
   minimum air-temperature distribution over western North America has
   warmed at rates exceeding 3 degreesC/50 yr. Daily maximum air
   temperatures also are increasing over western Canada and Alaska at this
   time, but all parts of the frequency distribution are warming equally.
   Other times of year in western North America, as well as much of eastern
   North America, show little change in either minimum or maximum air
   temperature during the last half-century.},

Title = {Analysis of Recent Mean Temperature Trends and Relationships with
   Teleconnection Patterns in California (US)},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The global mean surface temperature has risen since the late 19th
   century. However, temperatures do not increase uniformly in space or
   time and few studies have focused on that peculiarity in the State of
   California. The aim of this research is to deepen our knowledge of the
   evolution of mean temperatures in the State of California on monthly,
   seasonal and annual time scales. The period under study comprises 40
   years (from 1980 to 2019) and data from 170 meteorological stations were
   analysed. Statistical techniques, including Sen's slope and
   Mann-Kendall, were applied to each of the stations to establish the sign
   and slopes of trends and their statistical significance. The spatial
   distribution of monthly, seasonal and annual trends was analysed using
   the Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) geostatistical technique. The trend
   analysis was also carried out for the State as a whole. This research
   also studies the relationships between mean temperatures and nine
   teleconnection patterns with influence on the Californian climate. To
   find out these links, a correlation analysis was performed using the
   partial non-parametric Spearman Test at a 95\% confidence level. The
   study reveals a positive trend of +0.01 degrees C year(-1) for the whole
   state and that Southern California is getting warmer than Northern
   California for the study period. On a seasonal scale, the local
   temperature increased significantly both in autumn and summer (+0.06
   degrees C and +0.035 degrees C year(-1) respectively) from 1980 to 2019.
   On a monthly scale, the largest increases are found in November at +0.04
   degrees C year(-1). Temperatures in February, March, April and May are
   highly correlated with most of the teleconnection patterns studied in
   the State of California. West Pacific Oscillation (WPO) teleconnection
   pattern has shown the highest negative correlation. However, The Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has a positive correlation with mean
   temperatures in coastal areas such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and
   Monterey. Moreover, Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) and Arctic Oscillation
   patterns (AO) are unlikely to show great influence on average
   temperature trends in California.},

Pages = {1692-1705},

Abstract = {The temporal and spatial distribution of the frequency of breaking
   highest and lowest daily maximum and minimum temperature records over
   the period of 1951-2019 has been investigated for South Africa.
   Temperature records are station specific and defined as either larger or
   smaller than any previous values in a time series of specific year-days.
   Daily maximum and minimum temperatures from homogenized time series of
   25 weather stations in South Africa were analysed. Aspects considered to
   influence the frequency of record-breaking events were the warming trend
   and variance. The study found that the record-breaking frequencies of
   the highest daily maximum (high Tmax) and some high daily minimum
   temperature (high Tmin) records were higher than the theoretically
   expected number in a stationary climate. This was particularly apparent
   near the end of the analysis period. The ratio of highest maximum to
   lowest minimum temperature records was almost an equal 1:1 ratio near
   the start of the analysis period and increased to a about 4:1 in the
   last decade of the period. Focusing on the last decade, that is,
   2010-2019 the study found that there is a different spatial pattern
   between the occurrence of high Tmax and high Tmin records. For high Tmax
   records the highest number were mostly recorded by stations over the
   central parts of the country (e.g., Kimberley, Glen College and
   Bloemfontein). In contrast, the highest number of high Tmin records were
   less confined spatially. Even when considering the general warming due
   to climate change, many more high temperature records are broken than
   expected in certain regions and on average. We deduce that the higher
   than expected numbers of high Tmax and high Tmin records in the latter
   part of the analysis period were mainly due to the variability in the
   warming trend with acceleration in the last decade.},

Title = {Trends in Mean Annual Minimum and Maximum Near Surface Temperature in
   Nairobi City, Kenya},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2010},
Abstract = {This paper examines the long-term urban modification of mean annual
   conditions of near surface temperature in Nairobi City. Data from four
   weather stations situated in Nairobi were collected from the Kenya
   Meteorological Department for the period from 1966 to 1999 inclusive.
   The data included mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures, and was
   first subjected to homogeneity test before analysis. Both linear
   regression and Mann-Kendall rank test were used to discern the mean
   annual trends. Results show that the change of temperature over the
   thirty-four years study period is higher for minimum temperature than
   maximum temperature. The warming trends began earlier and are more
   significant at the urban stations than is the case at the sub-urban
   stations, an indication of the spread of urbanisation from the built-up
   Central Business District (CBD) to the suburbs. The established
   significant warming trends in minimum temperature, which are likely to
   reach higher proportions in future, pose serious challenges on climate
   and urban planning of the city. In particular the effect of increased
   minimum temperature on human physiological comfort, building and urban
   design, wind circulation and air pollution needs to be incorporated in
   future urban planning programmes of the city.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric concentrations of alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane
   (HCH) were measured during 1993-1995 along the St. Lawrence River in
   Quebec, Canada. Average alpha- and gamma-HCH concentrations (pg/m(3))
   were St. Anicet: 93-101; Villeroy: 92-42; Mingan: 96-20, respectively.
   alpha-HCH mean concentrations were similar in all sites and appeared to
   be more influenced by long-range transport than local sources. gamma-HCH
   mean levels in St. Anicet were 2 and 5 times higher than in Villeroy and
   Mingan, respectively. The time-series of gamma-HCH air concentrations at
   St. Anicet and Villeroy were characterised by highly elevated springtime
   episodes, which are in agreement with the gamma-HCH usage in Quebec as
   corn seed dressing pesticide. No temporal trend was observed for the
   alpha-HCH in air. Clausius-Clapeyron plots (log conc. vs. 1/T) showed a
   stronger correlation between temperature and measured gamma-HCH
   concentrations at St. Anicet and Villeroy than Mingan. On a regional
   scale, the influence of the local sources of gamma-HCH implied a
   seasonal variability in air concentrations due to its short transport,
   while at the background site (Mingan), the observed alpha- and gamma-HCH
   concentrations in air were the result of its long-range transport and/or
   water/air gas exchanges. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Trend detection in regional-mean temperature series: Maximum, minimum,
   mean, diurnal range, and SST},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {317-326},

Abstract = {Regional climate trends are of interest both for understanding natural
   climate processes and as tests of anthropogenic climate change
   signatures. Relative to global trends, however, their detection is
   hampered by smaller datasets and the influence of regional climate
   processes such as the Southern Oscillation. Regional trends are often
   presented by authors without demonstration of statistical significance.
   In this paper, regional-average annual series of air temperature and sea
   surface temperature for the New Zealand region are analyzed using a
   systematic statistical approach that selects the optimum statistical
   model (with respect to serial correlation, linearity, etc.), explicitly
   models the interannual variability associated with observable regional
   climate processes, and tests significance. It is found that the
   residuals are stationary and are a red noise process {[}ARMA(1,0)] for
   all the series examined. The SOI and a meridional circulation anomaly
   index (both high-pass filtered) are `'explanatory variables'' for
   interannual variability. For national-average air temperature (AT),
   linear and exponential trend models are equally valid but for simplicity
   the linear model is preferred. Failure to model the serial correlation
   in AT would result in an estimated confidence interval for trend that is
   too small by 36\%. The use of the explanatory variables tightens the
   confidence interval by 15\%.
   Significant trends were detected. The trend in AT for 1896-1994 is 0.11
   +/- 0.035 degrees C decade(-1) (95\% confidence interval). This is about
   double the trend reported for global data, which may be due to the
   relative absence of sulfate aerosols in the South Pacific region. The
   trends in maximum and minimum temperature over this period are not
   statistically different. However, for the later period of 1951-90, the
   trend in maximum temperature reduces to an insignificant value, while
   the trend in minimum temperature remains high, resulting in a
   significant downward trend in diurnal range of 0.10 degrees C
   decade(-1). Similar diurnal range behavior in other regions has been
   tentatively attributed to increasing cloudiness. The trend in a regional
   SST series for 1928-94, 0.07 degrees C decade(-1), is about half the
   trend in AT for the same period. The trend in the difference, SST-AT,
   -0.06 degrees C decade(-1), is statistically significant. This implies
   the existence of an atmospheric warming source for the additional air
   temperature trend, and may mean that the heat fluxes between the
   atmosphere and ocean in the New Zealand region are subject to a large
   trend, with the direction of flux change being toward the ocean. The
   results of the study are consistent with the IPCC predictions of climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Understanding the land surface temperature (LST) trends is crucial for
   policymakers and stakeholders to develop adaptation and mitigation
   strategies suitable for a sustainable environment coping in the face of
   climate change. This article presents a systematic review of the studies
   related to delineating spaceborne sensor-based LST trends, including
   information on the instruments and constellations of satellites
   (missions) that provide thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave
   (PMW) observations. About 99\% of the studies used TIR, where 76\% were
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, onboard
   Terra/Aqua) observations. Opportunities, challenges, and research gaps
   for using the TIR and PMW observations were also explored, with
   instruments onboard either polar-orbiting or geostationary satellites.
   We identified that the calibrated dataset (e.g., processed, harmonized,
   and standardized) is extremely limited for each constellation, with
   multiple satellites and instruments, to make it fully useful for the
   entire mission period. A few problematic methodological concepts were
   identified, including using a few images in a longer time series. Using
   only a few images, acquired on different calendar months in different
   years, would not provide the true annual trends over the study period
   because they can be influenced by seasonal variations. To estimate the
   warming or cooling daytime, nighttime, or diurnal LST trends, the use of
   MODIS observations could be useful, even though it does not acquire
   images during the maximum or minimum temperature in a daily cycle. This
   article indicated further investigations into those research gaps and
   recommended directions to overcome most of these limitations.},

Abstract = {The Arctic has been experiencing unprecedented changes in recent years
   due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions leading to what is known
   as Arctic amplification, whereby the Arctic is warming faster than any
   other area of the planet. While the majority of research has focused on
   the near-surface level heating and radiative forcing, one under-explored
   area of research is the change in temperature and heating rates
   throughout the stratosphere and upper troposphere, particularly during
   the winter months (December-February). For instance, reanalysis data has
   revealed that the Arctic middle-lower stratosphere has been warming at a
   rate of approximately 0.5 K/decade over the 1980-2019 period in contrast
   to the prevailing cooling trends in the other regions of the
   stratosphere. To understand what is driving these non-negligible
   temperature trends, this work investigates the underlying dynamical and
   radiative heating rates over the same 40-year period. It is found that
   dynamics is the main driver of the stratospheric temperature change in
   the Arctic, with the middle-lower stratospheric warming being largely
   explained by trends in adiabatic motion. In comparison, besides the
   dynamical effects, the tropospheric warming trend is also driven
   radiatively by surface warming and thermodynamically by latent heating.
   Lastly, it is found that the stratospheric warming trend mainly occurs
   in the years with sudden stratospheric warming events, highlighting the
   influence of these events in driving the stratospheric temperature
   trends.},

Abstract = {Conventional productions of large volume of hydrogen from fossil based
   resources continue to play a key role in the hydrogen economy. This
   paper recalls the contribution of these conventional technologies with
   new technological development and researches. Providing gradual
   integration of renewable solutions into large-scale production, some
   emerging developments in the use of the renewable based feedstock and
   energy resources in reforming processes in order to bridge the gaps from
   conventional use of fossil feedstock to improve various conversion
   processes were discussed. This paper focuses on high temperature process
   technologies for producing hydrogen via non-renewable resources and
   various industrial technologies and processes (700 degrees C and above)
   for the beneficiation of the available carbonaceous feedstocks like
   natural gas, other hydrocarbons (other fossil based options), coal etc.
   The paper concludes with the analysis of some development gaps in
   hydrogen production from various resources, which interplays between the
   renewable and non-renewable resources as well as likely future trends
   that should be expected in the Gasification hydrogen market in the next
   decades. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Bias correction of climate variables is a standard practice in climate
   change impact (CCI) studies. Various methodologies have been developed
   within the framework of quantile mapping. However, it is well known that
   quantile mapping may significantly modify the long-term statistics due
   to the time dependency of the temperature bias. Here, a method to
   overcome this issue without compromising the day-to-day correction
   statistics is presented. The methodology separates the modeled
   temperature signal into a normalized and a residual component relative
   to the modeled reference period climatology, in order to adjust the
   biases only for the former and preserve the signal of the later. The
   results show that this method allows for the preservation of the
   originally modeled long-term signal in the mean, the standard deviation
   and higher and lower percentiles of temperature. To illustrate the
   improvements, the methodology is tested on daily time series obtained
   from five Euro CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs).},

Abstract = {Decadal-scale trends in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures
   derived from satellite measurements over 1979-2014 are compared with
   ensemble simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model
   (WACCM). The model is forced with observed sea surface temperatures,
   changes in greenhouse gases, and ozone-depleting substances, plus solar
   and volcanic effects, and results from five WACCM realizations (with
   slightly different initial conditions) are analyzed. We focus on the
   vertical structure of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling
   increasing with height, the latitudinal and seasonal dependence of
   trends, and on the temporal evolution of stratospheric temperatures in
   response to stratospheric ozone depletion and partial recovery. The
   model captures the observed trend structure in most respects, and the
   ensemble of simulations provides quantitative estimates of the impact of
   internal variability on trend estimates. In regions of low variability
   (e.g., over low latitudes) the ensemble mean trends agree with the
   observations, while in regions of high variability (e.g., the polar
   stratosphere) the observations mostly fall within the range of
   realizations. Temperature response to evolving stratospheric ozone is
   evaluated by computing separate trends over 1979-1997 (ozone depletion)
   and 1998-2014 (partial recovery). Robust changes in temperature trends
   between these periods occur in the global upper stratosphere and in the
   Antarctic spring lower stratosphere, with consistent behavior between
   model and observations. Observed lower stratospheric temperatures in the
   Antarctic show statistically significant warming after 1998, reflecting
   recently reported healing of the ozone hole.
   Plain Language Summary This work compares temperature trends during
   1979-2014 measured by satellites with results from a state-of-the-art
   chemistry-climate model, incorporating observed forcings including
   observed sea surface temperatures and changes in greenhouse gases and
   ozone-depleting substances, plus solar cycle and volcanic effects. We
   analyze an ensemble of five different model simulations (with slightly
   different initial conditions) to evaluate effects of internal climate
   variability on temperature trends. Temperature trends show good
   quantitative agreement between model and observations, including
   troposphere warming and stratosphere cooling increasing with altitude.
   This agreement demonstrates that the satellite-observed temperature
   changes are a result of known forcings, both natural and anthropogenic.
   Stratospheric temperatures reflect the influence of stratospheric ozone
   depletion and partial recovery, with stronger cooling during the first
   half of the record. Satellite measurements identify a warming of the
   Antarctic lower stratosphere since 1998, as a response to the recently
   reported ``healing{''} of the Antarctic ozone hole.},

Title = {An assessment of three alternatives to linear trends for characterizing
   global atmospheric temperature changes},

Abstract = {Historical changes in global atmospheric temperature are typically
   estimated using simple linear trends. This paper considers three
   alternative simple statistical models, each involving breakpoints (
   abrupt changes): a flat steps model, in which all changes occur
   abruptly; a piecewise linear model; and a sloped steps model,
   incorporating both abrupt changes and slopes during the periods between
   breakpoints. First- and second-order autoregressive models are used in
   combination with each of the above. Goodness of fit of the models is
   evaluated using the Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion. These models
   are applied to the instrumental record of global monthly temperature
   anomalies at the surface and to the radiosonde and satellite records for
   the troposphere and stratosphere. The alternative models often provide a
   better fit to the observations than the simple linear model. Typically
   the two top-performing models have very close values of the Schwarz
   Bayesian Information Criterion. Usually the two models have the same
   basic form and the same net temperature change but with a different
   choice of autoregressive model. However, in some cases the best fits are
   from two different basic models, yielding different net temperature
   changes and suggesting different interpretations of the nature of those
   changes. For the surface data during 1900-2002 the sloped steps and
   piecewise linear models offer the best fits. Results for tropospheric
   data suggest that it is reasonable to consider most of the warming
   during 1958-2001 to have occurred at the time of the abrupt climate
   regime shift in 1977. Two fundamentally different, but equally valid,
   descriptions of stratospheric cooling were found: gradual linear change
   versus more abrupt ratcheting down of temperature concentrated in
   postvolcanic periods (similar to2 years after eruption). Because models
   incorporating abrupt changes can be as explanatory as simple linear
   trends, we suggest consideration of these alternatives in climate change
   detection and attribution studies.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The argument that temperature change and biological change during the
   Ordovician are correlated and, perhaps, causally related has been
   advanced by measurements of delta O-18(phos) values on conodont apatite,
   a phase more resistant to diagenetic alteration than carbonates.
   However, the available conodont delta O-18(phos) records are
   discontinuous and are biased towards North American samples. To test the
   generality of global patterns and to expand the geographical range of
   studied regions, we document delta O-18(phos) values from conodont
   apatite as well as delta C-13 and delta O-18(calcite) values from bulk
   carbonate from New South Wales, Australia. New results span most of the
   Ordovician and include the first Late Ordovician phosphate delta O-18
   values from the Australian continent. The data from New South Wales show
   an similar to 1. 5 parts per thousand(VSMOW) increase in delta
   O-18(phos) values during the Early and Middle Ordovician. This pattern
   matches previously documented trends from Laurentia and central
   Australia, but values in New South Wales are consistently similar to 2.
   5 parts per thousand(VSMOW) lower than those from other regions. We
   attribute these low delta O-18(phos) values to local paleoceanographic
   effects on the seawater delta O-18 value.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of climatic variables has received a great deal of
   attention from researchers recently. The main aim of this study was to
   investigate trends in maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) air
   temperatures in the annual, seasonal and monthly time-scales for 19
   synoptic stations in the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran during
   1966-2005. From the results it is clear that the majority of the trends
   in the annual, seasonal and monthly T-max and T-min time series showed
   increasing tendency during the last decades, while the increasing trends
   in the T-min series were stronger than those in the T-max series. The
   trend in annual T-max and T-min averaged over all 19 stations was 0.090
   and 0.444 degrees C per decade, respectively. The T-max and T-min
   warming trends were more obvious in summer and winter than in autumn and
   spring. On the monthly basis, the highest T-max and T-min in increases
   of 0.827 and 1.585 degrees C per decade were found at the stations
   located in the northeastern corner of the region in January and
   September, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   materials: Drawbacks, advantages and trends},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The obtention of reliable and high performance piezoelectric ceramics
   for uses at high temperatures is still an open issue in the field of
   electroceramics. The materials used nowadays for such applications
   present limitations due to different causes: low piezoelectric
   coefficients, difficulties in processing that lead to the necessary use
   of single crystals, high cost of raw materials and more. In this sense,
   an increasing interest in materials with the so-called Aurivillius-type
   structure has occurred during recent years, due to their relatively high
   piezoelectric coefficients and high ferro-paraelectric phase transition
   temperature. However, some difficulties must be overcome, such as
   processing for obtaining highly dense ceramics and determining their
   real piezoelectric behaviour at high temperature. In this work, a review
   of the processing and properties of ceramics with this structure is
   shown. Effects of the use of precursors obtained by an alternative route
   mechanical activation on the microstruclure are explained. A complete
   piezoelectric characterization at working temperatures (>300 degrees C),
   barely found in the literature, is also shown. The effects of trapped
   charges in the dielectric permittivity and in the piezoelectric radial
   resonance are also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1995},

Abstract = {We compare homogenized series of maximum, minimum, and mean air
   temperature averaged over New Zealand, measured between 1871 and 1993,
   with rigorously quality controlled marine temperature data measured over
   the surrounding ocean surface. The marine data are those of sea-surface
   temperature (SST) and air temperature measured at night (NMAT) on board
   ship, both corrected for time-varying instrumental biases. There is
   mostly very good agreement between the variations in the three data sets
   on time-scales down to a season. Some disagreements are related to short
   periods of sparsely observed marine data, particularly during the World
   Wars. Differences also exist between trends in the maximum and minimum
   New Zealand temperatures (NZT), particularly in winter. In addition,
   interannual variations in winter NZT tend not to track those of nearby
   marine temperatures quite as well as happens in other seasons.
   Although it is not the main purpose of the paper to discuss the causes
   of NZT change, New Zealand temperature is known to be influenced by the
   EI Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena. Tropical East Pacific SST
   variations are strongly related to ENSO and so are well correlated with
   NZT on time-scales of a few years to near a decade. We discuss these
   relationships, and also associations with Southern Hemisphere SST.
   We conclude that annual NZT and NMAT over the nearby ocean surface have
   both warmed by about 0-7 degrees C since the beginning of the century,
   with a slightly smaller increase in SST. This confirms previous work on
   the magnitude of the warming of New Zealand climate this century.
   Warming in NMAT and NZT in each season varies in a similar way, with
   consistently slightly smaller increases in SST. We also conclude that
   the UK Meteorological Office seasonal historical marine temperature data
   set appears to be generally of very good quality in the New Zealand
   region.},

Title = {Intraurban heterogeneity of space-time land surface temperature trends
   in six climate-diverse cities},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {804},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are present in all cities, derived
   from their thermal properties. While looking at the spatiotemporal
   variability of land surface temperature (LST), there is still a gap in
   understanding patterns of change. In this paper, we analysed diurnal and
   nocturnal annual mean LST trends in continental (Beijing), temperate
   (Mexico City and Santiago), and arid (Cairo, Hyderabad, and Riyadh)
   cities employing 1 km MODIS data (2003-2019). Each time-series was
   assessed with the structure of a space-time cube. Hot and cold spots
   were detected for each year and the LST trends were analysed. Each pixel
   was classified into different space-time LST trends and their SUHIs were
   estimated. Cities exhibit trends of increasing temperatures in cold and
   hot spots for diurnal and nocturnal data. Temperatures are increasing
   faster in hot spots for diurnal and in cold spots for nocturnal scenes.
   Steady hot spots and warming hot spots exhibit the highest SUHIs for day
   and night. Our approach provides a framework to empirically delineate
   the spatial intraurban heterogeneity of LST patterns over time. This
   spatially explicit information provides insights into urban areas
   requiring heat mitigation strategies and can be used to monitor the
   performance of measures already implemented for climate adaptation. (c)

Title = {Changes in Temperature Trends and Extremes over Saudi Arabia for the
   Period 1978-2019},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},

Abstract = {Climate change is posing severe threats to human health through its
   impacts on food, water supply, and weather. Saudi Arabia has frequently
   experienced record-breaking climate extremes over the last decade, which
   have had adverse socioeconomic effects on many sectors of the country.
   The present study explores the changes in average temperature and
   temperature extremes over Saudi Arabia using an updated daily
   temperature dataset for the period 1978-2019. Also, changes in frequency
   and percentile trends of extreme events, as well as in absolute
   threshold-based temperature extremes, are analyzed at seasonal and
   annual time scales. The results are robust in showing an increase in
   both temperature trends and temperature extremes averaged over the
   second period (2000-2019) when compared to the first period (1980-1999).
   Over the period 1978-2019, the minimum temperature for the country
   increased (0.64 degrees C per decade) at a higher rate than the maximum
   temperature (0.60 degrees C per decade). The rate of increase in the
   minimum and maximum temperatures was reported as 0.48 and 0.71 degrees C
   per decade, respectively, for the period 1978-2009. The minimum
   temperature increased by 0.81 degrees C per decade for the second period
   compared to an increase of 0.47 degrees C per decade for the first
   period. The significant increase in minimum temperature has resulted in
   a decreasing linear trend in the diurnal temperature range over recent
   decades. The maximum (minimum) temperature increased at a higher rate
   for Jan-Mar (Jun-Nov) with the highest increase of 0.82 (0.89)degrees C
   per decade occurring in March (August). The analysis shows a substantial
   increase (decrease) in the number of warm (cold) days/nights over the
   second period compared to the first period. The number of warm days
   (nights) significantly increased by about 13 (21) days per decade, and
   there is a significant decrease of about 11 (13) days per decade of cold
   days (nights). The seasonal analysis shows that this increase in warm
   days/nights is enhanced in boreal summer, with a reduction in the number
   of cold days/nights in winter. These results indicate that the warming
   climate of Saudi Arabia is accelerating in recent decades, which may
   have severe socioeconomic repercussions in many sectors of the country.},

Title = {Trends and variability in absolute indices of temperature extremes over
   Nigeria: linkage with NAO},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {The present study examines trends in extreme temperature absolute
   indices {[}warmest day (TXx), coldest day (TXn), warmest night (TNx) and
   coldest night (TNn)] using the newly homogenized daily minimum and
   maximum temperature series from 21 stations in Nigeria for the period
   1971-2012. The indices provide an understanding of the characteristics
   of changing temperature, in light of the present anthropogenic global
   warming. Trends in the indices and the statistical significance are
   obtained using the modified Mann-Kendall test in the R-package. The
   results show that many of the stations have significant increasing
   trends in the absolute indices, with the warming most pronounced in
   Southern Nigeria. Averaged over the country, the TXx, TXn, TNx and TNn
   have absolute warming trends of 0.59, 0.17, 0.67and 0.97 degrees C,
   respectively, for the 42 years since 1971. The warming rate is highest
   during the winter (DJF) season for TNn. The present study also examines
   the possible influence of large-scale teleconnection patterns on extreme
   temperature variations by determining the correlation between the
   absolute indices and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index on
   monthly, seasonal and annual timescales. Our results show that warming
   over Nigeria during the dry season months from November to February is
   significantly correlated with NAO. The NAO has significant correlation
   with TXx and TXn in the north, and with TNx and TNn in the south. The
   analysis is repeated with ERA-20C-gridded data set, and similar
   correlations are found. The warming nights, in particular, in Nigeria
   can lead to sleeplessness and widespread mosquito-related diseases as
   the mosquito population and its parasites thrive in warmer conditions.
   The results of the analyses are relevant for decision-making process,
   especially for the development of early warning systems for extreme heat
   events.},

Title = {Trend of Outbreak of Thermal Illness Patients Based on Temperature
   2002-2013 in Korea},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change can have serious impacts on human health, resulting in
   increased healthcare utilization. Many studies on the relationship
   between mortality and temperature exist, but few studies focus on heat
   related outbreaks. Our objective was to verify the relationship between
   ambient temperature and heat related illnesses during the summer months.
   This study analyzed the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS)
   database. Patients with an ICD-10 code T67 (Effects of Heat and Light)
   presenting between May and September were included. Generalized additive
   models (GAM) were used to determine the association between ambient
   temperature and heat related illnesses including differences by region
   and patient age. A total of 335,759 patients with heat related illnesses
   were identified from 2002 to 2013. The number of heat related illnesses
   increased from 14,994 in 2002 to 29,332 in 2013. For every 1 degrees C
   increase in the daily temperature above 29.5 degrees C, the number of
   patients with heat related illnesses also increased (RR 1.060; 95\% CI,
   1.059 to 1.061). In addition, a higher association between temperature
   and outbreaks of heat related to elderly patients (RR 1.084; 95\% CI,
   1.081 to 1.086) and rural patients (RR 1.229; 95\% CI, 1.208 to 1.251)
   was identified. The association between the daily maximum temperature
   and outbreaks of heat related illness is identified. The number of
   patients with heat related illnesses increased over the years and was
   especially noted in elderly and rural patients.},

Abstract = {This paper describes variability in trends of annual tree growth at
   several locations in the high latitudes of Eurasia, providing a wide
   regional comparison over a 2000-year period. The study focuses on the
   nature of local and widespread tree-growth responses to recent warming
   seen in instrumental observations, available in northern regions for
   periods ranging from decades to a century. Instrumental temperature data
   demonstrate differences in seasonal scale of Eurasian warming and the
   complexity and spatial diversity of tree-growing-season trends in recent
   decades. A set of long tree-ring chronologies provides empirical
   evidence of association between inter-annual tree growth and local,
   primarily summer, temperature variability at each location. These data
   show no evidence of a recent breakdown in this association as has been
   found at other high-latitude Northern Hemisphere locations. Using
   Kendall's concordance, we quantify the time-dependent relationship
   between growth trends of the long chronologies as a group. This provides
   strong evidence that the extent of recent widespread warming across
   northwest Eurasia, with respect to 100- to 200-year trends, is
   unprecedented in the last 2000 years. An equivalent analysis of
   simulated temperatures using the HadCM3 model fails to show a similar
   increase in concordance expected as a consequence of anthropogenic
   forcing.},

Title = {Land surface temperature relation with normalized satellite indices for

   land use land cover classes of an arid Potohar region using Landsat data},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},

Abstract = {In terrestrial landscape architecture, land surface temperature (LST) is
   a key estimator of local climate, vegetation growth, and urban
   transition. It also represents the environmental factors that influence
   the land cover patterns using temperature variation over land use land
   cover (LULC) classes. In the present study, various geospatial
   techniques have been implemented to analyze the spatio-temporal trends
   in temperature among different LULC of an arid Potohar region of
   Pakistan using Landsat 7 (ETM+) and 8 (OLI \& TIRS) and the relationship
   between different normalized satellite indices and LST. Results of the
   seasonal fluctuation in winter showed temperature range of 0-57, 0-50,
   04-31 and 7-39 degrees C for the year 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015,
   respectively, while the summer exhibited the temperature range of 24-48,
   27- 57, 22-48, and 12-41 degrees C for the year 2000, 2005, 2010, and
   2015, respectively. The analysis established a direct correlation
   between LST and normalized difference vegetation index and normalized
   difference water index, and an indirect correlation among LST and
   normalized difference soil index, normalized difference built-up index
   and built-up index. The findings are critically important for planning
   and development division for sustainable use of land resources for
   urbanization extension projects. Future research will highlight the
   change in the area occupied by different land featured classes and their
   impacts on LST over a specified period.},

Title = {Trends, Skill, and Sources of Skill in Initialized Climate Forecasts of
   Global Mean Temperature},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {We evaluate the skill and sources of skill in initialized seasonal
   climate forecasts of monthly global mean temperature from the North
   American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) during the period 1991-2024. The
   forecasts demonstrate skill in addition to that from the long-term
   trend, and that skill is primarily attributable to ENSO. However, the
   skill varies seasonally, with skill being lowest for target periods
   during Northern Hemisphere summer. Single model ensembles show
   underdispersion at short leads, while the multi-model ensemble is
   overdispersed, suggesting initial condition errors and highlighting the
   importance of model initialization for quantification of forecast
   uncertainty. Lead-time dependent errors in global mean temperature
   trends appear related to Pacific trend errors. The multi-model mean
   captured the overall trend but underestimated the record-breaking
   temperatures of 2023. Forecasts for the remainder of 2024 indicate
   cooling by the end of the year.},

Title = {Contrasting impacts of net cloud radiative forcing on the surface
   temperature trends in India},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The rise of spatial heterogeneity in surface temperature (T-s) over
   India cannot be explained by only the direct effect of enhanced
   greenhouse gas forcing. Here we propose an analytical framework to
   estimate the impact of the net cloud radiative forcing (CRF) trend on
   the observed T-s trend for the duration of 2000-2019. The cloud
   sensitivity (lambda(cld)) estimated from the satellite observations vary
   in the range -0.180 to 0.241 K per W m(-2) across the seven T-s
   homogeneous zones in India. Net average (+/- 1 sigma) CRFs over the
   Indian landmass during 2000-2019 in the shortwave and longwave are -15.5
   +/- 11.3 and 12.4 +/- 7.4 W m (2 ), -28.1 +/- 22.4 and 24.6 +/- 9.8 W
   m(-2), -75.1 +/- 20.4 and 55.0 +/- 13.8 W m(-2) and -23.3 +/- 14.9 and
   21.6 +/- 14.8 W m(-2), respectively for the winter (Dec-Feb),
   pre-monsoon (Mar- May), monsoon (Jun-Sep) and post-monsoon (Oct-Nov)
   seasons. We find that in some of the T-s homogeneous regions, seasonal
   T-s trends are suppressed, whereas in some other T-s homogeneous
   regions, seasonal T-s trends are accelerated by the net CRF. Our
   framework can be useful in studying the role of clouds in observed
   surface warming trends.},

Abstract = {We have investigated the long-term trends in and variabilities of
   stratospheric ozone, water vapor and temperature over the Indian monsoon
   region using the long-term data constructed from multi-satellite (Upper
   Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS MLS and HALOE, 1993-2005), Aura
   Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS, 2004-2015), Sounding of the Atmosphere
   using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER, 2002-2015) on board TIMED
   (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics)) observations
   covering the period 1993-2015. We have selected two locations, namely,
   Trivandrum (8.4 degrees N, 76.9 degrees E) and New Delhi (28 degrees
   N,77 degrees E), covering northern and southern parts of the Indian
   region. We also used observations from another station, Gadanki (13.5
   degrees N, 79.2 degrees E), for comparison. A decreasing trend in ozone
   associated with NOx chemistry in the tropical middle stratosphere is
   found, and the trend turned to positive in the upper stratosphere.
   Temperature shows a cooling trend in the stratosphere, with a maximum
   around 37 km over Trivandrum (-1.71 +/- 0.49 K decade(-1)) and New Delhi
   (-1.15 +/- 0.55 K decade(-1)). The observed cooling trend in the
   stratosphere over Trivandrum and New Delhi is consistent with Gadanki
   lidar observations during 1998-2011. The water vapor shows a decreasing
   trend in the lower stratosphere and an increasing trend in the middle
   and upper stratosphere. A good correlation between N2O and O-3 is found
   in the middle stratosphere (similar to 10 hPa) and poor correlation in
   the lower stratosphere. There is not much regional difference in the
   water vapor and temperature trends. However, upper stratospheric ozone
   trends over Trivandrum and New Delhi are different. The trend analysis
   carried out by varying the initial year has shown significant changes in
   the estimated trend.},

Abstract = {Climate is a major driver of ecosystem dynamics. In recent years there
   has been considerable interest in future climate change and potential
   impacts on ecosystems and management options. In this paper, we analyzed
   minimum monthly temperature (T min) for ten rural locations in the
   western U.S. sagebrush steppe. Oregon and Nevada each had five
   locations, and the period of record ranged from 69 to 125 years. We used
   structural time series analysis to evaluate trends over time at each
   location. We also used box plots to compare variation within months at
   each location. We concluded: 1) T min variation over years is much
   higher during the winter than during other seasons, 2) there is evidence
   of decadal trends in both directions (hotter and cooler) for most, but
   not all sites, and 3) sites exhibited individualistic patterns rather
   than following a general regional pattern. The analysis shows that sites
   in relatively close proximity can exhibit different temperature patterns
   over time. We suggest that ecologists and land managers make use of any
   available weather data from local weather stations when planning for the
   future or interpreting past changes in plant and animal populations,
   rather than relying on regional averages. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Recently, study in past trends of climate variables gained significant
   consideration because of its contribution in adaptions and mitigation
   strategies for potential future changes in climate, primarily in the
   area of water resource management. Future inter-annual and
   inter-seasonal variations in maximum and minimum temperature may bring
   significant changes in hydrological systems and affect regional water
   resources. The present study has been performed to observe past
   (1970-2010) as well as future (2011-2100) spatial and temporal
   variability in temperature (maximum and minimum) over selected stations
   of Sutlej basin located in North-Western Himalayan region in India. The
   generation of future time series of temperature data at different
   stations is done using statistical downscaling technique. The
   non-parametric test methods, modified Mann-Kendall test and Cumulative
   Sum chart are used for detecting monotonic trend and sequential shift in
   time series of maximum and minimum temperature. Sen's slope estimator
   test is used to detect the magnitude of change over a period of time on
   annual and seasonal basis. The cooling experienced in annual T-Max and
   T-Min at Kasol in past (1970-2010) would be replaced by warming in
   future as increasing trends are detected in T-Max during 2020s and 2050s
   and in T-Min during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s under A1B and A2 scenarios.
   Similar results of warming are also predicted at Sunni for annual T-Min
   in future under both scenarios which witnessed cooling during 1970-2010.
   The rise in T-Min at Rampur is predicted to be continued in future as
   increasing trends are obtained under both the scenarios. Seasonal trend
   analysis reveals large variability in trends of T-Max and T-Min over
   these stations for the future periods.},

Volume = {83},
Number = {1-4, SI},

Abstract = {We take advantage of the longest high quality single-sensor global data
   set of ocean color available today to explore recent trends in the
   primary productivity of the main eastern boundary upwelling systems
   (EBUEs): California, Canary, Humboldt and Benguela. The chlorophyll-a
   concentration is used as a proxy for primary production. SST data from
   AVHRR and wind speed data from QuikSCAT are used in conjunction with
   this data set to analyse forcing mechanisms explaining the chlorophyll
   biomass.
   Whereas the worldwide prima ry-production biomass shows on average
   decreasing trends, as already observed in the stratified part of the
   worldwide ocean, the productivity of most EBUEs increases during the
   study period. These contrasting trends are both significant, at least
   for the mid latitude range of 50 degrees S-50 degrees N, where the data
   coverage is sufficient for accurate estimation.
   Probably due to the large scale atmospheric forcing, trends in sea
   surface temperature (SST) show nonsignificant relationships with the
   trends in biomass within upwelling systems, suggesting that SST
   anomalies cannot be used as an indicator of change in upwelling
   intensity in a continuous warming context. On the other hand, upwelling
   favourable equatorward winds show a significant correlation with the
   observed trends in biomass, suggesting that the trends in the trade
   winds are probably linked to an increase in the intensity of the Hadley
   cell circulation observed during the last several decades. (C) 2009

Abstract = {Two Himalayan ice cores display a factor-two decreasing trend of air
   content over the past two millennia, in contrast to the relatively
   stable values in Greenland and Antarctica ice cores over the same
   period. Because the air content can be related with the relative
   frequency and intensity of melt phenomena, its variations along the
   Himalayan ice cores provide an indication of summer temperature trend.
   Our reconstruction point toward an unprecedented warming trend in the
   20th century but does not depict the usual trends associated with
   ``Medieval Warm Period{''} (MWP), or ``Little Ice Age{''} (LIA).},

Title = {Surface Temperature trends in the Mediterranean Sea from MODIS data
   during years 2003-2019},
Journal = {REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Sea Surface Temperature is a variable recognized as an Essential Climate
   Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observation System (GCOS), due to
   its determinant influence on climate dynamics, from micro scale to
   global levels The aim of this paper is to estimate Sea Surface
   Temperature trends in the Mediterranean Sea during years 2003-2019 by
   using the MODIS Level 3 SST Thermal IR 8 Day 4km V2019.0. Results show
   an SST increase of 0.040 +/- 0.001 degrees C/yr. The seasonal maximum
   trend is associated to summer 0.070 +/- 0.001 degrees C/yr, followed by
   winter, (0.040 +/- 0.001) degrees C/yr, autumn 0.030 +/- 0.001 degrees
   C/yr and spring, 0.020 +/- 0.001 degrees C/yr. The total period analyzed
   has been divided into ten-year time spans, showing a stable increase of
   0.055 degrees C/yr in average, from period 2005-2014 onwards. In
   absolute SST values terms, the parameter range is of 0.85 degrees C from
   year 2005 to 2019. We have also analyzed the spatial variability of the
   parameter by dividing the Mediterranean Sea into nine sub-basins:
   Alboran Sea, Balearic Sea (Iberian Sea), Mediterranean Western Basin,
   Mediterranean Eastern Basin, Ligurian Sea, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea,
   Adriatic Sea and Aegean Sea. The results show warming trends from 0.02
   degrees C/yr for the Alboran Sea to 0.07 degrees C/yr for the Adriatic
   Sea. Results have been validated by using data from a local
   observational buoy system, obtaining a coefficient of determination of
   0.97. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open

Abstract = {Decadal trends of continuous seasonal maximum and minimum air
   temperature and air temperature range are analyzed by elevation within
   the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States.
   Temperature data included spanned December 1969 to November 2018 and
   were obtained from the quality controlled Global Historical Climatology
   Network-monthly, version 4. Linear least squares regression indicates
   statistically-significant warming trends with minimum seasonal air
   temperature typically increasing more than maximum seasonal air
   temperature, reflecting a decrease of the air temperature range with
   time, particularly during the boreal meteorological winter, spring, and
   summer seasons. Regressions of station decadal trends versus station
   elevation illustrate the presence of elevation-dependent warming with
   the magnitude of decadal temperature trends decreasing as station
   elevation increases, at least up to 850 m above mean sea leveL As a
   result, the regional vertical temperature lapse rate was also found to
   increase with time, suggesting the possibility for precipitation and
   convection lift implications. From a biogeography standpoint, the
   increasing vertical temperature gradient may imply an acceleration of
   species upslope migration with time.},

Title = {Intercomparison of temperature trends in IPCC CMIP5 simulations with
   observations, reanalyses and CMIP3 models},
Journal = {GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1705-1714},
Abstract = {On the basis of the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)
   and the climate model simulations covering 1979 through 2005, the
   temperature trends and their uncertainties have been examined to note
   the similarities or differences compared to the radiosonde observations,
   reanalyses and the third Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3)
   simulations. The results show noticeable discrepancies for the estimated
   temperature trends in the four data groups (radiosonde, reanalysis,
   CMIP3 and CMIP5), although similarities can be observed.
   Compared to the CMIP3 model simulations, the simulations in some of the
   CMIP5 models were improved. The CMIP5 models displayed a negative
   temperature trend in the stratosphere closer to the strong negative
   trend seen in the observations. However, the positive tropospheric trend
   in the tropics is overestimated by the CMIP5 models relative to CMIP3
   models. While some of the models produce temperature trend patterns more
   highly correlated with the observed patterns in CMIP5, the other models
   (such as CCSM4 and IPSL\_CM5A-LR) exhibit the reverse tendency. The
   CMIP5 temperature trend uncertainty was significantly reduced in most
   areas, especially in the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere, compared to
   the CMIP3 simulations.
   Similar to the CMIP3, the CMIP5 simulations overestimated the
   tropospheric warming in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere and
   underestimated the stratospheric cooling. The crossover point where
   tropospheric warming changes into stratospheric cooling occurred near
   100 hPa in the tropics, which is higher than in the radiosonde and
   reanalysis data. The result is likely related to the overestimation of
   convective activity over the tropical areas in both the CMIP3 and CMIP5
   models.
   Generally, for the temperature trend estimates associated with the
   numerical models including the reanalyses and global climate models, the
   uncertainty in the stratosphere is much larger than that in the
   troposphere, and the uncertainty in the Antarctic is the largest. In
   addition, note that the reanalyses show the largest uncertainty in the
   lower tropical stratosphere, and the CMIP3 simulations show the largest
   uncertainty in both the south and north polar regions.},

Abstract = {The occurrence of regional temperature extremes on weekly to seasonal
   time scales has been a common climate impact in recent decades. Both
   instances of extreme warmth and extreme cold have been documented and
   analysed in the literature. While these events have most often been
   analysed independently, in this study, the transition between
   temperature extremes is examined using station data. Five measures of
   extreme temperature change are examined. At stations across the United
   States, there has been a significant decrease in the temperature
   difference between the warmest and coldest percentile observed within
   each year based on 7-, 30- and 90-day temperature averages during both
   the 1900-2017 and 1950-2017 periods. The maximum difference between
   percentiles associated with adjacent 7-, 30- and 90-day periods in each
   year has also declined significantly. At the same time, the interval
   between the highest and lowest annual percentile occurrence has
   lengthened. On a decadal basis, the frequency of shifts from the sub-5th
   to over-95th temperature percentiles has also declined through time,
   while the average time period between temperature occurrences in
   opposite tails of the distribution has increased. In general, these
   results are very consistent across the United States, although some
   regional- and duration-dependent differences are noted. For many of the
   extreme temperature metrics, a high level of field significance is
   obtained in the Southwest, Great Plains and Midwest regions.},

Title = {Temperature trends during the Present and Last Interglacial periods - a

Abstract = {Though primarily driven by insolation changes associated with well-known
   variations in Earth's astronomical parameters, the response of the
   climate system during interglacials includes a diversity of feedbacks
   involving the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, vegetation and land ice. A
   thorough multi-model-data comparison is essential to assess the ability
   of climate models to resolve interglacial temperature trends and to help
   in understanding the recorded climatic signal and the underlying climate
   dynamics. We present the first multi-model-data comparison of transient
   millennial-scale temperature changes through two intervals of the
   Present Interglacial (PIG; 8-1.2 ka) and the Last Interglacial (LIG;
   123-116.2 ka) periods. We include temperature trends simulated by 9
   different climate models, alkenone-based temperature reconstructions
   from 117 globally distributed locations (about 45\% of them within the
   LIG) and 12 ice-core-based temperature trends from Greenland and
   Antarctica (50\% of them within the LIG). The definitions of these
   specific interglacial intervals enable a consistent inter-comparison of
   the two intervals because both are characterised by minor changes in
   atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and more importantly by
   insolation trends that show clear similarities.
   Our analysis shows that in general the reconstructed PIG and LIG
   Northern Hemisphere mid-to-high latitude cooling compares well with
   multi-model, mean-temperature trends for the warmest months and that
   these cooling trends reflect a linear response to the warmest-month
   insolation decrease over the interglacial intervals. The most notable
   exception is the strong LIG cooling trend reconstructed from Greenland
   ice cores that is not simulated by any of the models. A striking
   model-data mismatch is found for both the PIG and the LIG over large
   parts of the mid-to-high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere where the
   data depicts negative temperature trends that are not in agreement with
   near zero trends in the simulations. In this area, the positive local
   summer insolation trend is counteracted in climate models by an
   enhancement of the Southern Ocean summer sea-ice cover and/or an
   increase in Southern Ocean upwelling. If the general picture emerging
   from reconstructions is realistic, then the model-data mismatch in mid
   and high Southern Hemisphere latitudes implies that none of the models
   is able to resolve the correct balance of these feedbacks, or,
   alternatively, that interglacial Southern Hemisphere temperature trends
   are driven by mechanisms which are not included in the transient
   simulations, such as changes in the Antarctic ice sheet or
   meltwater-induced changes in the overturning circulation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {We study the regional variation of temperature trends (warming or
   cooling) over Western India and the contribution of land-use and
   land-cover (LULC) changes towards this warming or cooling based on
   temperature datasets of 37 years (1973-2009). The contribution of LULC
   to the warming or cooling is estimated based on deviation in temperature
   in the observation and reanalysis datasets. The observed temperature
   dataset indicates that Western India is getting warmer by 0.13 degrees C
   per decade. This warming is the combined effect of increase in
   concentration of greenhouse gases and LULC changes. The impact of LULC
   changes on temperature trends over Western India is estimated using
   `observation minus reanalysis' method. The results indicate that the
   LULC changes have contributed to warming over this region by 0.06
   degrees C per decade. Comparison of the change in temperature trend with
   the change in LULC indicates warming due to LULC changes because of the
   reduction of area under open forest and subsequent increase of the area
   under agricultural land. The study highlights the impact of land-use
   change to be more significant and the utility of satellite data for
   periodic LULC studies in climate change research.},

Abstract = {Bearing temperature trending is an ongoing problem that is receiving
   considerable attention in the railroad industry. Currently, bearings
   that display this phenomenon arc removed from service since a trended
   bearing exhibits similar behavior to a bum-off bearing at the end of its
   life. The removal and replacement of these bearings is a costly process,
   in addition to causing undesirable time delays. Even though this topic
   has received ample attention, to date, research efforts have been unable
   to identify the mechanism(s), or the root cause(s), of this troubling
   phenomenon. Motivated by the latter, the study presented here focuses on
   identifying the root cause of the bearing temperature trending seen in
   service. To this effect, eight laboratory experiments were performed
   using three bearings that had been removed from service due to
   temperature trending, along with their mates. Laboratory experiments
   were performed on a test rig that accommodates four Class F bearings
   simultaneously rotating at a speed of 536 rpm, which corresponds to a
   train traveling with a velocity of approximately 57 mph (91.7 km/h). The
   laboratory study was successful in duplicating the bearing temperature
   trending phenomenon seen in service, and consequently identifying the
   main source of this problem. Data presented will include both
   temperature and vibration profiles measured during normal and trending
   phases, along with inspection results.},

Title = {Interannual, solar cycle, and trend terms in middle atmospheric

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {110},
Number = {D6},
Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {{[}1] Temperature versus pressure or T(p) time series from the Halogen
   Occultation Experiment (HALOE) have been generated and analyzed for the
   period of 1991-2004 and for the mesosphere and upper stratosphere for
   latitude zones from 40N to 40S. Multiple linear regression (MLR)
   techniques were used for the analysis of the seasonal and the
   significant interannual and solar cycle (or decadal-scale) terms. An
   11-yr solar cycle (SC) term of amplitude 0.5 to 1.7 K was found for the
   middle to upper mesosphere; its phase was determined by a Fourier fit to
   the de-seasonalized residual. This SC term is largest and has a lag of
   several years for northern hemisphere middle latitudes of the middle
   mesosphere, perhaps due to the interfering effects of wintertime wave
   dissipation. The SC response from the MLR models is weaker but
   essentially in-phase at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere. An
   in-phase SC response term is also significant near the tropical
   stratopause with an amplitude of about 0.4 to 0.6 K, which is somewhat
   less than predicted from models. Both sub-biennial (688-dy) and QBO
   (800-dy) terms are resolved for the mid to upper stratosphere along with
   a decadal-scale term that is presumed to have a 13.5-yr period due to
   their predicted modulation. This decadal-scale term is out-of-phase with
   the SC during 1991-2004. However, the true nature and source of this
   term is still uncertain, especially at 5 hPa. Significant linear cooling
   trends ranging from -0.3 K to -1.1 K per decade were found in the
   tropical upper stratosphere and subtropical mesosphere. Trends have not
   emerged so far for the tropical mesosphere, so it is concluded that the
   cooling rates that have been resolved for the subtropics are likely
   upper limits. As HALOE-like measurements continue and their time series
   lengthen, it is anticipated that better accuracy can be achieved for
   these interannual, SC, and trend terms.},

Title = {Modulated Trends in Arctic Surface Air Temperature Extremes as a
   Fingerprint of Climate Change},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {37},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2381-2404},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Strengthened by polar amplification, Arctic warming provides direct
   evidence for global climate change. This analysis shows how Arctic
   surface air temperature (SAT) extremes have changed throughout time.
   Using ERA5, we demonstrate a pan-Arctic (>60 degrees N) significant
   upward SAT trend of +0.62 degrees C decade(-1) since 1979. Due to this
   warming, the warmest days of each month in the 1980s to 1990s would be
   considered average today, while the present coldest days would be
   regarded as normal in the 1980s to 1990s. Over 1979-2021, there was a 2
   degrees C (or 7\%) reduction of pan-Arctic SAT seasonal cycle, which
   resulted in warming of the cold SAT extremes by a factor of 2 relative
   to the SAT trend and dampened trends of the warm SAT extremes by roughly
   25\%. Since 1979, autumn has seen the strongest increasing trends in
   daily maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as counts of days with
   SAT above the 90th percentile and decreasing trends in counts of days
   with SAT below the 10th percentile, consistent with rapid Arctic sea ice
   decline and enhanced air-ocean heat fluxes. The modulated SAT seasonal
   signal has a significant impact on the timing of extremely strong
   monthly cold and warm spells. The dampening of the SAT seasonal
   fluctuations is likely to continue to increase as more sea ice melts and
   upper-ocean warming persists. As a result, the Arctic winter cold SAT
   extremes may continue to exhibit a faster rate of change than that of
   the summer warm SAT extremes as the Arctic continues to warm.},

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {136-147},

Abstract = {We analyze trends in temperature from 18 temperature stations and one
   upper air sounding site at 30-35 S in central Chile between 1979-2015,
   to explore geographical and season temperature trends and their
   controls, using regional ocean-atmosphere indices. Significant warming
   trends are widespread at inland stations, while trends are
   non-significant or negative at coastal sites, as found in previous
   studies. However, ubiquitous warming across the region in the past 8
   years, suggests the recent period of coastal cooling has ended.
   Significant warming trends are largely restricted to austral spring,
   summer and autumn seasons, with very few significant positive or
   negative trends in winter identified. Autumn warming is notably strong
   in the Andes, which, together with significant warming in spring, could
   help to explain the negative mass balance of snow and glaciers in the
   region. A strong Pacific maritime influence on regional temperature
   trends is inferred through correlation with the Interdecadal Pacific
   Oscillation (IPO) index and coastal sea surface temperature, but the
   strength of this influence rapidly diminishes inland, and the majority
   of valley, and all Andes, sites are independent of the IPO index.
   Instead, valley and Andes sites, and mid-troposphere temperature in the
   coastal radiosonde profile, show correlation with the autumn Antarctic
   Oscillation which, in its current positive phase, promotes subsidence
   and warming at the latitude of central Chile.},

   global-mean temperature trends},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The recent slowdown in the rate of increase in global-mean surface
   temperature (GMST) has generated extensive discussion, but little
   attention has been given to the contribution of time-varying trends in
   greenhouse gas concentrations. We use a simple model approach to
   quantify this contribution. Between 1985 and 2003, greenhouse gases
   (including well-mixed greenhouse gases, tropospheric and stratospheric
   ozone, and stratospheric water vapour from methane oxidation) caused a
   reduction in GMST trend of around 0.03-0.05 K decade(-1) which is around
   18\%-25\% of the observed trend over that period. The main contributors
   to this reduction are the rapid change in the growth rates of
   ozone-depleting gases (with this contribution slightly opposed by
   stratospheric ozone depletion itself) and the weakening in growth rates
   of methane and tropospheric ozone radiative forcing. Although CO2 is the
   dominant greenhouse gas contributor to GMST trends, the continued
   increase in CO2 concentrations offsets only about 30\% of the simulated
   trend reduction due to these other contributors. These results emphasize
   that trends in non-CO2 greenhouse gas concentrations can make
   significant positive and negative contributions to changes in the rate
   of warming, and that they need to be considered more closely in analyses
   of the causes of such variations.},

Abstract = {Temperature and salinity data in the historical record are scarce and
   unevenly distributed in space and time and the estimation of linear
   trends is sensitive to different factors. In the case of the Western
   Mediterranean, previous works have studied the sensitivity of these
   trends to the use of bathythermograph data, the averaging methods or the
   way in which gaps in time series are dealt with. In this work, a new
   factor is analysed: the effect of data interpolation. Temperature and
   salinity time series are generated averaging existing data over certain
   geographical areas and also by means of interpolation. Linear trends
   from both types of time series are compared. There are some differences
   between both estimations for some layers and geographical areas, whilst
   in other cases the results are consistent. Those results which do not
   depend on the use of interpolated or non-interpolated data and are not
   influenced by data analysis methods can be considered as robust ones.
   Those results influenced by the interpolation process or the factors
   analysed in previous sensitivity tests are not considered as robust
   results.},

Abstract = {The northernmost conifers in the world are located well above the Arctic
   Circle in the Taymir region of northern Siberia and have been recording
   the thermal environment for centuries to millennia. The trees respond to
   temperatures beyond the narrow season of actual cambial cell division by
   means of root growth, photosynthesis, lignification of cell walls, and
   other biochemical processes. Data from annual tree-ring widths are used
   to reconstruct May-September mean temperatures for the past four
   centuries. These warm-season temperatures correlate with annual
   temperatures and indicate unusual warming in the 20th century. However,
   there is a loss of thermal response in ring widths since about 1970,
   Previously the warmer temperatures induced wider rings. Most major
   warming and cooling trends are in agreement with other high-latitude
   temperature reconstructions based on tree-ring analyses with some
   regional differences in timing of cooling in the late 18th century and
   of warming in the late 19th century. (C) 2000 University of Washington.},

Abstract = {Tropospheric aerosols increase the shortwave reflectivity of the
   Earth-atmosphere system both by scattering light directly, in the
   absence of clouds, and by enhancing cloud reflectivity. The radiative
   forcing of climate exerted by anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, derived
   mainly from SO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion, is opposite that
   due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases and is estimated to be of
   comparable average magnitude in Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes.
   However, persuasive evidence of climate response to this forcing has
   thus far been lacking. Here we examine patterns of seasonal and
   latitudinal variations in temperature anomaly trend for evidence of such
   a response. Pronounced minima in the rate of temperature increase in
   summer months in Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes are consistent with
   the latitudinal distribution of anthropogenic sulfate and changes in the
   rate of SO2 emissions over the industrial era.},

Title = {Nonsignificant elevational trends of soil microbial respiration and
   temperature sensitivity in a subtropical forest},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil carbon (C) cycling plays a critical role in regulating global C
   budget and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The ongoing global warming
   potentially accelerates soil C loss induced by microbial respiration
   (MR) and makes soil a large C source to the atmosphere. Quantifying the
   drivers of MR and its response to rising temperature (also called
   temperature sensitivity, Q10) should be a high priority to improve the
   modeling and prediction of terrestrial C cycle under global warming. In
   this study, we applied a standardized soil sampling along nine gradients
   from 410 to 1080 m in a subtropical forest in southern China. All soil
   samples were incubated at varying temperature gradients
   (10-15-20-25-20-15 degrees C) to measure MR and Q10 every day for three
   weeks. Then all the measured MR was adjusted by the field temperature of
   each elevation gradient. Our objectives were to examine the response of
   MR and Q10 to the environmental change induced by elevational gradients
   in the subtropical forest and then quantify their main drivers. We
   totally collected 54 abiotic and biotic factors relative to the MR and
   Q10. Our results showed that the incubated MR increased from low to high
   elevation. However, a significant elevation trend of the adjusted MR was
   not examined after adjusting the field temperature of sampling sites,
   due to the trade-off between increasing soil C concentration and
   declining temperature as elevation increased. We further found that the
   elevational gradients did not cause significant change in Q10. The
   variation in Q10 was negatively dominated by soil C quality, which
   declined nonlinearly along the elevation gradients. This study
   highlights the trade-off between environment and biotic factors in
   determining soil C decomposition along elevational gradients. The
   uncertainty of MR measurements caused by unifying incubated temperature
   should not be ignored in future model development.},

Abstract = {Conducting an in-depth quantification of warming conditions in a given
   region is crucially conducive to devising more informed, credible, and
   effective climate actions. The traditional approach commonly is to apply
   a single monotonic trend test for specified beginning and ending times
   within a predetermined period, which is sensitive to the analyzed
   period. Thus, the present study aimed to apply multiple non-parametric
   statistical trend tests to the observed daily mean, maximum, and minimum
   temperature records at 12 sites located proportionally to the whole
   extent of the Central Highlands, Vietnam. This approach was implemented
   by performing Sen's slope estimator and block bootstrapping Mann-Kendall
   tests repeatedly with various beginning and ending years for all
   possible periods of at least 10 years in length during 1980-2019. This
   study also delved into non-monotonic trend components in temperature
   means and extremes by employing an innovative trend analysis (ITA)
   methodology. The outcomes indicated significant warming trends in the
   annual mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures, with the estimated trend
   slopes varying mainly from 0.30-0.43, 0.09-0.25, and 0.41-0.52 degrees
   C/decade, respectively. Most extreme temperature indices (i.e., Max
   Tmin, Min Tmin, warm spell duration indicator, warm days/nights) were
   characterized mainly by positive trends. The results also pointed out
   higher warming levels in the annual mean and minimum temperatures than
   the annual maximum one, and likewise, most extreme temperature indices
   deriving from daily minimum temperature exhibited faster rates than
   those from maximum one. These findings highlight the superiority of
   applying the multiple trend tests and ITA method to clarify temporal
   trend patterns.},

Abstract = {This study summarized upper-air temperature change trends based on the
   monthly datasets of 14 sounding stations in the arid region of Northwest
   China during 1960-2009. Over the investigated period, the change in
   upper-air temperature measured at eight standard pressure levels shows
   that an obvious warming at 850-400 hPa, which decreases with altitude,
   changes to an apparent cooling at 300-50 hPa. There is a positive
   correlation between the surface and 850-300-hPa temperatures, but a
   negative correlation between the surface and 200-50-hPa temperatures.
   Over the full 1960-2009 record, patterns of statistically significant
   mid-lower tropospheric warming and upper tropospheric and mid-lower
   stratospheric cooling are clearly evident. Also, the annual temperature
   cycle indicates that the peak temperature shifts from July in the
   troposphere to February in the mid-lower stratosphere, suggesting the
   importance of seasonal trend analysis. We found that the warming in the
   mid-lower troposphere is more pronounced during the summer, autumn, and
   winter, whereas the cooling in the upper troposphere and mid-lower
   stratosphere is larger during the summer and autumn. Furthermore, there
   are also many regional differences in the upper-air temperature change,
   regardless of both season and layer.},

Title = {Forcing of anthropogenic aerosols on temperature trends of the
   sub-thermocline southern Indian Ocean},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {In the late twentieth century, the sub-thermocline waters of the
   southern tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean experienced a sharp
   cooling. This cooling has been previously attributed to an anthropogenic
   aerosol-induced strengthening of the global ocean conveyor, which
   transfers heat from the subtropical gyre latitudes toward the North
   Atlantic. From the mid-1990s the sub-thermocline southern Indian Ocean
   experienced a rapid temperature trend reversal. Here we show, using
   climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project, that the late twentieth century sub-thermocline cooling of the
   southern Indian Ocean was primarily driven by increasing anthropogenic
   aerosols and greenhouse gases. The models simulate a slow-down in the
   sub-thermocline cooling followed by a rapid warming towards the mid
   twenty-first century. The simulated evolution of the Indian Ocean
   temperature trend is linked with the peak in aerosols and their
   subsequent decline in the twenty-first century, reinforcing the
   hypothesis that aerosols influence ocean circulation trends.},

Abstract = {Monthly mean (TEM), maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) surface air
   temperatures at 119 meteorological stations on the Yunnan Plateau (YP,
   Southwest China) were analysed for temporal trends and spatial variation
   patterns during the period 1961-2004. Linear trend analyses revealed
   that annual temperature over the YP increased at a rate of 0.3 degrees
   C/decade during the period 1961-2004, while warming trend of 0.33
   degrees C/decade and 0.26 degrees C/decade was observed for winter and
   summer temperatures, respectively. Warming trends of nighttime minimum
   temperature are more pronounced than those of daytime maximum
   temperature, especially during winter season. Consequently, a decreasing
   trend of diurnal temperature ranges (DTR = T-max - T-min) was observed.
   Five spatial patterns of temperature variability were objectively
   defined by rotated empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, which
   are associated with distinct temporal temperature variations and
   geographical area over the YP. Annual temperature increases were found
   to be most pronounced in the southern and northwestern (high-elevation)
   parts of the YP, whereas the hot-dry valleys along the Yangtze and Red
   River basins experienced cooling during the past four decades. Copyright

Abstract = {Besides gradually, climate can also change abruptly. The global surface
   temperature series is a major indicator of such changes. Using rigorous
   statistical tools, we show that during the twentieth century the time
   series of annual Northern Hemisphere surface temperature is well
   described by a trend-stationary process, but the trend line breaks in
   1963. After six transitory years, in 1970, the temperature course locks
   up into a new regime with a triple linear warming rate. For the
   emergence and abruptness of the break we reveal the key roles of the
   Mount Agung eruption and the interannual to interdecadal changes of the
   major modes and patterns of climate variability. We offer an abrupt
   climate shift scenario based on the adaptivity of climatic regimes
   against instant external forcings. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal

Abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important parameter for the study of
   oceanic environment. In this study we used the SST data derived from the
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series satellites to study
   the SST trends in the waters adjacent to Taiwan from 1982 to 2003. The
   Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method was employed to retrieve the
   trend. Results show that the SST in the waters adjacent to Taiwan had a
   warming trend of about 0.50degreesC/decade and 0.47degreesC/decade in
   the Taiwan Strait and in the Kuroshio region east of Taiwan,
   respectively. The warming trend in winter is much higher than that in
   summer. This could be the reason why the people who live in Taiwan felt
   warm winter in recent years. The waters adjacent to Taiwan are also
   located at the high warming trend areas in the world. They are much
   higher than the mean trend of global ocean. Not only the waters around
   Taiwan are in the high warming areas, but also the oceans around China
   are. The high warming areas in the China oceans seem to be related to
   the distribution of atmospheric aerosols in the western Pacific Ocean.},

Abstract = {A one-dimensional radiative transfer model with fixed dynamical heating
   is used to calculate the approximate latitude and seasonal dependences
   of lower stratospheric temperature changes associated with observed
   ozone trends. The spatial and temporal distribution of ozone profile
   trends in the lower stratosphere is estimated from a combination of
   Nimbus 7 Solar Backscattered Ultraviolet (SBUV) global measurements of
   the ozone column below 32 mbar for the period 1979-1990 and balloon
   ozonesonde profile trends at northern middle latitudes. The calculated
   temperature trends near 100 mbar compare favorably with diose recently
   derived by Randel and Cobb {[}1994] using data from Channel 4 of the
   Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) on the NOAA operational satellites,
   although a number of quantitative differences are found. An independent
   analysis reported here of 100 mbar temperatures derived from northern
   hemisphere radiosonde data at the Free University of Berlin supports the
   validity of the satellite-derived lower stratospheric temperature
   trends. These results are therefore generally consistent with the
   hypothesis that observed lower stratospheric cooling trends are
   predominantly determined by reductions in radiative beating associated
   with stratospheric ozone depletion.},

Title = {Observed divergence in the trends of temperature controls on Chinese
   ecosystem water use efficiency},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {157},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {How have plants addressed the trade-off between carbon gain and water
   loss in this warming world? Ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE),
   defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to
   evapotranspiration (ET), is a key indicator of the carbon-water
   relationship. WUE is expected to change due to climate change, yet the
   extent to which GPP or ET affects WUE changes remains unclear. Moreover,
   the potential time-varying variations in the WUE responses to recent
   warming have been overlooked. In this study, we assessed the relative
   contributions of GPP and ET to WUE using variance decomposition and
   investigated trends in temperature controls on WUE using moving windows
   and partial correlation analysis. Our results include: (1) the national
   multi-year average WUE in China increased significantly at a rate of
   0.0174 gC<middle dot>kg(-1)H(2)O<middle dot>a(-1), with 86.88\% of the
   study area exhibiting increased trends. Forest ecosystems, except for
   ENF, had relatively higher WUE, and the highest value was observed in
   the deciduous broad-leaf forest (3.77 gC<middle dot>kg(-1)H(2)O), while
   grassland ecosystems had the lowest WUE of only 1.05 gC<middle
   dot>kg(-1)H(2)O. (2) GPP, rather than ET, primary drove WUE variations
   in most areas, except in Northeast China and Southwest China. GPP always
   contributed more to WUE than ET in each land cover type. In forests, ET
   contributed more to WUE than in other land cover types. (3) WUE
   exhibited significantly positive correlations with temperature and
   radiation, with a positive correlation with temperature in 63.73\%
   (14.83\% significant in level of p < 0.05 and the same as below) of the
   study area and positive correlation with radiation in 74.12\% (20.71\%
   significant) of the study area. The control of precipitation on the WUE
   was complex, with a positive correlation with precipitation in 54.29\%
   of the study area (9.38\% significant). (4) The correlation coefficients
   with temperature exhibited an increasing trend in 52.26\% of the study
   areas and a decreasing trend in 47.74\% of the study areas, with a
   notable divergence in the spatial distribution of the trend of the
   temperature controls on WUE. Warming is projected to enhance ecosystem
   functioning in northern regions but may have adverse effects in the
   south. These findings shed light on the dynamic response of ecosystem
   functioning to ongoing warming, and would improve our understanding of
   the terrestrial carbon-water cycle.},

Title = {Temperature and salinity trends in the northern limit of the Canary
   Current Upwelling System},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {901},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Thermohaline time series are crucial for detecting and quantifying
   abiotic changes in the marine environment, and even more so in the
   present global change scenario. This is particularly relevant for the
   Ria the Vigo and its adjacent shelf, a highly productive ecosystem at
   the northern limit of the Canary Current Upwelling System (CanCUS). This
   study analyses a 34-year time series (1987-2020) of
   Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) casts, the longest series available
   to date in the region. Long-term trends, shifts, and seasonal
   variability of temperature and salinity were assessed and investigated
   in relation to regional meteorological variability and basin-scale
   atmospheric teleconnection indices. Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
   allowed us to determine that monthly thermohaline variability can be
   largely explained by regional meteo-climatic variability, mainly
   upwelling index and river discharge. Trends and shifts in some
   teleconnection patterns, especially the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, may
   also be related to both the shift in salinity in 2013 and its long-term
   decrease below 50 m depth. Despite the current global warming context,
   no statistically significant trend was observed for either the upwelling
   index or temperature. The spatial analysis of sea surface temperature
   trends suggests that our study area has been responding to climate
   change differently from other surrounding near-shore areas, as the
   Finisterre Cape or the southern Bay of Biscay. Overall, this study
   highlights the importance of long-term observations to elucidate the
   impact of climate change in the northern limit of the CanCUS and
   encourages caution when extrapolating conclusions from ecosystem studies
   on a regional scale.},

Title = {Sea Surface Temperature Characteristics and Trends in China Offshore

Abstract = {This paper examines the spatial distribution and temporal variability of
   sea surface temperature (SST) in marginal seas off China at seasonal and
   inter-annual scales based on long-term high spatial-resolution optimum
   interpolation sea surface temperature (OISST) data from 1982-2017. Based
   on these data, annual mean SST ranges from 12 degrees C to 30 degrees C.
   Annual mean SST for the entire China offshore region is 25.03 degrees C;
   12.75 degrees C for the Bohai Sea (BHS), 15.31 degrees C for the Yellow
   Sea (YS), 23.70 degrees C for the East China Sea (ECS), and 27.62
   degrees C for the South China Sea (SCS). From south to north, SST
   exhibits a slow decrease with increasing latitude followed by a rapid
   decrease. Latitudinal SST gradients increase from south to north and are
   smallest in the SCS, followed by the ECS, and the YS and BHS. Over the
   past 36 years, annual mean SST has increased at a rate of approximately
   0.0181 degrees C/yr and different marginal seas exhibit different
   features and inter-annual changes. Overall, the China offshore region
   exhibited long-term warming over the past 36 years. The strongest center
   of warming, which exceeds 0.04 degrees C/yr, is located in the ECS near
   the Yangtze River estuary and the Taiwan Strait. Variations in SST in
   the China offshore region are related to global natural climate
   variability and changes in the East Asian Monsoon.},

Title = {Analyzing land surface temperature trends using non-parametric approach:
   A case of Delhi, India},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {19-25},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) creates backwash effect in the system. The
   existing studies consider averaging of Land Surface Temperature (LST)
   over the area of a land-use/land-cover for analysis of UHI, whereas it
   is not necessary that all pixels observe similar behavior. Besides this,
   averaging of LST over space obstructs the spatial continuity. The
   analysis of the behavior of LST over a pixel is important. The
   pixel-wise temperature trend analysis will further open up the layers of
   intensities in a particular land-use/land-cover, and is more meaningful.
   The LST images have been used for trend analysis in different studies
   but the robustness has never been analyzed. In this research, the
   robustness of the LST trend is analyzed pixel-wise by using
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall to detect trends in monthly LST, and
   Theil-Sen slope estimator for analyzing the extent of significance of
   this trend in Delhi. MODIS data from 2001 to 2015 has been used. The
   results highlighted a mix of positive and negative trends in monthly
   LST. February (nighttime) and September (daytime) trends are most
   important due to high robustness at all significance levels. This
   research concludes that there is a positive temperature trend throughout
   the study period especially in night time in Delhi.},

Title = {Zonally asymmetric component of summer surface temperature trends caused
   by intraseasonal time-scale processes},
Journal = {NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed extreme heatwaves in Europe and western
   North America. This study shows that these regions stand out in the
   zonally asymmetric component of the long-term trend of boreal summer
   surface temperature, and that intraseasonal timescale processes play an
   important role in shaping the zonally asymmetric trend pattern. However,
   these two regions have warmed by different mechanisms. Over Europe, the
   warming is mostly caused by the positive trend of the net (downward
   minus upward) surface shortwave radiation weighted by its intraseasonal
   timescale connection with the skin temperature. The long-term warming in
   western North America has been caused by the declining surface latent
   heat flux (weakened evaporative cooling) weighted by its intraseasonal
   connection with the skin temperature. These mechanisms are consistent
   with those identified in earlier studies of individual extreme events in
   the two regions, indicating that part of the long trends are a
   manifestation of extreme events. The overall findings indicate that to
   make accurate projections of regional climate change using climate model
   simulations, it is critical to ensure that the models also accurately
   simulate intraseasonal variability.},

Abstract = {The rise in the frequency and magnitude of extreme temperature phenomena
   across the globe has led to the recurrent incidence of global climate
   hazards, which have had severe effects on socioeconomic development. The
   daily maximum and minimum temperature datasets of 27 sites in Bangladesh
   were used to detect spatiotemporal trends of temperature extremes over
   Bangladesh during 1980-2017 based on ten temperature extreme indices
   using multi-statistical modeling namely linear regression, Pearson
   correlation coefficient, and factor analyses. Besides, mutation analyses
   based on the Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, and Pettit test
   were employed to show the changing trend in extreme temperature. Results
   show that except for warmest days, the warm indices showed an increasing
   trend, mainly since the 2000s, while the growth rate was faster, and the
   response to global climate warming was sensitive. The cold indices were
   demonstrated a reverse trend since the 2010s. Diurnal temperature range
   (DTR) and summer days (SU) increased faster, implying that the rising
   speed of daily max temperature was higher than of daily min-temperature
   in Bangladesh. The de-trended fluctuation analysis (DFA) revealed a
   continuous increase in temperature extreme in the future except for cold
   days. The probability distribution functions (PDF) analysis revealed an
   evident variation of the curves in recent decades compared to the past
   three decades. Besides the warm night, DTR and SU primarily control the
   general warming trend of temperature extremes over Bangladesh during the
   study period. The mutation of the warm indices occurred before the cold
   index, indicating that the warm indices were more sensitive to global
   climate warming. The temperature extremes recognized in our research
   suggest that elevated warm temperature extremes due to global climate
   warming may have huge implications on the sustainable development of
   Bangladesh in the forthcoming period.},

Abstract = {Satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) has been used as one of
   the major parameters in various climate and environmental models.
   Especially, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST is
   the most widely used satellite-based LST product due to its
   spatiotemporal coverage (1 km spatial and sub-daily temporal
   resolutions) and longevity (> 20 years). However, there is an increasing
   demand for LST products with finer spatial resolution (e.g., 10-250 m)
   over regions such as urban areas. Therefore, various methods have been
   proposed to produce high-resolution MODIS-like LST less than 250 m
   (e.g., 100 m). The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive
   overview of recent research trends and challenges for the downscaling of
   MODIS LST. Based on the recent literature survey for the past decade,
   the downscaling techniques classified into three groups-kernel-driven,
   fusion-based, and the combination of kernel-driven and fusion-based
   methods-were reviewed with their pros and cons. Then, five open issues
   and challenges were discussed: uncertainty in LST retrievals, low
   thermal contrast, the nonlinearity of LST temporal change, cloud
   contamination, and model generalization. Future research directions of
   LST downscaling were finally provided.},

   Schottky diode temperature sensors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {This report is on the diameter dependent thermal sensitivity variation
   trend of Ni/4H-nSiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) temperature sensors.
   Scaled SBDs of 2, 1.6, and 1.2mm in diameter were fabricated using
   standard photolithography process comprising a field plate and a guard
   ring as edge terminations on the same epitaxial wafer. Taking into
   consideration the heat loss and power consumption, the thermal
   sensitivities of the fabricated SBDs were measured in the current range
   from 1 mu A to 50 pA. The temperature was varied from 273 to 473K in
   step of 25 K. An authoritative consequence of the present study is the
   observed increase in thermal sensitivity with the diameter of the
   fabricated SBDs. An exhaustive investigation confirms that in all
   diodes, there exist nanosized patches, which assumed to have different
   barrier heights and hence ascertained to be the main cause of anomalies
   in thermal sensitivity variation with diode size. Taking into account
   the effective area of these patches, theoretically fitted I-V curves to
   experimental data show that the numbers of patches were higher in diode
   with least size and decrease with the increase in the size of the diode.
   The corresponding barrier heights of these patches were found to be
   distributed in a Gaussian like manner at the fabricated Ni/4H-nSiC
   interface with least standard deviation (sigma(0)) in the diode of
   maximum size. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.},

Abstract = {Over the past decades surface warming in the southern subtropical Indian
   Ocean (IO) has been greater than that in other oceans. The warming
   penetrates to a depth of 800 m, in contrast to the off-equatorial
   surface warming which coexists with subsurface cooling. We examine the
   dynamics for this rich structure. Results from the 20th century
   experiments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   confirm that the southern subtropical IO surface-to-800 m warming is
   greater than that in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Outputs from two
   targeted ensemble sets of coupled model experiments, one with and one
   without increasing anthropogenic aerosols, show that increasing aerosols
   strengthen the global Conveyor, and generate a greater poleward shift
   and intensification of the Agulhas outflow and its retroflection; the
   process increases the warming rate in the subtropics, and takes heat out
   of the off-equatorial region generating a cooling.},

Abstract = {Arctic atmospheric variability during the industrial era ( 1875 - 2000)
   is assessed using spatially averaged surface air temperature ( SAT) and
   sea level pressure (SLP) records. Air temperature and pressure display
   strong multidecadal variability on timescales of 50 - 80 yr {[} termed
   low-frequency oscillation (LFO)]. Associated with this variability, the
   Arctic SAT record shows two maxima: in the 1930s - 40s and in recent
   decades, with two colder periods in between. In contrast to the global
   and hemispheric temperature, the maritime Arctic temperature was higher
   in the late 1930s through the early 1940s than in the 1990s. Incomplete
   sampling of large-amplitude multidecadal fluctuations results in
   oscillatory Arctic SAT trends. For example, the Arctic SAT trend since
   1875 is 0.09 +/- 0.03degreesC decade(-1), with stronger spring- and
   wintertime warming; during the twentieth century ( when positive and
   negative phases of the LFO nearly offset each other) the Arctic
   temperature increase is 0.05 +/- 0.04degreesC decade(-1), similar to the
   Northern Hemispheric trend ( 0.06degreesC decade(-1)). Thus, the
   large-amplitude multidecadal climate variability impacting the maritime
   Arctic may confound the detection of the true underlying climate trend
   over the past century. LFO-modulated trends for short records are not
   indicative of the long-term behavior of the Arctic climate system. The
   accelerated warming and a shift of the atmospheric pressure pattern from
   anticyclonic to cyclonic in recent decades can be attributed to a
   positive LFO phase. It is speculated that this LFO-driven shift was
   crucial to the recent reduction in Arctic ice cover. Joint examination
   of air temperature and pressure records suggests that peaks in
   temperature associated with the LFO follow pressure minima after 5 - 15
   yr. Elucidating the mechanisms behind this relationship will be critical
   to understanding the complex nature of low-frequency variability.},

Abstract = {Extreme temperature is the key indicator of extreme climatic events. The
   goal of this research was to better understand the long-term trends and
   shifting behaviors associated with Bangladesh's record-breaking high
   temperatures in the country's atmosphere. Data from 26 Bangladeshi
   meteorological stations collected between 1981 and 2018 was analyzed
   with RClimDex. The annual count of warm (cold) spell duration increased,
   according to the findings (decrease). In the coastal regions, this
   rising temperature trend is more pronounced. There were longer (shorter)
   periods of warm (cold) weather in the twentieth century than there were
   in the previous decade. As a result, the length of warm (cold) spells
   has become longer since the beginning of the twenty-first century, as
   compared to the last quarter of the twentieth century. There is little
   fluctuation in diurnal temperatures, but they are getting smaller and
   smaller. There is a 13\% decrease in the Cold Spell Duration Indicator
   (CSDI), which indicates that we are in for a long, cold winter. At a
   rate of 14\% per year, the Warm Spell Duration Indicator (WSDI) annual
   count suggests an extremely hot summer is imminent. Diurnal temperature
   range (DTR) values decreased by 1.1\% year-round, raising the specter of
   climate extremes like the CSDI and WSD. An increasing (decreasing) trend
   in indicators of how long hot (cold) weather lasts indicates an increase
   (decrease) in Bangladesh's warm atmosphere. As a result, an increase in
   the number of extreme weather events, particularly along the coasts,
   should be expected across the country.},

Abstract = {The paper discusses the present trends in the design of low-noise
   front-end systems for room temperature semiconductor detectors. The
   technological advancement provided by submicron CMOS processes is
   examined from several points of view. The noise performances are a
   fundamental issue in most detector applications and suitable attention
   is devoted to them for the purpose of judging whether or not the present
   processes supersede the solutions featuring a field-effect transistor as
   a front-end element. However, other considerations are also important in
   judging how well a monolithic technology suits the front-end design.
   Among them, the way a technology lends itself to the realization of
   additional functions, for instance, the charge reset in a
   charge-sensitive loop or the time-variant filters featuring the special
   weighting functions that may he requested in some applications of CdTe
   or CZT detectors.},

Title = {Positive Trend in the Antarctic Sea Ice Cover and Associated Changes in
   Surface Temperature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2251-2267},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Antarctic sea ice extent has been slowly increasing contrary to
   expected trends due to global warming and results from coupled climate
   models. After a record high extent in 2012 the extent was even higher in
   2014 when the magnitude exceeded 20 x 10(6) km(2) for the first time
   during the satellite era. The positive trend is confirmed with newly
   reprocessed sea ice data that addressed inconsistency issues in the time
   series. The variability in sea ice extent and ice area was studied
   alongside surface ice temperature for the 34-yr period starting in 1981,
   and the results of the analysis show a strong correlation of -0.94
   during the growth season and -0.86 during the melt season. The
   correlation coefficients are even stronger with a one-month lag in
   surface temperature at -0.96 during the growth season and -0.98 during
   the melt season, suggesting that the trend in sea ice cover is strongly
   influenced by the trend in surface temperature. The correlation with
   atmospheric circulation as represented by the southern annular mode
   (SAM) index appears to be relatively weak. A case study comparing the
   record high in 2014 with a relatively low ice extent in 2015 also shows
   strong sensitivity to changes in surface temperature. The results
   suggest that the positive trend is a consequence of the spatial
   variability of global trends in surface temperature and that the ability
   of current climate models to forecast sea ice trend can be improved
   through better performance in reproducing observed surface temperatures
   in the Antarctic region.},

   temperature (SAT) variability and trends in the Arctic are needed. Here
   we present an analysis of Arctic SAT variability in comparison with
   mid-latitudes and the Northern Hemisphere (NH), based on an advanced SAT
   dataset - NansenSAT. We define an index for the Arctic amplification as
   the ratio between absolute values of the Arctic (65-90 degrees N) and NH
   30-yr running linear SAT trends. It is demonstrated that the temperature
   amplification in the Arctic is characteristic not only for the recent
   warming but also the early 20th century warming (ETCW) and subsequent
   cooling. The amplification appears to be weaker during the recent
   warming than in the ETCW, simply because the index values reflect the
   more pervasive nature of the recent warming that reflects the background
   of anthropogenic global warming. We also produced a new Arctic
   regionalisation created from hierarchical cluster analysis, which
   identifies six major natural regions in the Arctic that reflect SAT
   variability. Statistical comparison with several climate indices shows
   that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is the mode of
   variability that is most significantly associated with the amplified
   warming-cooling in the Arctic, with a stronger correlation during the
   ETCW and recent warming than during the intermediate period. Regionally,
   differences are identified in terms of annual and seasonal rates of
   change and in their correlations with modes of variability.},

Title = {Impact of ENSO and Trends on the Distribution of North American
   Wintertime Daily Temperature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {The effect of the El Ni \& ntilde;o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   teleconnection and climate change trends on observed North American
   wintertime daily 2-m temperature is investigated for 1960 - 2022 with a
   quantile regression model, which represents the variability of the full
   distribution of daily temperature, including extremes and changes in
   spread. Climate change trends are included as a predictor in the
   regression model to avoid the potentially confounding effect on ENSO
   teleconnections. Based on prior evidence of asymmetric impacts from El
   Ni \& ntilde;o and La Ni \& ntilde;a, the ENSO response is taken to be
   piecewise linear, and the regression model contains separate predictors
   for warm and cool ENSO. The relationship between these predictors and
   shifts in median, interquartile range, skewness, and kurtosis of daily
   2-m temperature are summarized through Legendre polynomials. Warm ENSO
   conditions result in signi fi cant warming shifts in the median and
   contraction of the interquartile range in central -northern North
   America, while no opposite effect is found for cool ENSO conditions in
   this region. In the southern United States, cool ENSO conditions produce
   a warming shift in the median, while warm ENSO conditions have little
   impact on the median, but contracts the interquartile range. Climate
   change trends are present as a near -uniform warming in the median and
   across quantiles and have no discernable impact on interquartile range
   or higher -order moments. Trends and ENSO together explain a substantial
   fraction of the interannual variability of daily temperature
   distribution shifts across much of North America and, to a lesser
   extent, changes of the interquartile range.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the trends in extreme high temperature in Southwest
   China based on the observed daily maximum temperature and average
   temperature data from 410 Chinese stations recently released by the
   China Meteorological Administration. The authors found that the trends
   in extreme high temperature at different altitudes of Southwest China
   exhibit staged variations during a recent 50-year period (1961-2014).
   The trends in mean temperature and maximum temperature also exhibit
   phase variation. All temperature-related variables increase gently
   during the period 1975-94, whereas they increase dramatically during the
   recent period of 1995-2014, with a rate that is approximately two to ten
   times more than that during 1975-94. In addition, the trends in mean
   temperature, maximum temperature, and the frequency of extreme high
   temperature in the low altitudes transit from negative to positive in
   the two periods, while they increase dramatically in the mid- and
   high-altitude areas during 1995-2014, the well-known global warming
   hiatus period. In particular, the maximum temperature increases much
   faster than that of average temperature. This result implies that the
   regional temperature trend could be apparently different from the global
   mean temperature change.},

Title = {Recent temperature trends at mountain stations on the southern slope of

Volume = {122},
Number = {1},
Pages = {215-227},

Abstract = {Insufficient long-term in situ observations and complex topographic
   conditions pose major problems in quantifying the magnitude of climatic
   trends in mountainous regions such as Nepal. Presented here is three
   decades (1980-2009) of data on annual maximum, minimum and average
   temperature trends from 13 mountain stations on the southern slope of
   the central Himalayas. The stations are located at elevations between
   1304 and 2566 m above sea level and with varied topography. Spatial
   analyses of the average temperature trend show warming in most of the
   stations. The magnitude of warming is higher for maximum temperatures,
   while minimum temperatures exhibit larger variability such as positive,
   negative or no change. These results are consistent with patterns
   reported in some parts of the Indian subcontinent and Upper Indus Basin,
   but different from conditions on the Tibetan Plateau (China), where the
   warming of minimum temperatures is more prominent than that of the
   maximum temperatures. From the temporal variations, a dramatic increase
   in temperature is observed in the latest decade, particularly in the
   average and maximum temperatures. The results from the cumulative sum
   chart analyses suggest that the thermal regime shifted in 1997. The
   dramatic enhancement of average temperature in the last decade is
   strongly consistent with the result of contemporary studies of the
   surrounding regions, where warming is attributed to an increase in
   anthropogenic greenhouse gases. However, as in the western Himalayas and
   the Upper Indus Basin, the mountain stations on the southern slope of
   the central Himalayas show variability in temperature trends,
   particularly for the minimum temperature. This inhomogeneous trend is
   likely ascribed to the differences in topography and microclimatic
   regime of the observed stations.},

Abstract = {Controversy continues to prevail concerning the reality of
   anthropogenically-induced climatic warming. One of the principal issues
   is the cause of the hiatus in the current global warming trend. There
   appears to be a widely held view that climatic change warming should
   exhibit an inexorable upwards trend, a view that implies there is no
   longer any input by climatic variability in the existing climatic
   system. The relative roles of climatic change and climatic variability
   are examined here using the same coupled global climatic model. For the
   former, the model is run using a specified CO2 growth scenario, while
   the latter consisted of a multi-millennial simulation where any climatic
   variability was attributable solely to internal processes within the
   climatic system. It is shown that internal climatic variability can
   produce global mean surface temperature anomalies of +/- 0.25 K and
   sustained positive and negative anomalies sufficient to account for the
   anomalous warming of the 1940s as well as the present hiatus in the
   observed global warming. The characteristics of the internally-induced
   negative temperature anomalies are such that if this internal natural
   variability is the cause of the observed hiatus, then a resumption of
   the observed global warming trend is to be expected within the next few
   years.},

Title = {Evidence for influence of anthropogenic surface processes on lower

Volume = {26},
Number = {7},
Pages = {897-913},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {In de Laat and Maurellis (2004), a new framework was introduced in the
   form of a spatial-thresholding trend technique for analyzing the
   correlation between anthropogenic surface processes (e.g. changes in
   land use, albedo, soil moisture, groundwater levels, solar absorption by
   soot or energy consumption) and lower tropospheric and surface
   temperature trends for the period 1979-2001. In situ measured surface
   and satellite-measured lower tropospheric temperature trends were shown
   to be higher in the vicinity of industrialized regions, while such
   higher trends were not found in enhanced greenhouse gas (GHG) climate
   model simulations of temperature. It was suggested that surface and
   lower tropospheric temperature trends appeared to be influenced by
   anthropogenic non-GHG processes on the earth's surface.
   In this paper, we verify the robustness of the thresholding technique
   and confirm our earlier conclusions on the basis of an extended analysis
   and two additional data sets. We confirm the presence of a temperature
   change-industrialization correlation by analyzing the data with an
   additional statistical method and further confirm the absence of the
   above correlation in climate model simulations of enhanced GHG warming.
   Our findings thus provide an important test of climate model performance
   on regional scales.
   These findings suggest that over the last two decades non-GHG
   anthropogenic processes have also contributed significantly to surface
   temperature changes. We identify one process that potentially could
   contribute to the observed temperature patterns, although there
   certainly may be other processes involved. Copyright (c) 2006 Royal

Abstract = {As part of the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN), we have
   measured gas-phase polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in the
   atmosphere around the Great Lakes since November of 1990. In this paper,
   we use these data to explore the temperature and time dependencies of
   gas-phase PCB concentrations near Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Erie and
   in Chicago. Concentrations of individual PCB congeners were well
   correlated to temperature for the three remote sites using the
   Clausius-Clapeyron equation, but the calculated heats of surface-air
   exchange did not correlate (on a congener basis) with
   laboratory-measured heats of vaporization. On the other hand, the heats
   of surface-air exchange for PCB congeners measured in Chicago are well
   correlated with laboratory-measured heats of vaporization. We conclude
   that the gas-phase PCB concentrations measured at Chicago are controlled
   by short-range transport, but at the three remote sites, these
   concentrations are controlled by long-range transport. Gasphase PCBs
   also exhibited decreasing concentrations over the period 1991-1997 near
   Lakes Michigan and Erie and in Chicago. Significant half-lives ranged
   from 0.5 to 7.5 years for individual congeners and 2.8 to 3.3 years for
   total PCBs. Gas-phase PCBs near Lake Superior showed no general trend in
   gas-phase concentration over this same time period.},

Abstract = {In the context of climate changes, detailed information concerning the
   response of different components of the environment to the observed
   situation is of high importance. Due to strong correlations of air and
   water temperatures, water ecosystems have been subject to a considerable
   transformation for several decades. The paper presents the analysis of
   long-term (1960-2009) water temperature fluctuations in the Warta River,
   third longest river in Poland. Based on six stations located along the
   bank of the Warta River, its thermal parameters and tendencies and rate
   of changes were determined. Moreover, based on data concerning air
   temperature, correlations between those two media were analysed. Water
   temperature in the Warta River over the last fifty years was
   characterised by low variability, ranging in the analysed stations from
   9.5 degrees C in Sieradz to 10.3 degrees C in Poznan and Skwierzyna. The
   Mann-Kendall trend tests, Sen's slope estimator and the Pettitt test
   were applied to long-term time series of air and water temperature
   analysis. Long-term fluctuations of mean annual water temperatures were
   characterised by an increase (statistically significant, depending on
   the station at a level of p=0.05 and p=0.001) from 0.096 to 0.281
   degrees C.dec-1. Water temperature in the case of the analysed stations
   appears to be particularly determined by climatic factors, as suggested
   by very strong correlations with air temperature (from 0.82 to 0.94).
   Evident changes in the thermal regime of the Warta River in the context
   of functioning of the entire ecosystem should be considered
   unfavourable. The observed as well as future increase in water
   temperature will modify current processes occurring in the river,
   referring to among others water quality, composition of ichthyofauna, or
   hydrological conditions. Further temperature changes should be
   mitigated, by among others appropriate management of the riverbank zone
   (planting trees) and by increasing the share of forest areas in the
   catchment. (C) 2019 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the

Abstract = {Trends in monthly average, zonal average temperature in the stratosphere
   as retrieved from highly accurate modern satellite data are
   intercompared and compared with climate reanalyses from 2003 through
   2014. The data sets used are those of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and
   Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation, and the reanalyses
   are those of MERRA and ERA-Interim. Trends produced by all data sets
   agree to within 0.02 K/year in the lower stratosphere and 0.05 K/year in
   the middle stratosphere. A number of retrieval errors are found that
   introduce incorrect trends and seasonal anomalies. Adding microwave data
   to the infrared retrieval changes trends by approximately 0.01 K/year,
   thus improving agreement with the other data sets. The signature of the
   quasi-biennial oscillation in temperature and the annual cycle of
   temperature over Antarctica as retrieved from infrared data contain
   null-space errors of more than 3 K due to erroneous priors used in
   retrieval. Nonuniformity in GPS radio occultation gives rise to errors
   because changes in received GPS signal strength alter the upper boundary
   initialization in radio occultation retrieval. Finally, an incorrect
   specification of atmospheric water vapor introduces an erroneous
   seasonal cycle of temperature as retrieved from GPS radio occultation
   data in the upper troposphere. All of these time-dependent retrieval
   errors can be corrected with future research and improvements to
   spectral infrared and GPS radio occultation retrieval systems.},

Title = {Long term climatic trends in chile and effects on soli moisture and
   temperature regimes},
Journal = {CHILEAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {76},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Climate change could potentially affect agricultural and forest
   production in Chile through changes in soil moisture and temperature
   regimes. In Soil Taxonomy the Soil Moisture Regime (SMR) is used to
   classify soils at the Suborder, Great Group and Subgroup levels, whereas
   Soil Temperature Regime (STR) is mainly used at the Family level. Both
   SMR and STR can be calculated using climatic data input to the Newhall
   model. Therefore, the objective of this research was to test the
   hypothesis that long term climate change has already affected the SMR
   and STR in different locations of the country. Historical values
   (1912-2015) of monthly precipitation and temperature were input to the
   model, with the available soil water set to 180 mm, and the offset of
   air to soil temperature set to 2 degrees C. The climatic records
   indicated a general trend of less precipitation in central and south
   central Chile whereby the SMR changed in Concepcion from UsticUdic
   Tropustic to Ustic-Typic Tropustic; in Puerto Montt from Perudic to
   Udic-Typic Udic; and in Punta Arenas from Aridic-Typic Aridic to
   Xeric-Typic Xeric. In general, the recent period had more frequent
   extreme dry years. There was also a general tendency for slightly cooler
   temperatures mainly along the coast, and warming in Santiago, but the
   dominant STRs did not change between periods. Additionally, in south
   central Chile there was a decrease of annual moist days when the soil
   temperature is >= 5 degrees C, which suggests that in some areas soil
   temperature and moisture conditions have become somewhat more limiting
   over time, and, if continued, will likely result in a southerly
   expansion of the Xeric SMR, and increased need for supplemental
   irrigation of crops.},

Title = {Temporal homogenization of monthly radiosonde temperature data. Part II:
   Trends, sensitivities, and MSU comparison},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Trends in radiosonde-based temperatures and lower-tropospheric lapse
   rates are presented for the time periods 1959-97 and 1979-97, including
   their vertical, horizontal, and seasonal variations. A novel aspect is
   that estimates are made globally of the effects of artificial
   (instrumental or procedural) changes on the derived trends using data
   homogenization procedures introduced in a companion paper (Part I).
   Credibility of the data homogenization scheme is established by
   comparison with independent satellite temperature measurements derived
   from the microwave sounding unit (MSU) instruments for 1979-97. The
   various analyses are performed using monthly mean temperatures from a
   near-globally distributed network of 87 radiosonde stations.
   The severity of instrument-related problems, which varies markedly by
   geographic region, was found, in general, to increase from the lower
   troposphere to the lower stratosphere, although surface data were found
   to be as problematic as data from the stratosphere. Except for the
   surface, there is a tendency for changes in instruments to artificially
   lower temperature readings with time, so that adjusting the data to
   account for this results in increased tropospheric warming and decreased
   stratospheric cooling. Furthermore, the adjustments tend to enhance
   warming in the upper troposphere more than in the lower troposphere;
   such sensitivity may have implications for ``fingerprint'' assessments
   of climate change. However, the most sensitive part of the vertical
   profile with regard to its shape was near the surface, particularly at
   regional scales. In particular, the lower-tropospheric lapse rate was
   found to be especially sensitive to adjustment as well as spatial
   sampling. In the lower stratosphere, instrument-related biases were
   found to artificially inflate latitudinal differences, leading to
   statistically significantly more cooling in the Tropics than elsewhere.
   After adjustment there were no significant differences between the
   latitude zones.},

Abstract = {Increasing concerns exist about possible decreased wintering duck
   abundance and hunting opportunities in the southern regions of the
   Atlantic and Mississippi flyways of North America. Researchers suggest
   these decreased abundances of ducks may be related to winter warming and
   related climatic phenomena. Accordingly, we tested predictions that duck
   abundance was increasing more at northern than southern latitudes, and
   that trends were related to average winter temperatures (Dec-Jan). We
   tested predictions using National Audubon Society Christmas Bird Count
   (CBC) data collected during December 1969 through January 2019 from 31
   states in the United States and 6 Canadian provinces that comprise the
   Atlantic and Mississippi flyways for 16 species of dabbling and diving
   ducks (Anatinae). We found support for the prediction that CBC trends in
   duck abundance vary with latitude, and mean winter temperature explained
   nearly half the variation in CBC trends for 12 of 16 species. For some
   species, trends were negative in warmer regions and positive in colder
   regions. For others, trends were stable or slightly positive in warmer
   regions but more positive in colder regions. These results provide
   empirical evidence supporting climate-influenced winter range changes by
   important game duck species and suggest challenges and opportunities for
   waterfowl population, habitat, and hunting management in North America
   and the northern hemisphere. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.},

Abstract = {de Freitas et al. (2015) (henceforth dFDB) report a trend of 0.28 A
   degrees C per century over the period 1909-2009 for New Zealand land
   surface temperatures, from their reanalysis of a composite of seven
   long-term records. This is much lower than the warming trend of about
   0.9 A degrees C per century reported previously by other researchers and
   much smaller than trends estimated from independent sea surface
   temperature data from the surrounding region. We show these differences
   result primarily from the way inhomogeneities in temperature time series
   at individual stations due to site or instrument changes are identified
   and adjusted for in the dFDB paper. The adjustments reported in that
   paper are based on a method designed by one of us (Salinger), but use
   only a short (1-2-year) overlap period with comparison stations and
   consider only inhomogeneities in monthly mean (rather than monthly
   maximum and minimum) temperatures. This leads to underestimates of the
   statistical significance of individual temperature discontinuities and
   hence rejection of many valid adjustments. Since there was a systematic
   tendency for the seven-station sites to be relocated to colder locations
   as the early half of the twentieth century progressed, this rejection of
   valid adjustments produces an artificially low rate of warming. We
   therefore disagree with the trend calculations in the dFDB paper and
   consider there is no reason to reject the previous estimates of around
   0.9 A degrees C warming per century.},

Title = {Recent trend in temperature evolution in Spanish mainland (1951-2010):
   from warming to hiatus},

Abstract = {The most recent debate on global warming focuses on the hiatus in global
   temperature, for which several explanations have been proposed. On the
   other hand, spatial variability and nonlinearity in temperature
   evolution has been recognized as a key point in global change analyses.
   In this study, we analyse the evolution of the warming rate in the
   Spanish mainland using the MOTEDAS data set for the last 60 years
   (1951-2010). Our special emphasis is on the last decades to detect and
   identify a possible hiatus, and to determine the effects of daytime
   (T-max) and night-time (T-min) records at annual and seasonal scale on
   the hiatus. Moving windows running trend analyses were applied to
   calculate temperature trend and significance for any temporal window
   from the beginning to the end of the series, ranging from 20 years to
   the whole series length (60 years)
   The results suggest that the warming rate in the Spanish mainland
   reached a maximum between 1970 and 1990, followed by a decrease in
   intensity in both T-max and T-min until the present. Furthermore, the
   decrease in the warming rate in T-max has been higher than in T-min for
   the last three decades; therefore, recent annual warming rates appears
   to depend more on T-min than on T-max. Significant trends disappear from
   the middle of the 1980s at any temporal window length in both T-max and
   T-min at annual and seasonal scales except in spring T-min.
   Some differences among seasons are evident and, during the last few
   decades, the highest rates of warming are found in spring and summer,
   with T-max and T-min behaving in different ways. This study highlights
   how the warming rate is highly dependent on the length of the period
   analysed.},

Abstract = {This study presents a second generation of homogenized monthly mean
   surface air temperature data set for Canadian climate trend analysis.
   Monthly means of daily maximum and of daily minimum temperatures were
   examined at 338 Canadian locations. Data from co-located observing sites
   were sometimes combined to create longer time series for use in trend
   analysis. Time series of observations were then adjusted to account for
   nation-wide change in observing time in July 1961, affecting daily
   minimum temperatures recorded at 120 synoptic stations; these were
   adjusted using hourly temperatures at the same sites. Next, homogeneity
   testing was performed to detect and adjust for other discontinuities.
   Two techniques were used to detect non-climatic shifts in
   de-seasonalized monthly mean temperatures: a multiple linear regression
   based test and a penalized maximal t test. These discontinuities were
   adjusted using a recently developed quantile-matching algorithm: the
   adjustments were estimated with the use of a reference series. Based on
   this new homogenized temperature data set, annual and seasonal
   temperature trends were estimated for Canada for 1950-2010 and Southern
   Canada for 1900-2010. Overall, temperature has increased at most
   locations. For 1950-2010, the annual mean temperature averaged over the
   country shows a positive trend of 1.5 degrees C for the past 61 years.
   This warming is slightly more pronounced in the minimum temperature than
   in the maximum temperature; seasonally, the greatest warming occurs in
   winter and spring. The results are similar for Southern Canada although
   the warming is considerably greater in the minimum temperature compared
   to the maximum temperature over the period 1900-2010.},

Abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on
   the Terra and Aqua satellites have been operating since 2000 and 2002,
   respectively. To date both instruments have demonstrated good
   calibration stability for the Thermal Emissive Bands (TEB). Maintaining
   calibration accuracy is an important issue, as the instrument age, for
   continued production of high quality science data. In this paper a
   strategy to track the stability of MODIS TEB measurements from launch to
   present using a cold ground target is discussed. The land surface in the
   area surrounding Dome Concordia, Antarctica (75.1 S, 123.4 E) is well
   characterized and stable in terms of surface temperature and emissivity.
   A research station at Dome Concordia provides a record of climate
   variables and the opportunities for satellite validation field
   campaigns. Both MODIS instruments overpass the site 7-10 times per day,
   including a near-nadir overpass once every 23 days. The long-term data
   record of near-nadir Dome Concordia MODIS TEB measurements is analyzed
   relative to the measurements of ground-based (Automated Weather Station)
   and other satellite (e.g. Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)) sensors.
   This approach allows for the detection of any long-term calibration
   drift and the calibration consistency between Aqua and Terra MODIS.
   Additionally, a method to correct the observed cold scene bias for Aqua
   MODIS versus AIRS is discussed.},

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {167-177},
Abstract = {In the EU-Project ENSEMBLES, a major objective was the development of a
   weighting system for regional climate models (RCMs) based on the ability
   of the RCMs to reproduce observed characteristics of important
   atmospheric variables. Within this context, a suite of state-of-the-art
   RCMs was employed for the creation of probabilistic future regional
   climate change scenarios for Europe. Among others, one measure to
   determine the individual RCM-weights is their ability to reproduce the
   observed trends in 2 m temperature in the reanalysis (ERA40)-driven
   experiments for the period 1960-2000. As the reference, we used the new
   ENSEMBLES observational gridded dataset for Europe (E-OBS). As
   additional datasets for comparisons, we also used the near-surface
   temperature datasets from the CRU observations and from the ERA40 and
   NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The analysis was performed for the land fraction
   of 8 different European regions, the so-called PRUDENCE regions defined
   within the PRUDENCE project (http://prudence.dmi.dk). Annual and
   seasonal linear trends in near-surface temperature were computed for
   each ENSEMBLES RCM, the E-OBS dataset, and for the additional datasets
   mentioned above. In all regions, the computed linear temperature trends
   based on annual mean temperatures showed smaller values for the RCMs and
   the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis than for both observational datasets, and in
   most regions also smaller values than for the ERA40 reanalysis dataset.
   Depending on the magnitude of the difference in linear trends between
   the individual RCMs and the E-OBS dataset, skill scores were assigned to
   each RCM. The resulting skill scores were of similar magnitude (0.7-0.9)
   for the different models and regions (except for Scandinavia, which had
   lower skill scores around 0.6-0.8). Spatially aggregated for all of
   Europe, and combined from annual and seasonal into one value for each
   RCM, these skill scores were included in the general ENSEMBLES RCM
   weighting system},

Abstract = {Lake temperature has proven to act as a good indicator of climate
   variability and change. Thus, a surface temperature analysis at
   different temporal scales is important, as this parameter influences the
   physical, chemical, and biological cycles of lakes. Here, we analyze
   monthly, seasonal, and annual surface temperature trends in south
   central Chilean lakes during the 2000-2016 period, using MODIS satellite
   imagery. To this end, 14 lakes with a surface area greater than 10 km(2)
   were examined. Results show that 12 of the 14 lakes presented a
   statistically significant increase in surface temperature, with a rate
   of 0.10 degrees C/decade (0.01 degrees C/year) over the period.
   Furthermore, some of the lakes in the study present a significant upward
   trend in surface temperature, especially in spring, summer, and winter.
   In general, a significant increase in surface water temperature was
   found in lakes located at higher altitudes, such as Maule, Laja and
   Galletue lakes. These results contribute to the provision of useful data
   on Chilean lakes for managers and policymakers.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to extend the knowledge about the
   formation and thermal stability of vacancy-type defects in tungsten
   under neutron irradiation, thereby mimicking the temperature and neutron
   flux expected in the ITER divertor. Neutron irradiation of single
   crystal tungsten, W(100), in the temperature range 60 0-1200 degrees C
   is performed up to 0.12 dpa. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is
   employed to detect the presence of open volume defects, while hardness
   tests are applied to relate the irradiation-induced defects with the
   modification of mechanical properties. Rationalization of the
   experimental results is enhanced by the application of a kinetic Monte
   Carlo simulation tool, applied to model the microstructural evolution
   under the neutron irradiation process. The relation between radiation
   microstructure and hardness is explained via a dispersed barrier model.

Abstract = {Global climate change and its consequences on the ecosystems have been
   of big concern by the majority of the world countries. Iraq as part of
   the Middle East is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Most of
   climate change researches in Iraq focused on major cities such as
   Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra. This work aimed at determining the trends of
   temperature and precipitation for the city of Hilla during the past 10
   decades. To accomplish this purpose, high-resolution gridded data
   obtained from the University of Delaware were analysed. The results
   showed that temperature trend was increasing and most warming period
   happened during the past 20 years, especially during summer when monthly
   mean of daily temperature exceeds 35 degrees C. Results of Mann-Kendall
   test no trend exist for the months of January, February, October,
   November, and December. Analysis of precipitation time series indicated
   that highest precipitation over Hilla city occurred during the early
   decades of 1910s and 1920s, that mount gradually declined, and the
   lowest precipitation occurred during the last 20 years when
   precipitation rate was always below the 115 years mean value. Applying
   Mann-Kendall test on the annual precipitation time series showed that
   there is a statistically significant decreasing trend. The significance
   of study is to provide detailed information on the effect of global
   warming on the local climate of Hilla city.},

Abstract = {Long-term trends in the sea surface temperature in the Canary upwelling
   zone and their causes are analyzed on the basis of satellite data from
   the 1980s until the present. It is shown that the wind activity has
   strengthened near the northwestern African coast during last 30 years,
   which is accompanied by local intensification of wind-driven upwelling.
   The northeastern trade wind weakens in the open Tropical Atlantic, along
   with the horizontal heat advection in the upper ocean layer, which leads
   to a decrease in the area of the upwelling waters. As a result, both
   tendencies partly compensate one another when the temperature is
   averaged over the region in the northeastern Tropical Atlantic (between
   10 degrees-30 degrees N, 10 degrees-25 degrees W).},

Title = {Reconciling the Spatial Distribution of the Surface Temperature Trends

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {25},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3610-3618},

Abstract = {This study attempts to explain the considerable spatial heterogeneity in
   the observed linear trends of monthly mean maximum and minimum
   temperatures (T-max and T-min) from station observations in the
   southeastern (SE) United States (specifically Florida, Alabama, Georgia,
   South Carolina, and North Carolina). In a majority of these station
   sites, the warming trends in Tmin are stronger in urban areas relative
   to rural areas. The linear trends of T-min in urban areas of the SE
   United States are approximately 7 degrees F century 21 compared to about
   5.5 degrees F century(-1) in rural areas. The trends in T-max show
   weaker warming (or stronger cooling) trends with irrigation, while
   trends in T-min show stronger warming trends. This functionality of the
   temperature trends with land features also shows seasonality, with the
   boreal summer season showing the most consistent relationship in the
   trends of both T-max and T-min. This study reveals that linear trends in
   T-max in the boreal summer season show a cooling trend of about 0.5
   degrees F century(-1) with irrigation, while the same observing stations
   on an average display warming trends in T-min of about 3.5 degrees F
   century(-1). The seasonality and the physical consistency of these
   relationships with existing theories may suggest that urbanization and
   irrigation have a nonnegligible influence on the spatial heterogeneity
   of the surface temperature trends over the SE United States. The study
   also delineates the caveats and limitations of the conclusions reached
   herein due to the potential influence of perceived nonclimatic
   discontinuities (which incidentally could also have a seasonal cycle)
   that have not been taken into account.},

Title = {Zonally Asymmetric Temperature Trends near the Northern Middle and High

Journal = {JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {441-453},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The temperature trend near the stratopause is rarely evaluated owing to
   the limited long-term observations of global temperature. In this study,
   the spatial patterns of the temperature trends near the northern
   stratopause are investigated by using satellite and reanalysis datasets.
   Our analysis reveals a zonally asymmetric temperature trend pattern near
   the northern mid-to-high latitude stratopause during January, and this
   pattern underwent an evident transition around the 2000s. From 1980 to
   2003, there was a cooling trend in the Western Hemisphere and a warming
   trend in the Eastern Hemisphere. In contrast, a reversed zonally
   asymmetric temperature trend pattern existed in the east-west direction
   from 2003 to 2020. Although the warming trends are statistically
   insignificant, they contrasted with the overall cooling trend in the
   upper stratosphere due to ozone depletion and an increase in well-mixed
   greenhouse gases in recent decades. The zonally asymmetric temperature
   trends were induced by the transition in the intensity of
   quasi-stationary planetary wavenumber 1 (wave 1) near the stratopause.
   The increasing (decreasing) trend of the intensity of wave 1 enhanced
   (weakened) its meridional temperature advection near the stratopause
   before (after) the 2000s; consequently, a zonally asymmetric temperature
   trend pattern exists in the east-west direction near the stratopause.
   The transition in the intensity of the stratospheric wave 1 around the
   2000s is most likely caused by the transition in the intensity of wave 1
   activity in the troposphere.},

Title = {Analysis of recent trends and variability of temperature and relative

Journal = {MAUSAM},

Volume = {73},

Abstract = {The world is experiencing adverse consequences of climate change and
   shifts in climate regimes. Hence, studying the trends and patterns of
   meteorological variables is of major importance for many parties,
   including meteorologists, climatologists, agriculturists and
   hydrologists. Although several researchers have examined the trends and
   patterns in historical rainfall, only a few have examined the trends in
   atmospheric temperature. Noteworthy none of the previous studies have
   attempted to investigate trends in relative humidity over Sri Lanka.
   Therefore, identifying this existing research gap, this present paper
   presents a trends and variability analysis of atmospheric temperature
   and relative humidity of Sri Lanka. The long-term variations of minimum
   and maximum temperature and relative humidity records at 18 stations
   distributed in the three climatic zones namely, the dry zone, the
   intermediate zone and the wet zone in Sri Lanka were investigated for 30
   years from 1990 to 2019. Annual and monthly trends were assessed using
   non-parametric statistical tests, including the Mann Kendall test (MK),
   Sen's slope and Spearman's rho test, while the changing points of
   temperature and humidity were determined using the Pettit test. In
   addition, the variability of climate parameters was estimated using the
   Coefficient of Variation (CoV). Interesting and encouraging results were
   obtained from the present analysis. Badulla in the intermediate climatic
   zone was identified with unexpected decreasing temperature trends, while
   several other areas were identified with expected increasing temperature
   and relative humidity trends. The adaptation practices based on these
   results would be interesting to incorporate in achieving sustainable
   development goals for the country.},

Title = {Impact of of land use and land cover changes on temperature trends over
   India},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {89},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study estimates the temperature trends over India and seeks to
   understand the contribution of land use and land cover (LULC) changes
   towards the change in the temperature trends (warming or cooling) during
   1981 similar to 2006 by using `Observation minus Reanalysis' (OMR)
   method. We find that the India got warmer by 0.1 degrees C per decade
   during 1981-2006 and the LULC changes contributed to cooling over India
   by 0.02 degrees C per decade during this period. The contribution of
   land use changes to the temperature trends depends on the type of LULC
   and their conversion from one type to another. With the exception of
   dense forest, all land cover conversions to agriculture lead to cooling
   whereas conversion from dense forest to agriculture results in warming.
   The contribution of LULC changes towards cooling over India during
   1981-2006 is due to the reduction of area under shrubs/ small vegetation
   and subsequent increase of the area under agricultural/ fallow land. The
   analysis shows that even though the LULC changes contributed towards
   overall cooling during 1981-2006 over India, it contributed towards
   warming during 1991-2006. We find that the cooling caused by LULC
   changes during 1981-2006 is due to the cooling contributed during
   1981-1990. Our overall results have implications for future land use
   change strategies that can be undertaken over India in order to avoid
   further worsening the Indian climate.},

Abstract = {A simple index of extreme surface (2 m) monthly temperature was analyzed
   over the conterminous United States for 13 models from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) hindcast (1981-2010) and
   prediction (2006-35) datasets as well as the U.S. climate division
   dataset, version 2 (nClimDiv), as observations for 1981-2010. Results
   are analyzed for regions defined in the recent Third U.S. National
   Climate Assessment. There is good agreement between models and
   observations for all regions for the annual warm and cold indices except
   for the warm index in the Northwest. For seasonal values of the
   temperature index, model simulations generally agree with the sign of
   the observed seasonal trends in all regions except for the Northwest and
   a few seasons in the ``warming hole'' areas of the central and
   southeastern United States. Most individual ensemble member simulations
   agree with the sign of the observed trend. However, in all regions and
   seasons, some simulations, in the range of 10\%-40\% of all ensemble
   members, show opposite signs, indicating that even overall skillful
   projections can have substantial uncertainty. These results indicate
   that there is potential skill in use of GCMs to provide projections of
   hot and cold extremes on the 30-yr time scale. However, it is important
   to note that natural variability is comparable to the forced signal on
   this time scale and thus introduces uncertainty. Analysis of the future
   simulations (2006-35) indicates that warm extremes increase rapidly
   while cold extremes become substantially more rare.},

Abstract = {Present study performs the spatial and temporal trend analysis of
   annual, monthly and seasonal maximum and minimum temperatures (t(max),
   t(min)) in India. Recent trends in annual, monthly, winter, pre-monsoon,
   monsoon and post-monsoon extreme temperatures (t(max), t(min)) have been
   analyzed for three time slots viz. 1901-2003,1948-2003 and 1970-2003.
   For this purpose, time series of extreme temperatures of India as a
   whole and seven homogeneous regions, viz. Western Himalaya (WH),
   Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), North Central (NC), East coast (EC),
   West coast (WC) and Interior Peninsula (IP) are considered. Rigorous
   trend detection analysis has been exercised using variety of
   non-parametric methods which consider the effect of serial correlation
   during analysis. During the last three decades minimum temperature trend
   is present in All India as well as in all temperature homogeneous
   regions of India either at annual or at any seasonal level (winter,
   pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). Results agree with the earlier
   observation that the trend in minimum temperature is significant in the
   last three decades over India (Kothawale et al., 2010). Sequential MK
   test reveals that most of the trend both in maximum and minimum
   temperature began after 1970 either in annual or seasonal levels. (C)

Abstract = {Wyoming provides more fossil fuels to the remainder of the United States
   than any other state or country, and its citizens remain skeptical of
   anthropogenic influences on their climate. However, much of the state
   including Yellowstone National Park and the headwaters of several major
   river systems, may have already been affected by rising temperatures.
   This paper examines the historic climate record from Wyoming in the
   context of similar to 14,000-year temperature reconstructions based on
   fossil pollen data. The analysis shows that 24 of 30 U.S. Historical
   Climatology Network records from the state show an increase in the
   frequency of unusually warm years since 1978. Statewide temperatures
   have included 15 years (50\%) from 1978 to 2007 that were greater than 1
   sigma above the mean annual temperature for 1895-1978. The frequent warm
   years coincide with a reduction in the frequency of extremely low (<-20A
   degrees C) January temperatures, and are not well explained by factors
   such as solar irradiance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Linear
   regressions require inclusion of atmospheric greenhouse gas
   concentrations to explain the multi-decadal temperature trends. The
   observed warming is large in Yellowstone National Park where 21 years
   (70\%) from 1978 to 2007 were greater than 1 sigma above the 1895-1978
   mean; the deviation from the mean (> 1A degrees C) is greater than any
   time in the past 6,000 years. Recent temperatures have become as high as
   those experienced from 11,000 to 6,000 years ago when summer insolation
   was > 6\% higher than today and when regional ecosystems experienced
   frequent severe disturbances.},

Abstract = {The long-term temperature profile data sets obtained by Rayleigh lidars
   at three different northern latitudes within the Network for the
   Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change were used to derive the
   middle atmosphere temperature trend and response to the 11 year solar
   cycle. The lidars were located at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii
   (MLO, 19.5 degrees N); the Table Mountain Facility, California (TMF,
   34.4 degrees N); and the Observatoire de Haute Provence, France (OHP,
   43.9 degrees N). A stratospheric cooling trend of 2-3 K/decade was found
   for both TMF and OHP, and a trend of <= 0.5 +/- 0.5 K/decade was found
   at MLO. In the mesosphere, the trend at TMF (3-4 K/decade) was much
   larger than that at both OHP and MLO (<1 K/decade). The lidar trends
   agree well with earlier satellite and rocketsonde trends in the
   stratosphere, but a substantial discrepancy was found in the mesosphere.
   The cooling trend in the upper stratosphere at OHP during 1981-1994
   (similar to 2-3 K/decade) was much larger than that during 1995-2009 (<=
   0.8 K/decade), coincident with the slightly increasing upper
   stratospheric ozone density after 1995. Significant temperature response
   to the 11 year solar cycle was found. The correlation was positive in
   both the stratosphere and mesosphere at MLO and TMF. At OHP a wintertime
   negative response in the upper stratosphere and a positive response in
   the middle mesosphere were observed during 1981-1994, but the opposite
   behavior was found during 1995-2009. This behavior may not be a direct
   solar cycle response at all but is likely related to an apparent
   response to decadal variability (e.g., volcanoes, modulated random
   occurrence of sudden stratospheric warmings) that is more complex.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Measurements of the vertical distribution of atmospheric sodium,
   made at Sao Jose dos Campos (23 degreesS, 46 degreesW) from 1972 to 2001
   show a negligible net long- term trend in the layer over this time
   period. In view of the fact that cooling of the upper atmosphere, as
   indicated by some experimental studies and predicted by models, would be
   expected to influence the vertical distribution of sodium, this result
   can be used to estimate the limits of such cooling. In order to
   investigate the sensitivity of the sodium layer to changes in the
   atmospheric temperature profile, and thus estimate an upper limit to the
   changes it should be possible to detect, we have used a comprehensive
   model for the mesosphere and lower thermosphere ( 65 - 110 km) that
   includes all species and reactions thought to be relevant to the sodium
   chemistry. On the basis of this study we find that the sodium layer
   observations are consistent with model calculations for the global
   effects of increased CO2 but are not consistent with many of the
   experimental studies, which show cooling trends much larger than
   expected from theoretical studies.},

Abstract = {We analyze borehole temperature logs from 101 sites in Russia and nearby
   areas to reconstruct the ground surface temperature history (GSTH) over
   the past five centuries. The data are drawn principally from three
   regions: the Urals, southwest Siberia, and northeast Siberia. We derive
   GSTHs for each region individually, and a composite ``all-Russia{''}
   GSTH from the full ensemble of sites. The results show that over the
   past 500 years, the investigated areas have on average warmed similar
   to1 K, with more than half of the warming occurring in the 20th century
   alone, and 70-80\% in the 19th and 20th centuries taken together. The
   16th through 18th centuries in the Urals and southwest Siberia were on
   average 0.1-0.2 K cooler than at the beginning of the 19th century, but
   northeast Siberia was more moderate in the 16th through 19th centuries,
   relative to the present-day, than the Urals or southwest Siberia. A wide
   variety of instrumental, proxy, and indirect evidence support these
   geothermal results.},

   Along with anthropogenic forcing, we assess the impact of several

   El-Nino/Southern Oscillation, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation, and Antarctic Oscillation. On relatively short
   intervals of the length of two or three decades, contributions of
   climate variability modes are considerable and comparable to the
   contributions of greenhouse gases and even exceed the latter. On longer
   intervals of about half a century and greater, the contributions of

Abstract = {The relationship between the features of the land surface and the
   atmosphere is well identified by its temperature. This parameter is a
   key tool in investigations of relevant energy equilibrium variations.
   The purpose of this research is to identify and analyze Land Surface
   Temperature (LST) variations over Iran using MODIS Aqua data. The
   modified non-parametric Mann-Kendall test is used for examination of
   trend significance, and Sen's slope is used in the calculation of
   changes rate and direction. The results demonstrated that environmental
   factors including land cover and elevation have significant effects on
   LST trend. For inland waters and swamps, positive daytime trends have
   occurred during the warm months of the year, and negative nighttime
   trends have occurred during the cold months. The highest frequency of
   variation per decade corresponds to that between -5 and + 5 degrees
   Celsius per decade (degrees C/Decade). The mountainous regions have
   experienced severe positive daytime variations in the cold months and
   similar changes in the warm months. The findings also indicate that
   changes in land cover and use have resulted in LST variations. There
   have been greater daytime than nighttime such variations, and have
   occurred at far higher rates for four land covers: the bodies of water,
   cropland, urban areas, and barren land. The overall results of the
   research demonstrated that MODIS Aqua LST data are capable of accurately
   monitoring spatiotemporal variations over Iran.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of trends in the diurnal temperature
   ranges (DTRs) of the 70 stations and the role of maximum and minimum
   temperatures on the year-to-year variability and the long-term trends of
   the DTRs in Turkey have been investigated for the period 1929-1999. The
   principal results of the study are as follows:
   (i) The daytime maximum temperatures have shown weak warming and cooling
   in comparison with significant warming of the night-time minimum
   temperatures in many regions of Turkey and in most seasons. (ii) The
   DTRs have significantly decreased at most of the urbanised and rapidly
   urbanising stations throughout the seasons except partly in winter,
   without showing an apparent north/south (west-east) and land/sea
   gradient. (iii) Annual and seasonal DTRs of some stations have shown
   significant increasing trends. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of
   significant increasing trends in the DTR series is geographically
   incoherent across the country in all seasons and annually, as compared
   with significantly decreased DTRs. (iv) Autumn and summer DTRs have
   decreased generally at a higher rate than in winter and spring. (v)
   Changes in the temperature regime of Turkey towards the more temperate
   and/or warmer climate conditions are most strongly related with the
   significant night-time warming in spring and summer. (vi) Magnitudes and
   signs of correlation coefficients and correlation patterns between the
   DTRs and the maximum and minimum temperatures have revealed that there
   is an opposite physical control mechanism on the year-to-year
   variability and the long-term variations and trends in the DTRs,
   particularly for the annual, spring and summer series. (vii) Significant
   increases of the night-time temperatures have most likely led to strong
   decreasing trends in the DTRs of most stations during the spring and
   summer seasons and annually and of some stations during winter and
   autumn. (viii) The asymmetric trends and the symmetric, but with
   different magnitude, trends in the maximum and minimum temperatures
   resulted in a significant decrease in the DTRs of many stations and are
   a considerable signal of ongoing changes in the climatic variability of
   Turkey.},

Abstract = {This paper examines trend uncertainties in layer average free atmosphere
   temperatures arising from the use of different trend estimation methods.
   It also considers statistical issues that arise in assessing the
   significance of individual trends and of trend differences between data
   sets. Possible causes of these trends are not addressed. We use data
   from satellite and radiosonde measurements and from two reanalysis
   projects. To facilitate intercomparison, we compute from reanalyses and
   radiosonde data temperatures equivalent to those from the
   satellite-based Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU). We compare linear trends
   based on minimization of absolute deviations (LA) and minimization of
   squared deviations (LS). Differences are generally less than 0.05
   degrees C/decade over 1959-1996. Over 1979-1993, they exceed 0.10
   degrees C/decade for lower tropospheric time series and 0.15 degrees
   C/decade for the lower stratosphere. Trend fitting by the LA method can
   degrade the lower-tropospheric trend agreement of 0.03 degrees C/decade
   (over 1979-1996) previously reported for the MSU and radiosonde data. In
   assessing trend significance we employ two methods to account for
   temporal autocorrelation effects. With our preferred method, virtually
   none of the individual 1979-1993 trends in deep-layer temperatures are
   significantly different from zero. To examine trend differences between
   data sets we compute 95\% confidence intervals for individual trends and
   show that these overlap for almost all data sets considered. Confidence
   intervals for lower-tropospheric trends encompass both zero and the
   model-projected trends due to anthropogenic effects. We also test the
   significance of a trend in d(t), the time series of differences between
   a pair of data sets. Use of d(t) removes variability common to both time
   series and facilitates identification of small trend differences. This
   more discerning test reveals that roughly 30\% of the data set
   comparisons have significant differences in lower-tropospheric trends,
   primarily related to differences in measurement system. Our study gives
   empirical estimates of statistical uncertainties in recent atmospheric
   temperature trends. These estimates and the simple significance testing
   framework used here facilitate the interpretation of previous
   temperature trend comparisons involving satellite, radiosonde, and
   reanalysis data sets.},

Abstract = {Changes in the annual number of daily maximum and minimum temperature
   threshold exceedences between 1951 and 1993 are assessed at a network of
   22 primarily rural sites in the northeastern United States. After
   adjusting the annual time series for changes in observation time and
   eliminating stations at which nonhomogeneous time series were detected,
   annual rime series of the number of days with maximum temperatures
   greater than or equal to 35.0 degrees, 32.2 degrees, and 29.4 degrees C
   (95 degrees, 90 degrees, and 85 degrees F); maximum temperatures less
   than or equal to 0.0 degrees -6.7 degrees, and -12.2 degrees C (32
   degrees, 20 degrees, and 10 degrees F): minimum temperatures greater
   than or equal to 23.8 degrees, 21.1 degrees, and 18.3 degrees C (75
   degrees, 70 degrees, and 65 degrees F); and minimum temperatures less
   than or equal to -12.2 degrees, -15.0 degrees, and -17.8 degrees C (10
   degrees, 5 degrees, and 0 degrees F) are statistically analyzed.
   Overall, a statistically significant trend toward fewer cold minimum
   temperature threshold exceedences is detected across the region over the
   period from 1959 to 1993. Al stations show a decreasing trend in days
   with minimum temperatures less than or equal to -15.0 degrees C over
   this time period, with significant (alpha = 0.1.) trends present at
   nearly 50\% of the sites. Similarly, significant increases in the
   exceedence of warm minimum temperature thresholds are evident at more
   stations than can be expected by chance. A significant number of trends
   toward fewer warm maximum temperature threshold exceedences is also
   detected over the 1951-1993 time period. However. these trends are most
   likely due to changes in the attributes of the individual stations. Only
   three northern stations show significant increases in cold maximum
   temperature threshold exceedences.},

Title = {Elevation-Dependent Trend in Diurnal Temperature Range in the Northeast
   China during 1961-2015},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The diurnal temperature range (DTR) is considered a signature of
   observed climate change, which is defined as the difference between the
   maximum (T-max) and minimum temperatures (T-min). It is well known that
   the warming rate of mean temperature is larger at high elevations than
   at low elevations in northeast China. However, it is still uncertain
   whether DTR trend is greater at high elevations. This study examined the
   spatiotemporal variation in DTR and its relationship with elevation in
   northeast China based on data from 68 meteorological stations from 1961
   to 2015. The results show that there was a significant declining trend
   (0.252 degrees C/decade) in DTR from 1961 to 2015 due to the fact that
   T-min increased at a faster rate than T-max. Seasonally, DTR in
   northeast China showed a decreasing trend with the largest decrease rate
   in spring (-0.3167 degrees C/decade) and the smallest decrease rate in
   summer (-0.1725 degrees C/decade). The results of correlation analysis
   show that there was a significant positive correlation between the
   annual DTR trend and elevation in northeast China. This is due to the
   fact that increasing elevation has a significant warming effect on
   T-max. Seasonally, there were significant positive correlations between
   the DTR trend and elevation in all seasons. The elevation gradient of
   DTR trend was the greatest in winter (0.392 degrees C/decade/km) and the
   lowest in autumn (0.209 degrees C/decade/km). In spring, summer, and
   autumn, increasing elevation has a significant warming effect on T-max,
   leading to a significant increase of the DTR trend with increasing
   elevation. However, in winter, increasing elevation has a significant
   cooling effect on T-min, resulting in a significant increase of the DTR
   trend with increasing elevation.},

   megacity that has pursued cleaner air for decades, unhealthy levels of

   precursors NOx (nitrogen oxides  NO2 + NO) and VOC (volatile organic
   compounds) have decreased. We describe a combined analysis of decadal
   trends in these precursors, differences in emissions with day-of-week,
   and of the impact of temperature to assess the role of VOC and NOx and
   the likely effects of additional emission reductions on the occurrence
   of high ozone in the region.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {The latest version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model
   (WACCM), which includes a new chemistry scheme and an updated
   parameterization of orographic gravity waves, produces temperature
   trends in the Antarctic lower stratosphere in excellent agreement with
   radiosonde observations for 1969-1998 as regards magnitude, location,
   timing, and persistence. The maximum trend, reached in November at
   100hPa, is -4.42.8Kdecade(-1), which is a third smaller than the largest
   trend in the previous version of WACCM. Comparison with a simulation
   without the updated orographic gravity wave parameterization, together
   with analysis of the model's thermodynamic budget, reveals that the
   reduced trend is due to the effects of a stronger Brewer-Dobson
   circulation in the new simulations, which warms the polar cap. The
   effects are both direct (a trend in adiabatic warming in late spring)
   and indirect (a smaller trend in ozone, hence a smaller reduction in
   shortwave heating, due to the warmer environment).},

Abstract = {The diurnal, seasonal and latitudinal variations of the electron
   temperature in the Earth's topside ionosphere during relatively low
   solar activity period of 2005 - 2008 are investigated. In order to
   examine seasonal variations and morphology of the topside ionospheric

   Presented study is oriented on the dataset gathered in 2005 and 2008.
   Within conducted analysis, global maps of electron temperature for
   months of equinoxes and solstices have been developed. Furthermore,
   simultaneous studies on two-dimensional time series based on DEMETER
   measurements and predictions obtained with the IRI-2012 model supply
   examination of the topside ionosphere during recent deep solar minimum.
   Comparison with the IRI-2012 model reveals discrepancies between data
   and prediction, that are especially prominent during the periods of very

Abstract = {Seasonal changes of extreme daily temperature indices (frequency of
   frost days, tropical nights, and summer days) of 25 stations in the
   Iberian Peninsula (IP) from 1929 to 2005 are investigated. Cluster
   analysis is used to identify homogeneous groups of stations with similar
   thermal regimes. The Mann-Kendall test is applied to look for
   statistically significant trends. The results show a significant
   decreasing trend (-0.6 days/decade), especially from 1965 onwards, in
   the frequency of frost days for coastal stations, and significant
   increasing trends, from 1980 onwards, especially important to the
   southeast of the IP (+3.8 days/decade) for summer tropical nights, and
   in the southern stations (+2.3 days/decade) for summer days. The
   behaviour of the winter frost days index is related to the evolution of
   winter NAO and EA patterns (with increasing trends in the last decades
   of the 20th century). Although multiple regression models establish a
   relationship between summer indices and the SCAN pattern, the behaviour
   of residuals indicates that summer indices must be explained by other
   causal mechanisms. Copyright (c) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {On the basis of the data from Tartu-Toravere Meteorological Station (58
   degrees 16'N, 26 degrees 28'E), changes in solar radiation and
   temperature in Estonia have been studied for the past half century. Two
   different periods have become evident in the analyzed time series of
   solar radiation: a statistically significant decrease in the annual
   totals of global and direct solar radiation has been detected for the
   period from 1955 to the beginning of the 1990s, while opposite trends
   have become evident during more recent years. These changes are in
   correlation with the changes in the amount of low clouds and in the
   transparency of cloudless atmosphere (atmospheric aerosol loading).
   Unlike solar radiation, annual mean temperature has continuously
   increased during 1955-2007. No time intervals with different slopes have
   been found in its time series. Because of the relatively short sunshine
   duration and low Sun elevations, the impact of solar dimming and
   brightening on the observed warming has turned out to be negligible in
   the Baltic Sea region.},

Title = {Interchangeability of multi-decade skin and surface air temperature
   trends over land in models},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH-CLIMATE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Satellite land surface temperature (Ts ) records have now reached 20+
   year length, but their trends may differ from historical records built
   from in-situ measurements of near-surface air temperature (Tas ). In the
   ERA5 reanalysis, 60 degrees S-60 degrees N land Ts and Tas trends can
   differ by up to +/- 0.06 degrees C decade-1 over 20 years, depending on
   the period, or more on smaller spatial scales. Here I use 1979-1998
   outputs from ACCESS1-0 climate model simulations with prescribed land Ts
   to understand changes in Ts and Tas . CO2's effective radiative forcing
   causes adjustments that warm Tas relative to Ts . In ACCESS1-0,
   vegetation enhances the adjustments to CO2 over land. Meanwhile,
   feedbacks in ACCESS1-0 oppose the adjustments, resulting in small
   long-term net effects on global temperature estimates. In coupled
   simulations from other models, there is no agreement on whether Ts or
   Tas warms more and the most extreme case shows global long-term
   differences of just 5\% between land Ts or land Tas trends. The results
   contrast with over-ocean behavior where adjustments and feedbacks
   reinforce each other, and drive larger long-term Tas warming relative to
   Ts across all models.},

Title = {A comprehensive review of compression high-temperature heat pump steam
   system: Status and trend},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRIGERATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {164},
Pages = {218-242},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Compression high -temperature heat pump steam system (HTHPSS) has higher
   energy efficiency than electric, coal-fired and gas boilers for steam
   production. The system efficiently recovers waste heat from the factory
   and the CO 2 emissions can be reduced depending on the driving
   electricity mix, which is in line with the carbon neutral energy saving
   and environmental protection development strategy. However, there are
   few reviews published in the existing literature that specifically
   address the status of research on HTHPSS. This work not only reviews the
   status of research on compression HTHPSS in two directions: increasing
   the efficiency of hightemperature heat pump (HTHP) and increasing the
   steam temperature, respectively, but also indicates the future
   development trend of HTHPSS. The key to the research of HTHP is the
   development of high -temperature refrigerant and high compression ratio
   compressors. In this work, the refrigerants that can be used in HTHP are
   reviewed. Natural refrigerants R718 show promise as HTHP refrigerants
   because they have zero ozone depletion potential (ODP), zero global
   warming potential (GWP) and a high critical temperature. In addition,
   the research status of high -temperature and high-pressure compressor
   with a focus on their design and strategies for reducing the discharge
   temperature of scroll, piston, and screw compressors. The future focus
   of research is to develop a high compression ratio for the compressor.
   Moreover, the three main water vapor compressors, centrifugal, Roots and
   screw compressors, are introduced respectively. Finally, according to
   the operational requirements of the compression HTHPSS, research trend
   and the technical problems to be solved are proposed.},

Title = {On the effect of reference periods on trends in percentile-based extreme
   temperature indices},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {A number of studies have noted that the use of distinct reference
   periods when comparing indices measuring the frequency of days exceeding
   a particular temperature percentile threshold leads to apparently
   different behaviour. We show that these differences arise because of the
   interplay between the increasing temperatures and the choice of
   reference period. The time series of the indicators calculated using the
   different reference periods are offset, as expected, but also diverge.
   Linear trends calculated over the same period from the same underlying
   data but where different reference periods have been used are
   substantially different if a change in climatological conditions has
   occurred between the two reference periods. We show this not only occurs
   in our simple empirical approach, but also for the averages of gridded
   observational and reanalysis datasets and also at a station level. This
   has implications for data set comparisons using trends in temperature
   percentile indices that are based on different reference periods. It
   also has implications for updates to standard reference periods used to
   monitor the climate.},

   Adriatic Sea (Croatia)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Adriatic Sea and its coastal region have experienced significant
   environmental changes in recent decades, aggravated by climate change.
   The most prominent effects of climate change (namely, an increase in sea
   surface and air temperature together with changes in the precipitation
   regime) could have an adverse effect on social and environmental
   processes. In this study, we analyzed the time series of sea surface
   temperature and air temperature measured at three meteorological
   stations in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea. To assess the trends
   and variations in the time series of sea surface and air temperature,
   different statistical methods were employed, i.e., linear and quadratic
   regressions, Mann-Kendall test, Rescaled Adjusted Partial Sums method,
   and autocorrelation. The results evidenced increasing trends in the mean
   annual sea surface temperature and air temperature; furthermore, sudden
   variations in values were observed in 1998 and 1992, respectively.
   Increasing trends in the mean monthly sea surface temperature and air
   temperature occurred in the warmer parts of the year (from March to
   August). The results of this study could provide a foundation for
   stakeholders, decision-makers, and other scientists for developing
   effective measures to mitigate the negative effects of climate change in
   the scattered environment of the Adriatic islands and coastal region.},

Title = {Changes in atmospheric circulation and temperature trends in major
   vineyard regions of New Zealand},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2609-2621},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper contributes to knowledge of the impact of global warming on
   viticulture, using major vineyard regions of New Zealand as a case study
   to illustrate regional disparities in climate change impacts resulting
   from downscale effects of larger scale atmospheric circulation. Recent
   trends in air temperature in New Zealand vineyard areas are
   investigated. Trends since 1941 in Marlborough show an increase in
   temperature range, with both rising maximum temperatures and declining
   minimum temperatures, but no change in the annual mean. More hot days
   and frosts are of concern to viticulturalists, and this trend not only
   differs from other major vineyard areas, but also occurs at other sites
   in eastern parts of the country. The relationship between changes in
   atmospheric circulation over New Zealand and observed trends in
   temperature and frost occurrence at Blenheim is investigated using the
   Kidson weather type classification for the period 1958-2010 and the
   Trenberth M1 index. The increased temperature range is expected to be
   associated with more frequent clear skies along the east coast of the
   country, resulting from changes in weather patterns (more frequent
   anticyclones, fewer low-pressure systems, increased zonal and southerly
   flow). These changes in weather patterns are shown to be closely linked
   to larger scale changes in atmospheric circulation via the Southern
   Annular Mode (SAM) and Southern Oscillation. The results show that
   significant regional variations in the impact of global warming can
   occur over areas of complex terrain such as New Zealand. Observed
   differences in local temperature and frost trends can be caused by the
   interaction of changing weather systems with mountainous terrain. These
   changing weather systems themselves are seen to be the result of major
   shifts in the larger scale atmospheric circulation. These results are
   important for assessing possible impacts on viticulture and in
   developing adaptation strategies for agriculture in response to
   predicted future climates.},

Title = {Trend analysis of long-term temperature time series in the Greater

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {101},
Number = {3-4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As the majority of the world's population is living in urban
   environments, there is growing interest in studying local urban
   climates. In this paper, for the first time, the long-term trends
   (31-162 years) of temperature change have been analyzed for the Greater
   Toronto Area (GTA). Annual and seasonal time series for a number of
   urban, suburban, and rural weather stations are considered.
   Non-parametric statistical techniques such as Mann-Kendall test and
   Theil-Sen slope estimation are used primarily for the assessing of the
   significance and detection of trends, and the sequential Mann test is
   used to detect any abrupt climate change. Statistically significant
   trends for annual mean and minimum temperatures are detected for almost
   all stations in the GTA. Winter is found to be the most coherent season
   contributing substantially to the increase in annual minimum
   temperature. The analyses of the abrupt changes in temperature suggest
   that the beginning of the increasing trend in Toronto started after the
   1920s and then continued to increase to the 1960s. For all stations,
   there is a significant increase of annual and seasonal (particularly
   winter) temperatures after the 1980s. In terms of the linkage between
   urbanization and spatiotemporal thermal patterns, significant linear
   trends in annual mean and minimum temperature are detected for the
   period of 1878-1978 for the urban station, Toronto, while for the rural
   counterparts, the trends are not significant. Also, for all stations in
   the GTA that are situated in all directions except south of Toronto,
   substantial temperature change is detected for the periods of 1970-2000
   and 1989-2000. It is concluded that the urbanization in the GTA has
   significantly contributed to the increase of the annual mean
   temperatures during the past three decades. In addition to urbanization,
   the influence of local climate, topography, and larger scale warming are
   incorporated in the analysis of the trends.},

Abstract = {Since 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has
   heavily relied on the comparison between global climate model hindcasts
   and global surface temperature (ST) estimates for concluding that
   post-1950s global warming is mostly human-caused. In Connolly et al., we
   cautioned that this approach to the detection and attribution of climate
   change was highly dependent on the choice of Total Solar Irradiance
   (TSI) and ST data sets. We compiled 16 TSI and five ST data sets and
   found by altering the choice of TSI or ST, one could (prematurely)
   conclude anything from the warming being ``mostly human-caused{''} to
   ``mostly natural.{''} Richardson and Benestad suggested our analysis was
   ``erroneous{''} and ``flawed{''} because we did not use a multilinear
   regression. They argued that applying a multilinear regression to one of
   the five ST series re-affirmed the IPCC's attribution statement. They
   also objected that many of the published TSI data sets were out-of-date.
   However, here we show that when applying multilinear regression analysis
   to an expanded and updated data set of 27 TSI series, the original
   conclusions of Connolly et al. are confirmed for all five ST data sets.
   Therefore, it is still unclear whether the observed warming is mostly
   human-caused, mostly natural or some combination of both.},

Title = {Regional Response to Global Warming: Water Temperature Trends in
   Semi-Natural Mountain River Systems},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {River water temperature (TW) is a key environmental factor that
   determines the quality of the fluvial environment and its suitability
   for aquatic organisms. Atmospheric warming, accompanied by more frequent
   extreme weather phenomena, especially heat waves and prolonged drought,
   may pose a serious threat to the river environment and native river
   ecosystems. Therefore, reliable and up-to-date information on current
   and anticipated changes in river flow and thermal conditions is
   necessary for adaptive water resource management and planning. This
   study focuses on semi-natural mountain river systems to reliably assess
   the magnitude of water temperature change in the Polish Carpathians in
   response to climatic warming. The Mann-Kendall test was used to detect
   trends in water temperature series covering the last 35 years
   (1984-2018). Significant, rising trends in annual water temperature were
   found for all studied sites, with differences in intensity (0.33-0.92
   degrees C per decade). Trends in TW were strongest in summer and autumn
   (0.75-1.17 and 0.51-1.08 degrees C per decade), strong trends were found
   in spring (0.82-0.95 degrees C per decade), and weaker in winter
   (0.25-0.29 degrees C per decade). Simultaneous air temperature trends
   were broadly consistent with water temperature trends. This indicates
   the urgent need for adaptive management strategies to counteract thermal
   degradation of the fluvial environment under study.},

Abstract = {Spatial and sequential variability of extreme temperature events enthral
   the scientific community owing to their significant impact on global
   climate change. This study analysed trends in monthly data of
   temperature extremes of 23 meteorological stations of Bangladesh using
   Mann-Kendall test. Most of the stations showed significant increasing
   trend for both temperature extremes on monthly and annual scales. Most
   of the change points were detected during the last four decades and
   showed an upward trend. The results obtained from Sen's estimator
   vouchsafed that magnitudes of trend ranged from 0.007 degrees C to 0.034
   degrees C per year and 0.014 degrees C to 0.049 degrees C per year for
   minimum and maximum temperature, respectively. The upward trend in both
   extreme temperatures pointed to global warming. The maximum number of
   significant trends was observed in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons for
   average maximum temperature. The upward trend in the monsoon and
   post-monsoon season may cause the drought and late winter in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Earth surface temperatures are changing worldwide together with the

   trends and variations of monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and
   their effects on seasonal fluctuations at different climatological

   was performed on annual and seasonal mean maximum temperature (TMAX) and
   mean minimum temperature (TMIN) for the period 1969 to 2006. During the
   last 38 years, an increase in annual TMAX and TMIN has occurred. At most
   of the locations, the increase in TMAX was faster than the TMIN,
   resulting in an increase in diurnal temperature range. At the same time,
   annual mean temperature (TM) showed a significant increase over the
   study area. Percentiles were used to identify extreme temperature
   indices. An increase in occurrence of warm extremes was observed at
   southern locations, and cold extremes increased over the central and
   northeastern part of the study area. Occurrences of cold wave conditions
   have decreased rapidly compared to heat wave conditions.},

Abstract = {The maximum exergy dissipation theory provides a theoretical basis for
   using surface temperature to measure the status and development of
   ecosystems, which could provide an early warning of rapid evaluation of
   ecosystem degradation. In the present study, we used the radiation
   balance of ecosystems to demonstrate this hypothesis theoretically.
   Further, we used empirical data to verify whether ecosystems gain more
   radiation, while lowering their surface temperatures, as they develop
   naturally. We analyzed 12 chronosequences from the FLUXNET database
   using meteorological data and heat fluxes. We included age, disturbance,
   and successional chronosequences across six climate zones. Net radiation
   (R (n)) and the ratio of net radiation to global radiation (R (n)/R (g))
   were used to measure the energy gain of the ecosystems. The maximum
   daily air temperature above the canopy (T (max)) and thermal response
   number (TRN) were used to analyze the surface temperature trends with
   ecosystem natural development. The general trends of T (max), TRN, R
   (n), and R (n) /R (g) demonstrated that ecosystems become cooler and
   more stable, yet gain more energy, throughout their natural development.
   Among the four indicators, TRN showed the most consistent trends and
   highest sensitivity to ecosystem growth, succession, and recovery.
   Moreover, TRN was not significantly influenced by precipitation or wind.
   We propose that TRN can be used to rapidly evaluate or warn of ecosystem
   disturbance, senescence, and degradation without prior knowledge of
   species composition, nutrient status, and complex ecosystem processes.},

Abstract = {Average air temperature variation in the period 1975-2011 was analyzed
   across 34 locations from a broad range of Mesoamerican countries with
   the view to better inform agricultural scientists of what changes to
   expect up to, and including, the year 2025. Such changes are likely to
   influence a range of constraints to agricultural and horticultural
   productivity and therefore ensuring such estimates are as robust as
   possible is critical to guide breeders, pathologists, entomologists and
   agronomists in the region effectively. A surprising variability in
   temperature trends were elicited for the region with increases ranging
   from the equivalent of 0 to > 4 degrees C per hundred years but these
   trends were not associated with either the geographical positioning of
   the locations with reference to the Central Cordillera nor were they
   associated with surface elevation which ranged across sites from 0 to
   around 2,000 m. In Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and
   Panama there were sites in each country showing both increases in
   average air temperature and also sites showing no apparent change over
   the period 1975-2011. AVRDC and CATIE are promulgating the concept of
   `healthy landscapes' in Mesoamerica and as such both Centers seek to
   ensure the greater local production and consumption of nutrient-dense
   fruit and vegetables which are required to play an important role in
   combating the pervasive malnutrition still found amongst disadvantaged
   populations in the region. In addition, the most common vegetable crops
   of the region presently have yields that are seriously impaired by
   viruses, diseases and insects. All of these constraints are likely to be
   further exacerbated by increases in air temperature by 2025. Farmers
   respond to these growing challenges by spraying increasing amounts of
   pesticides, often in excessive amounts. Thus to create a more healthy
   environment for farm families, with less need for spraying, and to
   relieve crops of the unnecessary burden of diseases and insects which
   are compromising their natural yield potential - much more investment
   will be needed into horticultural research and development extension in
   the region, particularly in building the capacity of regional vegetable
   scientists in both the public and private sectors. Lines with better
   heat and drought tolerance and with improved resistance to the common
   viruses and diseases are already available from AVRDC's breeders and
   CATIE's horticulturalists. More consistent and extensive field testing
   and seed production of this material at regional hotspot locations will
   be required to tailor these appropriately to Mesoamerican countries. The
   means to make such improved seed widely available from local sources to
   poor farming communities across the region must also be a first priority
   as current imported seed is both expensive and often ill adapted.},

Abstract = {Historical climate simulations of the period 1861-2000 using two new
   Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) global climate models
   (CM2.0 and CM2.1) are compared with observed surface temperatures.
   All-forcing runs include the effects of changes in well-mixed greenhouse
   gases, ozone, sulfates, black and organic carbon, volcanic aerosols,
   solar flux, and land cover. Indirect effects of tropospheric aerosols on
   clouds and precipitation processes are not included. Ensembles of size 3
   (CM2.0) and 5 (CM2.1) with all forcings are analyzed, along with smaller
   ensembles of natural-only and anthropogenic-only forcing, and
   multicentury control runs with no external forcing.
   Observed warming trends on the global scale and in many regions are
   simulated more realistically in the all-forcing and anthropogenic-only
   forcing runs than in experiments using natural-only forcing or no
   external forcing. In the all-forcing and anthropogenic-only forcing
   runs, the model shows some tendency for too much twentieth-century
   warming in lower latitudes and too little warming in higher latitudes.
   Differences in Arctic Oscillation behavior between models and
   observations contribute substantially to an underprediction of the
   observed warming over northern Asia. In the all-forcing and natural-only
   forcing runs, a temporary global cooling in the models during the 1880s
   not evident in the observed temperature records is volcanically forced.
   El Nino interactions complicate comparisons of observed and simulated
   temperature records for the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo eruptions during
   the early 1980s and early 1990s.
   The simulations support previous findings that twentieth-century global
   warming has resulted from a combination of natural and anthropogenic
   forcing, with anthropogenic forcing being the dominant cause of the
   pronounced late-twentieth-century warming. The regional results provide
   evidence for an emergent anthropogenic warming signal over many, if not
   most, regions of the globe. The warming signal has emerged rather
   monotonically in the Indian Ocean/western Pacific warm pool during the
   past half-century. The tropical and subtropical North Atlantic and the
   tropical eastern Pacific are examples of regions where the anthropogenic
   warming signal now appears to be emerging from a background of more
   substantial multidecadal variability.},

Abstract = {A retrospective analysis of the cases of 173 patients operated on for
   aneurysms and admitted to a neurosurgical service early after
   subarachnoid hemorrhage was conducted with respect to white blood cell
   (WBC) count and highest daily temperature. Daily trends for the
   development of clinically vasospasm (VSP) as well as mortality during
   the hospitilization were analyzed. An admission WBC count greater than
   15 .times. 109/l was associated with 55\% mortality as opposed to 25\%
   mortality for those with a lower WBC count. The mortality of those with
   a temperature greater than 37.5.degree.C on Day 0 was 60\%, compared
   with 35\% for those with a lower temperature. A WBC count greater than
   15 .times. 109/l on Day 0 was associated with a VSP rate of 40\%, while
   patients with lower temperature had a VSP rate of 30\%. By Day 6, the
   patients with temperatures > 37.5.degree.C had a VSP rate of 60\%,
   double that of the VSP rate of those with temperatures < 37.degree.C.
   WBC count was apparently more closely linked to the chance  of dying
   than the chance of developing VSP. The development of fever after a few
   days is related to both increased mortality and increased chance of
   developing VSP.},

Abstract = {This study assesses near surface lapse rates and temperatures over the
   past decade at two heights from the Oklahoma Mesonet. A statistically
   significant change in lapse rate was detected of -0.21 +/- 0.09 degrees
   C (10 m)(-1) per decade. The trend of nighttime lapse rate was about
   three times larger than the magnitude of trend of the daytime lapse
   rate. The lapse rate trends at the time of the daily maximum and minimum
   temperatures were larger during calm conditions. Significantly, changes
   of temperature trends at a single height were inconclusive when the data
   was not segmented by wind speed classes. For daily maximum and minimum
   station series at two heights, the temperature trends of these station
   series were the largest for daily minimum temperature at 1.5 m under
   calm conditions, and the second largest for daily minimum temperatures
   at 9.0 m under calm conditions. These observations document that
   monitoring long term near-surface daily minimum temperature trends at a
   single level on light wind nights will not produce the same trends as
   for long term temperature trends at other heights near the surface.},

Title = {Trends in the Air Temperature: A Practical Approach for Auto- and
   Cross-Correlation Analysis},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {2024},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {We study the air temperature with 10 years of hourly measured in 12
   automatic weather stations, located in the State of Bahia (Brazil),
   considering mainly its auto- and cross-correlation. We found that, in
   general, there is a positive linear trend, indicating warming in this
   variable for all stations. Also, we observe that the probability
   distribution function clearly exhibits a bimodal distribution, meaning
   that there are two main seasonal cycles (the largest relating to winter,
   the other to summer). In order to have a more robust statistical
   analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method was applied in
   these time-series to analyzing data where traditional methods might
   struggle due to nonstationary. In this case, DFA was useful in
   identifying long-range autocorrelations in these time-series (with
   persistent and antipersistent behavior) with specific seasonal
   time-scales (1 day and 1 year). However, if we quantify the
   cross-correlations between the air temperature in Salvador and the other
   stations, by rho DCCA, we found that detrended cross-correlation
   analysis cross-correlation coefficient is always positive with two
   peaks, the first is located at n=24 (1 day) and the second at n=8766 (1
   year). In this sense, rho DCCA coefficient provides insights how air
   temperature in Salvador is correlated with air temperature in other
   weather stations over different time-scales, helping to understand their
   long-term interactions. These results, for example, allow us to identify
   temporal scales that may be useful to better understand trends in the
   air temperature and that can help us further answer global warming
   questions.},

Abstract = {Instrumental records suggest multidecadal variability in Arctic surface
   temperature throughout the twentieth century. This variability is caused
   by a combination of external forcing and internal variability, but their
   relative importance remains unclear. Since the early twentieth century
   Arctic warming has been linked to decadal variability in the Pacific, we
   hypothesize that the Pacific could impact decadal temperature trends in
   the Arctic throughout the twentieth century. To investigate this, we
   compare two ensembles of historical all-forcing twentieth century
   simulations with the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM): (1) a fully
   coupled ensemble and (2) an ensemble where momentum flux anomalies from
   reanalysis are prescribed over the Indo-Pacific Ocean to constrain
   Pacific sea surface temperature variability. We find that the combined
   effect of tropical and extratropical Pacific decadal variability can
   explain up to similar to 50\% of the observed decadal surface
   temperature trends in the Arctic. The Pacific-Arctic connection involves
   both lower tropospheric horizontal advection and subsidence-induced
   adiabatic heating, mediated by Aleutian Low variations. This link is
   detected across the twentieth century, but the response in Arctic
   surface temperature is moderated by external forcing and surface
   feedbacks. Our results also indicate that increased ocean heat transport
   from the Atlantic to the Arctic could have compensated for the impact of
   a cooling Pacific at the turn of the twenty-first century. These results
   have implications for understanding the present Arctic warming and
   future climate variations.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Printing technologies have been attracting increasing interest in the
   manufacture of electronic devices and sensors. They offer a unique set
   of advantages such as additive material deposition and low to no
   material waste, digitally-controlled design and printing, elimination of
   multiple steps for device manufacturing, wide material compatibility and
   large scale production to name but a few. Some of the most popular and
   interesting sensors are relative humidity, temperature and strain
   sensors. In that regard, this review analyzes the utilization and
   involvement of printing technologies for full or partial sensor
   manufacturing; production methods, material selection, sensing
   mechanisms and performance comparison are presented for each category,
   while grouping of sensor sub-categories is performed in all applicable
   cases. A key aim of this review is to provide a reference for sensor
   designers regarding all the aforementioned parameters, by highlighting
   strengths and weaknesses for different approaches in printed humidity,
   temperature and strain sensor manufacturing with printing technologies.},

Title = {Do Surface Temperature Indices Reflect Centennial-Timescale Trends in

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The difference between North Atlantic subpolar gyre sea surface
   temperatures (SPG SSTs) and hemispheric- or global-scale surface
   temperatures has been utilized as an index of centennial-timescale
   changes in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength.
   Here, using Community Earth System Model ensembles, we show that surface
   temperature-based indices (STIs) proposed to date largely reflect
   global-scale temperature trends and thus do not reflect dynamical
   relationships with AMOC. More broadly, we find that relationships
   between STIs, SPG SSTs, and AMOC strength differ greatly in significance
   and magnitude over different time periods because they are dependent
   upon the nature of external forcing. In the twentieth century,
   characterized by offsetting greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing, the
   relationship between SSTs and AMOC strength varies widely and changes
   sign across a 20-member ensemble. We conclude that STIs and SPG SSTs are
   poor predictors of centennial-timescale AMOC strength variations.},

Abstract = {Vegetation growth and productivity may record signals of global climate
   change since vegetation is sensitive to modifications in climatic
   variables, such as temperature and precipitation. Significant changes in
   vegetation growth and productivity can affect the exchange of energy,
   water vapor, and momentum between the land surface and atmosphere.
   Despite consensus on the vegetation growth enhancement by the warming of
   temperature, little attention has been given to the understanding of the
   impacts of cooling temperature trends on vegetation growth and
   productivity. Based on satellite-derived land surface temperatures and
   vegetation indices, this study shows that alternating temperature trends
   are more reasonable than a monotonic temperature trend for the study
   period from 2003 to 2016. More importantly, results reveal that both
   warming and cooling temperature trends can have a positive impact on
   vegetation growth over the continental United States. These findings are
   of importance to understand global carbon cycle sinks and sources
   accurately in different regions.},

Title = {A Vibration Energy Approach Used to Identify Temperature Trending in

Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Bearing temperature trending is a phenomenon that has plagued the
   railroad industry for decades and has resulted in costly train stoppages
   and non-verified bearing removals. Initial experimental studies
   conducted at The University of Texas-Pan American to explore this
   troubling phenomenon identified potential sources for the abrupt changes
   in temperature exhibited by some railroad bearings. The authors
   hypothesize that vibration-induced roller-misalignment is the root cause
   for bearing temperature trending. Hence, subsequent research focused on
   providing validation for the proposed hypothesis through vibration
   monitoring techniques. To that end, dynamic testers were used to run
   railroad bearings at the various speeds and loads that they experience
   in the field. A ``trigger{''} bearing with a known cup raceway defect
   was used as a vibration source to induce roller misalignment on
   neighbouring defect-free bearings. Results show that the vibration
   energy of a bearing would decrease prior to an increase in temperature.
   In theory, misaligned rollers would vibrate less, leading to a decrease
   in the overall vibration energy, while also generating sufficient
   friction to account for the observed temperature increase. Typically,
   rollers realign themselves through geometrical thermal expansions or
   changes in the operating conditions, thus, returning to normal
   temperature and vibration levels. This paper outlines the research
   findings.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed long-term (1950-2009) annual and seasonal time
   series data of maximum and minimum temperature from 249 uniformly
   distributed stations across the State of North Carolina, United States.
   The Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen approach were applied to quantify the
   significance and magnitude of trend, respectively. A pre-whitening
   technique was applied to eliminate the effect of lag-1 serial
   correlation. For most stations over the period of the past 60 years, the
   difference between minimum and maximum temperatures was found decreasing
   with an overall increasing trend in the mean temperature. However,
   significant trends (confidence level a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts
   per thousand 95 \%) in the mean temperature analysis were detected only
   in 20, 3, 23, and 20 \% of the stations in summer, winter, autumn, and
   spring, respectively. The magnitude of the highest warming trend in
   minimum temperature and the highest cooling trend in maximum temperature
   was +0.073 A degrees C/year in the autumn season and -0.12 A degrees
   C/year in the summer season, respectively. Additional analysis in mean
   temperature trend was conducted on three regions of North Carolina
   (mountain, piedmont, and coastal). The results revealed a warming trend
   for the coastal zone, a cooling trend for the mountain zone, and no
   distinct trend for the piedmont zone. The Sequential Mann-Kendall test
   results indicated that the significant increasing trends in minimum
   temperature and decreasing trend in maximum temperature had begun around
   1970 and 1960 (change point), respectively, in most of the stations.
   Finally, the comparison between mean surface air temperature (SAT) and
   the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) concluded that the variability and
   trend in SAT can be explained partially by the NAO index for North
   Carolina.},

Abstract = {A 50-m firn core drilled in Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica, during
   the 1996/1997 Chinese First Antarctic Inland Expedition, has been
   measured for delta(18)O and major ions. Based on the high quality of the
   seasonal variations of major ions, the firn core was dated with errors
   within +/-3 years. The features of the temperature change in the past
   150 years in the investigated region have first been studied based on
   the oxygen isotope in the upper 32.93 m of the firn core. Results show
   that the temperature decreased nearly by 2degreesC in Princess Elizabeth
   Land in the past 150 years. On the background of the global, especially
   the Southern Hemispheric warming in the past 150 years, a temperature
   decline of 2degreesC in Princess Elizabeth Land likely reflects the
   impacts of the unique Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, the
   Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW) and the special terrain (such as the
   large drainage basins) on the coastal regions of Antarctica.},

Abstract = {Experimental data on measurements of the nitric oxide NO content in the
   mid-latitude lower thermosphere demonstrate its significant dependence
   on solar (and correspondingly) geomagnetic activity, which varies from
   undisturbed to strongly disturbed conditions up to three or four times
   or more. Such a dependence of {[}NO] on heliogeophysical factors cannot
   but affect the content of NO+ ions, which predominate (together with
   ions) at heights of 105-120 km. The analysis in the present work has
   confirmed this assumption: the phi(+) = {[}NO+]/{[}O-2(+)] ratio in the
   mid-latitude E layer of the ionosphere is indeed intricately correlated
   with solar activity. At the same time, data from vertical sounding of
   the ionosphere for 86 years of observations indicates a systematic
   multiyear increase of the critical frequency of the E layer (foE) at a
   fixed level of solar activity. Taking into account these circumstances
   made it possible to estimate the long-term variations of the neutral
   atmosphere temperature near the peak height of the E layer (hmE =
   110-115 km). The calculations showed that between1931 and 2017, the
   annual mean temperature of the mid-latitude lower thermosphere increased
   at a linear rate exceeding 0.3-0.5 K/yr.},

Abstract = {Confounding factors like urbanization and land-use change could
   introduce uncertainty to the estimation of global temperature trends
   related to climate change. In this work, we introduce a new way to
   investigate the nexus between temporal trends of temperature and
   urbanization data at the global scale in the period from 1992 to 2013.
   We analyze air temperature data recorded from more than 5000 weather
   stations worldwide and nightlight satellite measurements as a proxy for
   urbanization. By means of a range of statistical methods, our results
   quantify and outline that the temporal evolution of urbanization affects
   temperature trends at multiple spatial scales with significant
   differences at regional and continental scales. A statistically
   significant agreement in temperature and nightlight trends is detected,
   especially in low and middle-income regions, where urbanization is
   rapidly growing. Conversely, in continents such as Europe and North
   America, increases in temperature trends are typically detected along
   with non-significant nightlight trends.},

Abstract = {Soil temperature, an important indicator of climate change, has rarely
   explored due to scarce observations, especially in the Tibetan Plateau
   (TP) area. In this study, changes observed in five meteorological
   variables obtained from the TP between 1960 and 2014 were investigated
   using two non-parametric methods, the modified Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's slope estimator method. Analysis of annual series from 1960 to
   2014 has shown that surface (0cm), shallow (5-20cm), deep (40-320 cm)
   soil temperatures (ST), mean air temperature (AT), and precipitation (P)
   increased with rates of 0.47 degrees C/decade, 0.36 degrees C/decade,
   0.36 degrees C/decade, 0.35 degrees C/decade, and 7.36 mm/decade,
   respectively, while maximum frozen soil depth (MFD) as well as snow
   cover depth (MSD) decreased with rates of 5.58 and 0.07 cm/decade.
   Trends were significant at 99 or 95\% confidence level for the
   variables, with the exception of P and MSD. More impressive rate of the
   ST at each level than the AT indicates the clear response of soil to
   climate warming on a regional scale. Monthly changes observed in surface
   ST in the past decades were consistent with those of AT, indicating a
   central place of AT in the soil warming. In addition, with the exception
   of MFD, regional scale increasing trend of P as well as the decreasing
   MSD also shed light on the mechanisms driving soil trends. Significant
   negative-dominated correlation coefficients (alpha = 0.05) between ST
   and MSD indicate the decreasing MSD trends in TP were attributable to
   increasing ST, especially in surface layer. Owing to the frozen ground,
   the relationship between ST and P is complicated in the area. Higher P
   also induced higher ST, while the inhibition of freeze and thaw process
   on the ST in summer. With the increasing AT, P accompanied with the
   decreasing MFD, MSD should be the major factors induced the conspicuous
   soil warming of the TP in the past decades.},

Title = {Sea surface temperature anomalies, seasonal cycle and trend regimes in
   the Eastern Pacific coast},
Journal = {OCEAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-90},
Abstract = {We used the extended reconstruction of sea surface temperature (ERSST)
   to analyze the variation of surface temperature and the seasonal cycle
   along the coast of the eastern Pacific (60 degrees N-60 degrees S, 61
   pixels alongshore) from 1950 to 2010 (732 months). First, we analyzed
   the monthly anomalies and looked for a relationship of such anomalies
   with total solar irradiance (TSI) and then the Regime Shift Detector
   (RSD) was applied to detect possible temperature regimes in the series.
   Afterwards, we calculated a yearly temperature range per pixel
   (amplitude of seasonal cycle) and through the subtraction of a
   latitudinal theoretical curve of temperature based on solar irradiance,
   the residuals of the seasonal cycle were obtained. The results showed an
   almost complete spatial synchrony and dominance of negative anomalies
   from 1950 to mid-late 1970's, with a switch to near-zero and positive
   anomalies that lasted up to late 1990's when a new shift to negative
   values was detected. Such a shift lasted until the early 2000's when
   positive anomalies appeared again but there was a change to negative
   anomalies in the late 2000's. These results were supported by the RSD.
   The TSI variability shows a clear relationship with that of sea surface
   temperature anomalies and with the regime changes. This is probably due
   to a difference in the amount of energy received from the sun. Comparing
   the ``cool regime{''} versus the ``warm regime{''}, the second one
   received 0.39\% more energy (approximately 3x10(8) Jm(-2)) from the sun.
   Seasonal cycles show larger ranges at northern latitudes (>40 degrees
   N), northern tropical-temperate transition zone (20 degrees-26 degrees
   N) and in the tropical-equatorial band (0 degrees-30 degrees S). The
   smallest ranges occur at 0 degrees-16 degrees N and 50 degrees-60
   degrees S. The residuals (seasonal minus the theoretical curve)
   indicated a clear modulation due to advection by ocean currents.},

Abstract = {Based on the 120-station North American radiosonde network, temperature
   trends for 100-50-mb (low stratosphere), 300-100-mb (tropopause), and
   850-300-mb (troposphere) layers, and Earth's surface, are evaluated for
   six 10 degrees latitude bands extending from 20 degrees-30 degrees N to
   70 degrees-80 degrees N for the 20-yr interval 1975-94. Confidence
   estimates are indicated by two standard errors of the least squares
   regression. In the average for the six latitude bands, the 100-50-mb
   annual temperature trend is -0.5 degrees C decade(-1) and the 850-300-mb
   trend is 0.2 degrees C decade(-1). In spring at 70 degrees-80 degrees N,
   the 100-50-mb and 300-100-mb layers cool by almost 2 degrees C
   decade(-1). The 300-100-mb layer cools by 0.7 degrees C decade(-1)
   relative to the 850-300-mb layer at 70 degrees-80 degrees N, but the two
   layers have the same warming trend at 20 degrees-30 degrees N,
   indicating the transition from the 300-100-mb layer being mostly in the
   stratosphere in polar regions to mostly in the troposphere in the
   northern subtropics. The surface warms much more than the troposphere at
   70 degrees-80 degrees N (showing that surface temperature trends are not
   representative of tropospheric trends in polar regions) and slightly
   more at 20 degrees-30 degrees N, bur surface warming is less than
   tropospheric warming in the 40 degrees-70 degrees N belt. Ar the surface
   at the radiosonde sites the 1200 UTC (morning) temperature cools
   relative to the 0000 UTC (evening) temperature by 0.05 degrees C per
   decade on average, but the 850-300-mb temperature trends at 0000 UTC and
   1200 UTC are essentially the same. The 0.7 degrees C decade(-1) cooling
   of low stratosphere relative to troposphere increases to 0.9 degrees C
   decade(-1) when adjustment is made for the stratospheric warming and
   tropospheric cooling following El Chichon and Pinatubo eruptions. The
   temperature trends obtained from 11 North American radiosonde stations
   in a 63-station global network agree well with the trends based on the
   entire 120-station network, and the latter are fairly representative of
   zonally averaged trends based on the 63-station network and microwave
   sounding unit data, Comparison with Canadian ozonesonde data shows that.
   in the low stratosphere and high troposphere during 1975-94, a decrease
   in temperature of 1 degrees C decade(-1) was associated with a decrease
   in ozone of about 10\% decade(-1).},

Abstract = {Urbanization has led to the emergence of surface urban heat islands
   (SUHI) and air pollution, necessitating comprehensive investigations
   into the urbanization process. This study explores the impact of
   urbanization on temperature trends in northern Iran using remote sensing
   and neural networks. MODIS images from 2001, 2010, and 2019 were
   employed to determine climatic features and vegetation levels. SUHI
   indices and the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) were utilized
   to assess ecological comfort and urban heat islands. Markov chain
   methods were used for forecasting future thermal pollution. The
   relationship between temperature, air pollutants, spectral indices, and
   thermal indices was investigated through regression analysis.
   Furthermore, multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF),
   and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks were employed for
   predicting indicator values. The findings reveal an increase in thermal
   pollution indicated by elevated Land Surface Temperature (LST), SUHI,
   and UTFVI values, along with a decrease in Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) values between 2001 and 2019. The Urbanization
   Index (UI) values demonstrate a 5\% increase in urban areas during the
   same period. The UTFVI values suggest a decline in ecological comfort
   due to urbanization and reduced vegetation, with the majority of the
   region experiencing the poorest thermal comfort in 2019. The SUHI index
   peaked at 11.72 in 2019, with the highest values observed in spring and
   the lowest in winter. Correlation analysis highlights a significant
   relationship between LST and various factors, including SUHI, UTFVI,
   CH4, SO2, and CO2, underscoring the influence of temperature increase on
   pollution escalation in the study area. Air pollution assessment
   indicates the highest concentration of CO gas in the northern and
   southern parts of the region. Tehran exhibits the highest CO gas levels
   at 0.051 ppm, while Golestan records the lowest at 0.012 ppm. SO2 levels
   reach their peak in northern regions (0.0088 ppm) and are lowest in
   southern regions (0 ppm). The Markov and CA-Markov chain methods predict
   that by 2050, approximately 50\% of the region will experience high
   temperatures. Neural network results demonstrate that the LSTM method
   outperforms MLP and RBF methods, with R2 values of 0.99 and 0.98,
   respectively, indicating higher accuracy in LST prediction during
   testing and validation stages. Overall, this study highlights the
   potential of neural networks in predicting thermal pollution and
   facilitating effective land management strategies in urban areas.(c)

Abstract = {The northernmost Limpopo Province is located in one of the warmest
   regions of South Africa, where the agricultural sector is prone to heat
   stress. The aim of this study was to explore air temperature and
   relative humidity trends for the region, which have implications for
   agricultural adaptation and management (amongst other sectors). In
   particular, we investigated seasonal, annual and decadal scale air
   temperature and relative humidity changes for the period 1950-2016.
   Positive temperature trends were recorded for this period, averaging
   +0.02 degrees C/year, with the strongest changes observed in mean
   maximum summer temperatures (+0.03 degrees C/year). Interannual
   temperature variability also increased over time, especially for the
   period 2010-2016, which presents probability densities of <50\% for
   minimum temperatures. Positive relative humidity trends (+0.06\%/year)
   were also recorded for the period 1980- 2016, but proved to be the least
   predictable weather parameter, with probability densities of <0.5\%
   across seasons for the study period. Considering the substantial
   interannual variability in temperature and relative humidity, there is
   clear increased risk for the agricultural sector, particularly for
   small-scale farmers who generally have limited capacity to adapt.
   Climate science focusing on the southern African region should continue
   to establish the impact of climate change and variability on specific
   small-scale farming systems and enterprises, with recommendations for
   strategic adaptation based on up-to-date evidence. Significance: center
   dot Heat indices have increased, and variability in temperature and
   relative humidity has substantially increased over recent decades.
   center dot Changes in air temperature and relative humidity have direct
   and/or indirect negative effects on sectors such as agriculture, leading
   to reduced productivity. center dot The small-scale farming sector,
   which contributes significantly to national food security in developing
   countries, is the production system most exposed and vulnerable to
   observed changes/extremes in temperature and relative humidity. center
   dot There is an urgent need to build capacity of small-scale farmers for
   appropriate adaptation to observed changes in climate based on
   up-to-date evidence.},

Title = {Gap Filling of Monthly Temperature Data and Its Effect on Climatic

Abstract = {Observational datasets of climatic variables are frequently composed of
   fragmentary time series covering different time spans and plagued with
   data gaps. Most statistical methods and environmental models, however,
   require serially complete data, so gap filling is a routine procedure.
   However, very often this preliminary stage is undertaken with no
   consideration of the potentially adverse effects that it can have on
   further analyses. In addition to numerical effects and trade-offs that
   are inherent to any imputation method, observational climatic datasets
   often exhibit temporal changes in the number of available records, which
   result in further spurious effects if the gap-filling process is
   sensitive to it. We examined the effect of data reconstruction in a
   large dataset of monthly temperature records spanning over several
   decades, during which substantial changes occurred in terms of data
   availability. We made a thorough analysis in terms of goodness of fit
   (mean error) and bias in the first two moments (mean and variance), in
   the extreme quantiles, and in long-term trend magnitude and
   significance. We show that gap filling may result in biases in the mean
   and the variance of the reconstructed series, and also in the magnitude
   and significance of temporal trends. Introduction of a two-step bias
   correction in the gap-filling process solved some of these problems,
   although it did not allow us to produce completely unbiased trend
   estimates. Using only one (the best) neighbor and performing a one-step
   bias correction, being a simpler approach, closely rivaled this method,
   although it had similar problems with trend estimates. A trade-off must
   be assumed between goodness of fit (error minimization) and variance
   bias.},

Abstract = {The trend of temperature and homogeneity are the most significant issue
   for climate change allied research. This research aims to identify the
   long-term trend and change point detection of winter maximum (t(max)),
   minimum (t(min)) and average (t(mean)) temperature of six meteorological
   stations of North Bengal, India using 102years' time series data
   (1915-2016). To detect the monotonic trend and the rate of change,
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator were
   used. Homogeneity of winter temperature was studied using Buishand's
   range test (B test) and Pettit's test (P test). From the results, it was
   observed that most of the stations were showed significant (P<0.05)
   warming trend in winter season. The rate of increasing was highest at
   station English Bazar in the month of December. On the other hand,
   significant changed of winter t(max) and t(mean) occurred in around 1959
   and 1952 respectively, while for t(min) it was quite late, occurred in
   the year 1988. The populations of North Bengal who are dependent on
   temperature-related primary economic activities are getting benefitted
   from this study. In addition, these analyses will be helpful for
   policymakers and scientist to focus on micro-level planning and
   sustainable Rabi crops management in this region.},

Title = {Decadal surface temperature trends in India based on a new

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {A new comprehensive surface temperature data set for India is used to
   document changes in Indian temperature over seven decades, in order to
   examine the patterns and possible effects of global warming. The data
   set is subdivided into pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon categories
   in order to study the temperature patterns in each of these periods.
   When the decade means in maximum, minimum and daily mean temperature for
   the 2000s are compared to those of the 1950s, a consistent pattern of
   warming is found over northwestern and southern India, and a pattern of
   cooling is seen in a broad zone anchored over northeastern India and
   extending southwestward across central India. These patterns are
   explained by the presence of a large region of anthropogenic brown haze
   over India and adjacent ocean regions. These aerosols absorb solar
   radiation, leading to warming of the haze layer over northeastern and
   central India and to cooling of the surface air beneath. The heated air
   rises and then sinks to the north and south of the haze region over
   northwestern and southern India, warming the air by compression as it
   sinks in those regions. The possible impact of these temperature
   patterns on Indian agriculture is considered.},

Abstract = {Investigations have been carried out by climatologists to find a
   possible link of climate change with anthropogenic activities by
   studying trends in different climatic parameters, particularly surface
   air temperature of densely populated cities. The present research aimed
   at quantifying the change in surface air temperature at India's four
   most populated cities - Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai. The cities
   taken up for study have experienced rapid urbanization in the recent
   past. Therefore, the main objective of the research was to find the
   impact of urbanization on temperature trends at these cities. Trends in
   annual and seasonal temperature series were analyzed using linear trend
   and Mann-Kendall test. From the population trends Less Urbanized Period
   (LUP) and More Urbanized Period (MUP) were identified. The average
   population and surface air temperature of these two periods were used to
   further assess the urbanization effect. Most of the trends showed
   positive change in temperature with different rates in different
   seasons. In some cases, the trends showed asymmetry. For example, the
   maximum temperature at Mumbai during winter and monsoon is significantly
   increasing whereas minimum temperature shows significant decrease. On
   the other hand remaining cities recorded significant increase in minimum
   temperature during winter. The analysis based on LUP and MUP indicates
   that, on seasonal scale the difference in temperature of these two
   periods is significant for post-monsoon and winter seasons. Further the
   relationship indicates a negative change in temperature with increase in
   population. This indicates that the effect of urbanization is more
   pronounced during these seasons, as far as warming is concerned. Thus,
   an inconsistent climatic response to urbanization is observed at these
   cities.},

Abstract = {Water temperature data from the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie from 1908
   to the present were acquired. This long-term data set contains (with a
   few gaps) daily water temperatures at a constant location for the 82-yr
   period. We hypothesized that water temperatures, because of the dampened
   variability as compared to air temperatures, would provide a useful
   record of long-term temperature change. The data were analyzed for
   statistically significant trends, both annually and monthly for
   long-term and 10-yr blocks; both warming and cooling trends within all
   categories were found. The longest significant trend was a
   0.12-degrees-C per decade increase from about 1920 to 1990. This
   increase, which was statistically significant for both simple regression
   and time-series analysis, is within the limits of the suggested rates of
   change on the global scale. On the other hand, there was no significant
   trend from the beginning of the record (1908) to the present, due to an
   apparent dramatic cooling from 1908 to about 1920.},

Abstract = {Assessment of spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables and
   their forecast is essential in the context of climate change. Such
   analysis can help suggest possible solutions for flora and fauna in
   protected areas and adaptation strategies to make forests and
   communities more resilient. The present study attempts to analyze
   climate variability, trend and forecast of temperature and rainfall in
   the Valmiki Tiger Reserve, India. We utilized rainfall and temperature
   gridded data obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department during
   1981-2020. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were employed
   to examine the time series trend and magnitude of change at the annual,
   monthly and seasonal levels. Random forest machine learning algorithm
   was used to estimate seasonal prediction and forecasting of rainfall and
   temperature trend for the next ten years (2021-2030). The predictive
   capacity of the model was evaluated by statistical performance assessors
   of coefficient of correlation, mean absolute error, mean absolute
   percentage error and root mean squared error. The findings revealed a
   significant decreasing trend in rainfall and an increasing trend in
   temperature. However, a declining trend for maximum temperature has been
   observed for winter and post-monsoon seasons. The results of seasonal
   forecasting exhibited a considerable decrease in rainfall and
   temperature across the Reserve during all the seasons. However, the
   temperature will increase during the summer season. The random forest
   machine learning algorithm has shown its effectiveness in forecasting
   the temperature and rainfall variables. The findings suggest that these
   approaches may be used at various spatial scales in different
   geographical locations.},

Abstract = {We analyze historical simulations of variability in temperature and
   rainfall extremes in the twentieth century, as derived from various
   global models run informing the Fourth Assessment Report of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4). On the basis of
   three indices of climate extremes, we compare observed and modeled
   trends in time and space, including the direction and significance of
   the changes at the scale of South America south of 10 degrees S. The
   climate extremes described warm nights, heavy rainfall amounts and dry
   spells. The reliability of the GCM simulations is suggested by
   similarity between observations and simulations in the case of warm
   nights and extreme rainfall in some regions. For any specific extreme
   temperature index, minor differences appear in the spatial distribution
   of the changes across models in some regions, while substantial
   differences appear in regions in the interior of tropical and
   subtropical South America. The differences are in the relative magnitude
   of the trends. Consensus and significance are less strong when regional
   patterns are considered, with the exception of the La Plata Basin, where
   observed and simulated trends in warm nights and extreme rainfall are
   evident.},

Title = {Lagrangian detection of precipitation moisture sources for an arid
   region in northeast Greenland: relations to the North Atlantic
   Oscillation, sea ice cover, and temporal trends from 1979 to 2017},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE DYNAMICS},

Abstract = {Temperature in northeast Greenland is expected to rise at a faster rate
   than the global average as a consequence of anthropogenic climate
   change. Associated with this temperature rise, precipitation is also
   expected to increase as a result of increased evaporation from a warmer
   and ice-free Arctic Ocean. In recent years, numerous palaeoclimate
   projects have begun working in the region with the aim of improving our
   understanding of how this highly sensitive region responds to a warmer
   world. However, a lack of meteorological stations within the area makes
   it difficult to place the palaeoclimate records in the context of
   present-day climate. This study aims to improve our understanding of
   precipitation and moisture source dynamics over a small arid region
   located at 80(degrees) N in northeast Greenland. The origin of water
   vapour for precipitation over the study region is detected by a
   Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic, which is applied to reanalysis
   data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   (ERA-Interim) from 1979 to 2017. While precipitation amounts are
   relatively constant during the year, the regional moisture sources
   display a strong seasonality. The most dominant winter moisture sources
   are the North Atlantic above 45(degrees) N and the ice-free Atlantic
   sector of the Arctic Ocean, while in summer the patterns shift towards
   local and north Eurasian continental sources. During the positive phases
   of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), evaporation and moisture
   transport from the Norwegian Sea are stronger, resulting in larger and
   more variable precipitation amounts. Testing the hypothesis that
   retreating sea ice will lead to an increase in moisture supply remains
   challenging based on our data. However, we found that moisture sources
   are increasing in the case of retreating sea ice for some regions, in
   particular in October to December. Although the annual mean surface
   temperature in the study region has increased by 0.7 C-degrees per
   decade (95 \% confidence interval {[}0.4, 1.0] C-degrees per decade)
   according to ERA-Interim data, we do not detect any change in the amount
   of precipitation with the exception of autumn where precipitation
   increases by 8.2 {[}0.8, 15.5] mm per decade over the period. This
   increase is consistent with future predicted Arctic precipitation
   change. Moisture source trends for other months and regions were
   non-existent or small.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the spatio-temporal trends and variability of
   temperature and rainfall in Geshi Watershed of South Western Ethiopia.
   The available gridded daily rainfall and temperature data managed by
   Ethiopian Na-tional Meteorological Agency (NMA) for 1986-2020 was used.
   Spatial variability and temporal trends of tem-perature and rainfall
   were analyzed using XLSTAT and ArcGIS 10.8 software. The Mann-Kendall
   test was used for trend analysis. Variability analysis was also done
   using the coefficient of variation and precipitation concen-tration
   index. The study reveals constant increasing trends in rainfall; and
   insignificant and high variability but increasing trends of temperature.
   The variabilities and trends justify the spatio-temporal differences
   along different seasons (spring locally known as `belg', summer locally
   known as `kiremt', and annual). The watershed is characterized by high
   to moderate rainfall coefficient of variation, significant years of high
   concentration of rainfall, and substantial negative annual rainfall
   anomalies; that severe variability was found in the summer-season. These
   variabilities and trends, especially late onset and early cessation of
   rainfall and increase in tem-perature created favorable conditions for
   insect and disease proliferation that eventually reduces agricultural
   productivity. Household income, which is solely based on agricultural
   production, declines which in turn affects household resilience.
   Maladaptation in the form of deforestation, fuelwood and charcoal
   selling, agricultural land expansion, and practicing input-intensive
   agriculture that contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-sare taken
   as an alternative livelihood strategy. In conclusion, spatiotemporal
   variabilities and trends of rainfall and temperature affect agricultural
   productivity, reduced household resilience leading to low adaptive
   capacity, and increased GHG emissions, which are known to be major
   pillars of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). In response, area-specific
   CSA technologies such as small-scale irrigation, improved animal
   husbandry, efficient inorganic fertilizer use, using manure, crop
   residue management, using high-yielding improved crop varieties, and
   using disease-resistant varieties are recommended.},

Title = {Analyzing trend and forecasting of temperature and rainfall in Shimla
   district of Himachal Pradesh, India using non-parametric and bagging
   REPTree machine learning approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS},

Abstract = {The changing pattern of climate variables has caused extreme weather
   events and severe disasters, especially in mountainous regions. Such
   events have a detrimental impact on resources, environment and society.
   Thus, it has become imperative to examine the trends and forecasts of
   meteorological variables using a scientific modelling approach. This
   study investigates temperature and rainfall trends using the modified
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator between 1980 and 2021. A
   Bagging-REPTree machine learning model was utilized for forecasting
   temperature and rainfall trends for the next 30 years (2022-2051) to
   understand the temporal dynamics in Shimla district of the Indian
   Himalayan state. The mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute
   error, root mean squared error and correlation coefficient were
   determined to assess the effectiveness and precision of the model. The
   findings revealed that the frequency of intense rainfall in the district
   has increased during the monsoon season (June-September) from 1980 to
   2021. Significant trends were found in annual rainfall, maximum, minimum
   and mean temperatures while rainfall during the winter, summer and
   post-monsoon seasons has shown a declining trend. The forecast analysis
   revealed a significant trend for rainfall during the monsoon season and
   an increasing trend in the maximum temperature has been observed during
   the winter and summer seasons. The analysis has provided sufficient
   evidence of variability and uncertainty in the behavior of
   meteorological variables. The outcome of the study may help in devising
   suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies to combat climate change
   in hilly regions. The methodology adopted in the study may help in the
   future progression of the research in different geographical regions for
   trend and climate forecasting.},

Title = {Analysis of variations and trends of temperature over Niger central
   hydrological area, Nigeria, 1911-2015},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {131},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adequate information about the variations and trends of climatic
   variables is indispensable for the better management of the water
   resources and agricultural sectors. In this study, the variability and
   trends of the monthly, seasonal and annual temperatures ((TMIN, TMAX and
   TMEAN) time series were studied over Niger Central Hydrological Area,
   Nigeria (NCHA) during 1911-2015 using the Climate Research Unit (CRU)
   data. Different statistical operations analysis comprising descriptive
   statistics, linear regression model, Mann-Kendall test, Pettitt's test
   and standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT) were employed for the
   analysis. The tests were used to examine the temperature variability,
   presence of monotonic trends and change points of the time series. The
   monthly TMEAN variability over the entire area was between 2.10\% and
   3.61\%. Periods 1914-1925 and 1974-1980 showed cooling trends, while
   1930-1935, 1981-1988 and 2001-2015 exhibited warming trends. The annual
   TMIN and TMEAN showed positive trends across the 33 sub-basins of NCHA,
   while the TMAX showed mixed trends. The increasing trend was most
   significant on the monthly, seasonal and annual timescales of the TMIN,
   followed by TMEAN. In contrast, the mixed trends in TMAX were not
   significant. The global rate of change trends of TMIN, TMAX and TMEAN
   are 0.091, -0.007 and 0.043 degrees C/decade respectively. The overall
   warming of TMEAN also had a significant upward shift change of 0.43
   degrees C since 1980 and the change spatially is characterized by a
   SW-NE orientation. There is a need to embrace green settlement and a
   green economy to reduce the impact of the ever-increasing warming trend
   over the region.},

Volume = {47},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Extreme temperature events and their long-term variability are
   investigated using daily air temperature data from Murmansk weather
   station for the period of 1942-2018. It was found that the variability
   of extremely warm and cold events in Murmansk in winter is mainly
   explained rather by the dynamics of storm tracks than by the local
   processes of air mass transformation in the region. It is shown that the
   main characteristics of extreme events demonstrate a clearly pronounced
   seasonality. It was revealed that the positive trend in seasonal mean
   temperatures is mainly due to the reduced number of extremely cold
   events in Murmansk. The study shows that the leading factor determining
   the variability of extreme events is the Arctic Oscillation (AO). In
   turn, the AO anomalies are formed as a result of the dynamic
   stratosphere-troposphere coupling, which is expressed in the response of
   storm tracks to sudden stratospheric warmings.},

Abstract = {The recent increasing trend of ``warm Arctic, cold continents{''} has
   attracted much attention, but it remains debatable as to what forces are
   behind this phenomenon. Here, we revisited surface temperature
   variability over the Arctic and the Eurasian continent by applying the
   self-organizing-map (SOM) technique to gridded daily surface temperature
   data. Nearly 40 \% of the surface temperature trends are explained by
   the nine SOM patterns that depict the switch to the current warm
   Arctic-cold Eurasia pattern at the beginning of this century from the
   reversed pattern that dominated the 1980s and 1990s. Further, no
   cause-effect relationship is found between the Arctic sea ice loss and
   the cold spells in the high-latitude to midlatitude Eurasian continent
   suggested by earlier studies. Instead, the increasing trend in warm
   Arctic-cold Eurasia pattern appears to be related to the anomalous
   atmospheric circulations associated with two Rossby wave trains
   triggered by rising sea surface temperature (SST) over the central North
   Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans. On interdecadal timescale, the
   recent increase in the occurrences of the warm Arctic-cold Eurasia
   pattern is a fragment of the interdecadal variability of SST over the
   Atlantic Ocean as represented by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
   (AMO) and over the central Pacific Ocean.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {This study describes the temperature and temperature variability trend
   accompanied with introducing modern building insulation standards in
   Germany, ranging from classical buildings before 1978 to EnEV-2009 and
   passive house standards (PAH). Data sets comprise far about 10 million
   field measurements covering room temperatures and manual ventilation
   activities as well as an exemplary case study within six modern
   EnEV-2009 buildings. We find winter indoor temperatures increased by 4
   K, from initially 18 degrees C in buildings built prior to 1978 up to
   about 22 degrees C within passive houses and modern EnEV-2009 standard,
   and, at the same time, room temperatures become more homogenous while
   the lower temperatures are almost vanishing. Furthermore, almost 10 \%
   of the windows are kept open even during the mid-winter heating season.
   We argue that modern buildings experience frequent, unexpected and
   unrequested inner energy gains and subsequently larger heat storing
   effects during the entire season, which lead to discomfort and a reflex
   to open windows. The ``bio-feedback{''} of residents changes: they may
   quickly feel a sense of ``overheating{''}, but practically never more
   experience freezing events. Additional research in interdisciplinary
   best practice labs, aiming at an enhanced understanding of individual
   feelings of thermal comfort and the development of adapted assisting
   systems, is recommended. This study emphasizes, that enforced
   application of building standards beyond EnEV-2002 appears questionable,
   as long as physiological wellness in modern living environment does not
   harmonize with technical concepts of energy use optimization and should
   only be introduced on a voluntary basis.},

Abstract = {Laser is widely applied in military and medicine fields because of its
   excellent capability. In order to effectively defend excess damage by
   laser, the thermal processing theory of skin tissue generated by laser
   should be carried out. The heating rate and thermal damage area should
   be studied. The mathematics model of bio-tissue heat transfer that is
   irradiated by laser is analyzed. And boundary conditions of bio-tissue
   are discussed. Three layer FEM grid model of bio-tissue is established.
   The temperature rising inducing by pulse laser in the tissue is modeled
   numerically by adopting ANSYS software. The changing trend of
   temperature in the tissue is imitated and studied under the conditions
   of different exposure dose pulse laser. The results show that
   temperature rising in the tissue depends on the parameters of pulse
   laser largely. In the same conditions, the pulse width of laser is
   smaller and its instant power is higher. And temperature rising effect
   in the tissue is very clear. On the contrary, temperature rising effect
   in the tissue is lower. The cooling time inducing by temperature rising
   effect in the tissue is longer along with pulse separation of laser is
   bigger. And the temperature difference is bigger in the pulse period.},

Journal = {INLAND WATERS},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The timing and duration of lake ice cover is a critical driver of lake
   ecosystem dynamics and an important indicator of climatic change. While
   much research has focused on lake ice dynamics at high latitudes and in
   north-temperate lakes, few studies have considered ice dynamics in lakes
   at lower latitudes. Here we use high-resolution satellite imagery to
   determine patterns of lake ice cover for 128 Sand Hill lakes from 2016
   to 2023. Average ice duration was 112 days and varied between 74 and 158
   days. The average dates for ice-on and ice-off were 25 November and 17
   March. Ice cover duration for Sand Hill lakes was long compared to lakes
   at higher latitudes. October-November-December and February-March-April
   mean atmospheric temperatures were strong drivers of lake ice cover
   compared to lake-specific factors (e.g., lake area, shoreline
   complexity). To our knowledge, this represents the first study of lake
   ice cover in Nebraska Sand Hills and provides baseline data to help
   determine the effect of climatic changes on lake ecosystems in the
   Nebraska Sand Hills.},

Title = {Estimation of the Dependence of Ice Phenomena Trends on Air and Water
   Temperature in River},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The identification of changes in the ice phenomena (IP) in rivers is a
   significant element of analyses of hydrological regime features, of the
   risk of occurrence of ice jam floods, and of the ecological effects of
   river icing (RI). The research here conducted aimed to estimate the
   temporal and spatial changes in the IP in a lowland river in the
   temperate climate (the Notec River, Poland, Central Europe), depending
   on air temperature (TA) and water temperature (TW) during the
   multi-annual period of 1987-2013. Analyses were performed of IP change
   trends in three RI phases: freezing, when there appears stranded ice
   (SI), frazil ice (FI), or stranded ice with frazil ice (SI-FI); the
   phase of stable ice cover (IC) and floating ice (FoI); and the phase of
   stranded ice with floating ice (SI-FoI), frazil ice with floating ice
   (FI-FoI), and ice jams (IJs). Estimation of changes in IP in connection
   with TA and TW made use of the regression model for count data with a
   negative binomial distribution and of the zero-inflated negative
   binomial model. The analysis of the multi-annual change tendency of TA
   and TW utilized a non-parametric Mann-Kendall test for detecting
   monotonic trends with Yue-Pilon correction (MK-YP). Between two and
   seven types of IP were registered at individual water gauges, while
   differences were simultaneously demonstrated in their change trends over
   the researched period. The use of the Vuong test confirmed the greater
   effectiveness of estimates for the zero-inflated model than for the
   temporal trend model, thanks to which an increase in the probability of
   occurrence of the SI phenomenon in the immediate future was determined;
   this, together with FI, was found to be the most frequently occurring IP
   in rivers in the temperate climate. The models confirmed that TA is the
   best estimator for the evaluation of trends of the occurrence of IC. It
   was shown that the predictive strength of models increases when thermal
   conditions are taken into consideration, but it is not always
   statistically significant. In all probability, this points to the impact
   of local factors (changes in bed and valley morphology and anthropogenic
   pressure) that are active regardless of thermal conditions and modify
   the features of the thermal-ice regime of rivers at specific spatial
   locations. The results of research confirm the effectiveness of
   compilating a few models for the estimation of the dependence of IP
   trends on air and water temperature in a river.},

Title = {Recent trends in the UTLS temperature and tropical tropopause parameters
   over tropical South Indian region},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {197},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (UTLS) region plays an
   important role in the climate system. Quantifying the processes that
   control UTLS represents a crucial task. We assess UTLS trends and
   associated tropopause parameters (Cold Point Tropopause
   temperature/altitude (CPT/CPH), Lapse Rate Tropopause
   temperature/altitude (LRT/LRH), Convective outflow level
   temperature/altitude (COT/COH) and Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL)
   thickness). This study is based on high-resolution daily radiosonde data
   from 2006 to 2018 over a tropical station Gadanki in south India
   supported by satellite measurements. The results show an increase of CPH
   (LRH) of similar to 0.06 km (similar to 0.10 km), decrease of CPT (LRT)
   of similar to 1.09 K (1.16 K), increase of COH of similar to 0.29 km and
   decrease of TTL thickness of similar to 0.23 km in the recent decade.
   The vertical temperature trends show a strong cooling trend at lower
   stratosphere (17-19 km) with a maximum cooling rate of 1.3 +/- 0.86 K
   per decade at 19.4 km altitude unlike reported recently using global
   radiosonde network. A warming trend is observed in the entire
   troposphere (0-15 km) with maximum warming rate of 0.44 +/- 0.55 K at
   11.6 km during the last decade. Distinct variability in the temperature
   is noticed below and above the tropopause with the strong seasonal
   change above the tropical tropopause (18 and 19 km) compared to the
   below the tropopause (15-17 km). The observed trends are explained in
   relation to the ozone (O-3) and water vapor (WV) trends over Gadanki.
   Compare to the ozone changes, the WV increasing trend was found strongly
   influencing the LS cooling trend in the recent decade over Indian
   monsoon region.},

   in North China than in South China. Seasonal trends of DVTTmean are also
   negative in NEC, except in summer. For DVTTmax, trends are generally
   more obvious than DVTTmin in all seasons in NEC; moreover, trends in
   spring are obvious in both the north and the south, but trends in summer

Abstract = {Generating credible climate change and extremes projections remains a
   high-priority challenge, especially since recent observed emissions are
   above the worst-case scenario. Bias and uncertainty analyses of ensemble
   simulations from a global earth systems model show increased warming and
   more intense heat waves combined with greater uncertainty and large
   regional variability in the 21st century. Global warming trends are
   statistically validated across ensembles and investigated at regional
   scales. Observed heat wave intensities in the current decade are larger
   than worst-case projections. Model projections are relatively
   insensitive to initial conditions, while uncertainty bounds obtained by
   comparison with recent observations are wider than ensemble ranges.
   Increased trends in temperature and heat waves, concurrent with larger
   uncertainty and variability, suggest greater urgency and complexity of
   adaptation or mitigation decisions.},

Title = {TEMPERATURE HF FUGACITY TRENDS DURING CRYSTALLIZATION OF CALCITE
   CARBONATITE MAGMA IN THE FEN COMPLEX, NORWAY},

Abstract = {Calcite carbonatite (sovite), associated apatite cumulates and contact
   metasomatic phlogopite-rocks in the Fen complex (S. Norway) contain
   coexisting apatite and phlogopite.  Two distinct compositional groups
   are recognized: fluorapatite (X(F) = 0.5-0.8) coexists with
   hydroxy-phlogopite with X(F) = 0.11-0.26, whereas hydroxyapatite (X(F) =
   0.34-0.44) coexists with low-F hydroxy-phlogopite (X(F) almost-equal-to
   0.03).  Apatite-biotite geothermometry suggests that the minerals
   equilibrated at igneous temperatures (less than 1200 to ca.
   625-degrees-C), and were not significantly disturbed by late
   low-temperature re-equilibration.  This, combined with HF-barometry
   based on apatite-fluid and phlogopite-fluid F-OH exchange equilibria,
   makes it possible to recognize two crystallization trends at different
   levels of hydrogen fluoride fugacity.  The existence of such trends
   reflects internal buffering of the HF fugacity by apatite and/or
   phlogopite.  The recorded differences in HF fugacity suggest that two or
   more independent or semi-independent lines of magmatic descent gave rise
   to calcite carbonatite magma in the Fen complex.  Combined
   apatite-phlogopite geothermometry and hydrogen fluoride barometry is a
   useful tool enabling us to see through post-magmatic alteration of
   carbonatites, and to establish primary magmatic controls even in cases
   where carbonate and iron-titanium oxide minerals have re-equilibrated at
   much lower temperatures.},

Abstract = {Variations in the climate constitute a significant threat to the
   productivity of food crops in the Gambia. A good understanding of the
   influence of climate variability on crop production is vital for climate
   resilience and improved food security. This study examined the trends,
   relationships, and the extent to which growing season temperatures and
   the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index)
   impacted sorghum, millet, maize, and rice yields in three
   agro-ecological regions of the Gambia during 1990-2019. Mean
   temperatures and the SPEI exhibited increasing trends while observed
   yields showed a decline across all regions. The SPEI had a significant
   positive relationship with yields, and temperatures were negatively
   associated with yields. Though yield response to climate variability
   differs among regions, 20\% to 62\% of variations in the four crop
   yields were due to climate trends. The combined effect of the SPEI and
   temperatures decreased yields from 3.6 kg ha(-1) year(-1) to 29.4 kg
   ha(-1) year(-1), with the most severe decline observed in rice and maize
   yields in the Sahelian zone. Although uncertainties might arise from not
   considering related extreme climate events, this study highlights how
   past climate trends affect cereal yields in the Gambia; thus, any
   unfavorable change in the local climate could have severe repercussions
   on the country's food security. There is a need for concerted efforts to
   increase investments in adaptation strategies to lessen the effects of
   the climate for improved crop productivity.},

Abstract = {With surging population and changing global climate, the prospect of
   ensuring global food security has become ever challenging. Crop yield is
   driven by various environmental and management factors. For exaple, crop
   yield is related to the temperature during the growth stages of the
   plants, and therefore, the yield is going to be affected by any changes
   in temperature pattern. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the
   salient features of the temperature in the recent past, which marks the
   advent of the anthropogenic climate change and in the upcoming future as
   well. This study analyzes the trend in various parameters of temperature
   in Illinois at an annual and seasonal scale. It also analyzes the
   temperature at a temporal scale relevant to the crop yield. It was
   observed that the effects of climate change on Illinois temperature is
   very low and sparsely distributed. Any change observed heretofore point
   towards a favorable ambient condition for the cropping systems. The
   climate change is expected to affect both natural and man-man systems in
   the future. Agricultural practices combine significant components of
   both of these systems. For rain-fed agricultural systems, whose
   dependence outweighs towards the natural determinants, climate change
   adds another layer of uncertainty that hinders the planning and
   management process.},

Title = {Eutrophication, recovery and temperature in Lake Mjosa: detecting trends

Abstract = {1. How climate warming may interact with other pressures on aquatic
   ecosystems is an important issue for research and management. We
   combined lake monitoring data with a palaeolimnological study to explore
   the combined effects of eutrophication and subsequent oligotrophication
   with a long-term temperature increase in epilimnetic waters. Our goals
   were (i) to evaluate how well sediment-based reconstructions reflect the
   instrumental observations, (ii) to use the palaeo-record to characterise
   a reference state for the lake and (iii) to explore whether data from
   the sediment record can aid in separating the effects of nutrient load
   and temperature in a large and deep lake. 2. Lake Mjosa is a large and
   deep lake in south-eastern Norway. Eutrophication symptoms peaked in the
   1970s, which led to extensive measures to reduce the phosphorus load. A
   monitoring programme has run continuously from 1972. Monitoring has
   documented a marked decrease in phosphorus load and algal biomass and
   also revealed an increase in epilimnetic temperature and extended summer
   stratification. 3. Records of algal pigments and diatoms were extracted
   from sediment cores taken from 236 m depth. The pigment record
   documented dramatic changes in lake production consistent with the
   monitoring record. The diatom record reflected well the eutrophication
   history of the lake and also demonstrated that the assemblage of the
   recent recovery stage differs from that of the pre-eutrophication
   period. 4. Ordination of diatom assemblages over time constrained by
   proxies for nutrient load and temperature indicated that the diatom
   assemblage correlated with both factors, which together accounted for
   60\% of the variation in diatom composition. No interaction was detected
   between these factors. The results suggest that the diatom assemblage
   has responded to varying nutrient loads as well as to changes in
   temperature and/or factors that correlate with temperature. 5.
   Reconstructions of algal biomass and total phosphorus content mirrored
   known changes through the monitoring period, although the absolute
   phosphorus estimates were too high relative to the instrumental record.
   The sediment record from Lake Mjosa provides a baseline for lake
   production in terms of algal pigments and organic contents, and for the
   diatom assemblage composition in a pristine stage.},

Abstract = {Understanding trends in any atmospheric quantity typically requires the
   ability to distinguish between naturally occurring processes that result
   in trends, such as the 11 year solar cycle, and potential anthropogenic
   secular trends that occur simultaneously. After the review of
   mesospheric and lower thermospheric temperature response to solar
   activity by Beig et al. (2008), a few new results along with some
   modified results by revisiting the older data sets have been reported
   recently. Main improvement is due to the length of data series and
   amount of data which have been accounted in recent years. This article
   summarizes the progress made in the field of temperature variability due
   to changing solar activity as reported recently. Recent investigations
   revealed that the solar signal becomes stronger with increasing latitude
   in the mesosphere. Temperature response to solar activity at the lower
   part of mesopause region is around a few degrees per 100 solar flux
   units (sfu), which becomes stronger (4-5 K/100 sfu) in the upper part of
   this region in both hemispheres. The overall global picture indicates
   that the solar signal in the mesopause region temperature in the
   Northern Hemisphere is relatively stronger in recent time in a majority
   of locations compared to results reported in earlier reviews.},

Abstract = {Temperatures obtained from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband
   Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on board the Thermosphere
   Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) satellite during the
   period from 2003 to 2019 are analysed to obtain trends in the region
   from 50 degrees S to 50 degrees N using the method of Empirical Mode
   Decomposition (EMD). This method is used to remove long-term
   oscillations from the data to accurately estimate the linear trends. The
   novelty of the current study is in dividing the entire study region into
   sub-regions of 5 degrees latitude and 10 degrees longitude to
   investigate the associated longitudinal variability. The study shows
   that the global middle atmosphere, including the global mesopause and
   stratopause, is cooling as a whole. In the stratosphere and lower
   mesosphere the observed trends are -0.5 K/decade and in the upper
   mesosphere, the trends increase to -1.0 K/decade. Mesopause temperatures
   in Southern Hemisphere and stratopause temperatures in Northern
   Hemisphere are showing stronger cooling trends in comparison to the
   other hemisphere. Over tropical and subtropical regions, Southern
   Hemisphere mesopause is showing a stronger cooling trend over Indian
   Ocean and Asian region while the cooling trends are symmetric around the
   equator over Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Two important results obtained
   in the present study are as follows: (1) A warming trend, reaching 2.5
   K/decade, is observed around 77 km over the Equator and adjoining
   tropical latitudes, which is attributed to processes leading to the
   mesospheric semiannual oscillation (MSAO). (2) Anomalous cooling is
   observed in the stratopause region over the Southern Indian Ocean (SIO)
   longitudes. Temperature trends are large and negative ranging from -1 to
   -2 K/decade over SIO while the trends over the Southern Pacific Ocean
   (SPO) and the Southern Atlantic Ocean (SAO) lying in the same
   latitudinal band are small and positive, reaching values of 1 K/decade.
   It is envisaged that the recent accelerated warming of the SIO is
   probably responsible for the cooling of the stratopause region above.

Abstract = {Temperature trends in the middle and upper stratosphere are evaluated
   using measurements from the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU), combined
   with data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Sounding of the
   Atmosphere Using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instruments. Data
   from MLS and SABER are vertically integrated to approximate the SSU
   weighting functions and combined with SSU to provide a data record
   spanning 1979-2015. Vertical integrals are calculated using empirically
   derived Gaussian weighting functions, which provide improved agreement
   with high-latitude SSU measurements compared to previously derived
   weighting functions. These merged SSU data are used to evaluate
   decadal-scale trends, solar cycle variations, and volcanic effects from
   the lower to the upper stratosphere. Episodic warming is observed
   following the volcanic eruptions of El Chichon (1982) and Mt. Pinatubo
   (1991), focused in the tropics in the lower stratosphere and in high
   latitudes in the middle and upper stratosphere. Solar cycle variations
   are centered in the tropics, increasing in amplitude from the lower to
   the upper stratosphere. Linear trends over 1979-2015 show that cooling
   increases with altitude from the lower stratosphere (from similar to-0.1
   to -0.2 K decade (1)) to the middle and upper stratosphere (from;
   similar to-0.5 to -0.6 K decade (1)). Cooling in the middle and upper
   stratosphere is relatively uniform in latitudes north of about 30
   degrees S, but trends decrease to near zero over the Antarctic. Mid-and
   upper-stratospheric temperatures show larger cooling over the first half
   of the data record (1979-97) compared to the second half (1998-2015),
   reflecting differences in upper-stratospheric ozone trends between these
   periods.},

Abstract = {Different statistical procedures like t-test, regression models, the

   standardised anomaly were used to find the most appropriate expression
   of the annual mean global solar radiation (GSR) and temperature
   interannual evolution for the period 1921 to 2009. In order to sustain
   the results from Cluj-Napoca, we also used data of 2 neighbouring
   stations, namely Bistrita and Sibiu. The parametric analysis with
   regression models shows significant increasing trends, the quadratic
   trend model providing a better fit than the linear and exponential
   models. According to the quadratic model, the GSR increased at all 3
   stations, while the temperature increased at Cluj-Napoca and Bistria and
   decreased at Sibiu. It is the most probably that this increasing in GSR
   and increasing/decreasing of temperature is rather the ascensional or
   descensional parts of some natural micro-oscillations due to the natural
   climate variability or solar variations.},

Abstract = {A time series spatial grid of sea surface temperature (SST) data
   provided by the archives of Meteo-France and covering the period
   1972-1993 was analysed in order to define both the long-term and
   periodic (mainly seasonal) components at different locations in the Bay
   of Biscay. The study confirmed the existence of a long-term increasing
   trend in the SST, but showed that this trend was not homogeneous over
   the entire area. It revealed also that the amplitude of the cyclic
   components (summer-winter differences) is spatially heterogeneous. The
   south-eastern part of the Bay of Biscay, close to the French-Spanish
   border, shows the stronger warming trend (a mean increase of 1.4 degrees
   C for the period 1972-1993). This trend decreases in the adjacent
   regions and is not statistically significant in the northern part of the
   bay and the Celtic Sea. The increasing trend was recorded both in winter
   and summer periods with the winter slopes being slightly higher. The
   amplitude of the SST seasonal changes (summer-winter differences) is
   stronger close to the southern French Atlantic coast in the area off the
   Gironde estuary. The lowest values were observed in the SW of the bay in
   the region of intense upwelling processes. Finally, the analysis of the
   main components of this series provides a simple empirical model
   describing the time-related changes in the SST. This model could be
   useful for studies in the field of biological oceanography and in the
   context of comparative studies. The possible linkage of these
   observations with changes in the structure of ecosystem in this area is
   also discussed. (C) Elsevier, Paris.},

   Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {The reasons for large discrepancies between observations and
   simulations, as well as for uncertainties in projections of the
   equatorial Pacific zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, are
   controversial. We used CMIP6 models and large ensemble simulations to
   show that model bias and internal variabilities affected, i.e.,
   strengthened, the SST gradient between 1981 and 2010. The
   underestimation of strengthened trends in the southeast trade wind belt,
   the insufficient cooling effect of eastern Pacific upwelling, and the
   excessive westward extension of the climatological cold tongue in models
   jointly caused a weaker SST gradient than the recent observations. The
   phase transformation of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) could
   explain similar to 51\% of the observed SST gradient strengthening.
   After adjusting the random IPO phase to the observed IPO change, the
   adjusted SST gradient trends were closer to observations. We further
   constrained the projection of SST gradient change by using climate
   models' ability to reproduce the historical SST gradient intensification
   or the phase of the IPO. These models suggest a weakened SST gradient in
   the middle of the twenty-first century.},

Title = {Long-term trends in herring growth primarily linked to temperature by
   gradient boosting regression trees},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Environmental change and fishing activity can produce directional trends
   in exploited fish populations with consequences for stock productivity.
   For herring in the Celtic Sea, size at age has been in steady decline
   since the mid 1980's. In the neighbouring herring stock off the
   Northwest coast of Ireland, reductions in size at age are noted after
   1990. Here, gradient boosting regression trees were used to investigate
   trends in extended time series (1959-2012) of length-at-age across both
   populations and to identify important variables associated with the
   observed declines in size. The predominant signal detected was a
   non-linear negative relationship between adult size and mean Sea Surface
   Temperature during the first growing season. Herring length was
   negatively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Weaker
   associations with indicators of food availability and population size
   were also detected. Across both populations a marked decline in length
   was observed at the upper end of the temperature range (similar to 14
   degrees C in the Celtic Sea and similar to 13 degrees C in the
   Northwest). Declines in length and associations with temperature were
   more pronounced in the Celtic Sea population which may be vulnerable to
   increasing sea temperatures due to its position at the southern limit of
   the species distribution.},

Title = {Changing Trends and Abrupt Features of Extreme Temperature in Mainland

Abstract = {Studies based on the 10th (90th) percentiles as thresholds have been
   presented to assess moderate extremes in China and globally. However,
   there has been notably little research on the occurrences of high
   extremes of warm days and hot days (TX95p and TX99p) and cold nights and
   very cold nights (TN05p and TN01p), based on the 95th and 99th (5th and
   1st) percentiles of the daily maximum (minimum) temperature data at a
   certain station in the period 1971-2000, which have more direct impacts
   on society and the ecosystem. The trends analyses of cool nights or warm
   days are based upon the hypothesis that expects a linear trend and no
   abrupt change. However, abrupt changes in the climate, especially in
   extreme temperatures, have been pointed to as a major threat to
   ecosystem services. This study demonstrates that (1) the mean
   frequencies of TX95p and TX99p increased by 1.80 day/10 year and 0.62
   day/10 year, respectively, and that those of TN05p and TN01p decreased
   by 3.18 day/10 year and 1.01 day/10 year, respectively, in mainland
   China. Additionally, the TX95p and TX99p increased significantly by
   50.42\% and 58.21\%, respectively, while the TN05p and TN01p of all of
   the stations decreased significantly by 83.76\% and 76.48\%,
   respectively. Finally, (2) the TX95p and TX99p trends underwent abrupt
   changes in the 1990s or 2000s, but the trends of TN05p and TN01p
   experienced abrupt changes in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After the
   abrupt change points, the trend of warm and hot days increased more
   rapidly than before in most regions, but the trend of cold days and very
   cold days decreased more slowly than before in most regions, which
   indicates a greater risk of heat waves in the future.},

Abstract = {Neutral temperatures at 90aEuro-km height above Tromso, Norway, have
   been determined using ambipolar diffusion coefficients calculated from
   meteor echo fading times using the Nippon/Norway Tromso Meteor Radar
   (NTMR). Daily temperature averages have been calculated from November
   2003 to October 2014 and calibrated against temperature measurements
   from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board Aura. Large-scale
   periodic oscillations ranging from similar to aEuro-9 days to a year
   were found in the data using Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis, and
   these components were used to seasonally detrend the daily temperature
   values before assessing trends. Harmonic oscillations found are
   associated with the large-scale circulation in the middle atmosphere
   together with planetary and gravity wave activity. The overall
   temperature change from 2003 to 2014 is -2.2aEuro-KaEuro-+/-
   aEuro-1.0aEuro-KaEuro-decade(-1), while in summer (May-June-July) and
   winter (November-December-January) the change is -0.3 KaEuro-+/-
   aEuro-3.1aEuro-KaEuro-decade(-1) and -11.6aEuro-KaEuro-+/-
   aEuro-4.1aEuro-KaEuro-decade(-1), respectively. The temperature record
   is at this point too short for incorporating a response to solar
   variability in the trend. How well suited a meteor radar is for
   estimating neutral temperatures at 90aEuro-km using meteor trail echoes
   is discussed, and physical explanations behind a cooling trend are
   proposed.},

Title = {Heat content and temperature trends in the Mediterranean Sea as derived
   from Argo float data},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea is very sensitive to climatic changes due to its
   semi-enclosed nature and is therefore defined as one of the hotspots in
   future climate change projections. In this study, we use Argo float data
   to assess climatologies and trends in temperature and Ocean Heat Content
   (OHC) throughout the Mediterranean Sea and for specific sub-basins (e.g.
   Western and Eastern Mediterranean, Gulf of Lion, South Adriatic). The
   amount of the OHC, spatially averaged in bins of 1 degrees x1 degrees
   over the period from 2001 to 2020, increases from west to east in the
   Mediterranean Sea. Time series of temperature and OHC from 2005 to 2020,
   estimated in the surface and intermediate layers (5-700 m) and deeper
   layer (700-2000 m), reveal significant warming trends and an increase of
   OHC. The upper 700 m of the Mediterranean Sea show a temperature trend
   of 0.041 +/- 0.012 degrees C center dot yr-1, corresponding to an annual
   increase in OHC of 3.59 +/- 1.02 W center dot m-2. The Western
   Mediterranean Sea (5-700 m) is warming fastest with an increase in
   temperature at a rate of 0.070 +/- 0.015 degrees C center dot yr-1,
   corresponding to a yearly increase in OHC of 5.72 +/- 1.28 W center dot
   m-2. Mixing and convection events within convection sites and along
   boundary currents transport and disperse the temperature and OHC
   changes. Significant warming trends are evident in the deeper layers
   (700-2000 m) of the two deep convection sites in the Mediterranean Sea
   (Gulf of Lion, South Adriatic), with an exceptionally strong warming
   trend in the South Adriatic from 2013 to 2020 of 0.058 +/- 0.005 degrees
   C center dot yr-1, corresponding to a yearly increase in OHC of 9.43 +/-
   0.85 W center dot m-2. The warming of the different water masses will
   show its feedback on ocean dynamics and air-sea fluxes in the next
   years, decades, and even centuries as these warming waters spread or
   re-emerge. This will provide more energy to the atmosphere, resulting in
   more extreme weather events and will also stress ecosystems and
   accelerate the extinction of several marine species. This study
   contributes to a better understanding of climate change in the
   Mediterranean region, and should act as another wake-up call for policy
   makers and society.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Environmental change and fishing activity can produce directional trends
   in exploited fish populations with consequences for stock productivity.
   For herring in the Celtic Sea, size at age has been in steady decline
   since the mid 1980's. In the neighbouring herring stock off the
   Northwest coast of Ireland, reductions in size at age are noted after
   1990. Here, gradient boosting regression trees were used to investigate
   trends in extended time series (1959-2012) of length-at-age across both
   populations and to identify important variables associated with the
   observed declines in size. The predominant signal detected was a
   non-linear negative relationship between adult size and mean Sea Surface
   Temperature during the first growing season. Herring length was
   negatively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Weaker
   associations with indicators of food availability and population size
   were also detected. Across both populations a marked decline in length
   was observed at the upper end of the temperature range (similar to 14
   degrees C in the Celtic Sea and similar to 13 degrees C in the
   Northwest). Declines in length and associations with temperature were
   more pronounced in the Celtic Sea population which may be vulnerable to
   increasing sea temperatures due to its position at the southern limit of
   the species distribution.},

Title = {Trends in sea surface temperature and air-sea heat fluxes over the South

Abstract = {The understanding of latent and sensible heat fluxes (LHF and SHF,
   respectively) is essential to improve our knowledge on how the
   atmosphere and oceans interact. In this work we identified trends of LHF
   and SHF in the South Atlantic (SA) Ocean from 1982 to 2015 and evaluated
   the potential drivers that contribute to those trends. Based on the
   Objectively Analyzed air-sea Fluxes (OAFlux) dataset, the European
   Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ERA-Interim) and the Optimum
   Interpolation sea surface temperature (SST) Analysis Version 2 we
   analyze trends and interannual variability of seasonal heat fluxes and
   variables influencing them. Heat fluxes trends in the SA have a strong
   regional and seasonal dependence. The highest increase of heat fluxes is
   found over the region delimited to the West and to the South by the
   Brazil Current Front (referred to as the Extended Brazil Current Region;
   ExtBCR).The humidity (temperature) differences and -U10m in the ExtBCR
   only contributed to explain trends of LHF (SHF) in winter. Other
   mechanisms should be considered to explain the LHF and SHF trend
   observed in summer and in the rest of the SA. The close correspondence
   found between the trends in temperature and humidity differences and the
   trend in SST, indicates that the largest driver of trends in heat fluxes
   over the ExtBCR are the SST trends. We argue that the expansion and
   intensification of the South Atlantic Subtropical High causes an
   increase of wind speed which intensifies the western boundary current,
   leading to an increase of SST and therefore an intensification of heat
   fluxes.},

Abstract = {The diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) is an essential component of modern
   vehicle emissions control systems. The pervasive challenge for low
   temperature oxidation of engine exhaust gas is the mutual inhibition
   between the various pollutants, causing a marked increase in light-off
   temperature. Using a combination of density functional theory and
   descriptor-based microkinetic modeling, we have screened catalysts for
   low temperature co-oxidation of CO and NO with specific emphasis on
   minimizing inhibition effects. Compared to standard Pt-Pd alloys, we
   find that coinage metal alloys, i.e., Cu, Ag, and Au with at least one
   oxophilic constituent, should possess more robust low temperature
   activity with minimal inhibition. We attribute this remarkable
   performance to high surface concentrations of oxygen due to the
   oxophilic component and less competitive adsorption between CO and NO to
   the exposed coinage metal sites. We believe that these fundamental
   insights provide valuable design principles for improved low temperature
   oxidation catalysts.},

Title = {A reassessment of temperature variations and trends from global
   reanalyses and monthly surface climatological datasets},

Abstract = {The ERA-Interim and JRA-55 reanalyses of synoptic data and several
   conventional analyses of monthly climatological data provide similar
   estimates of global-mean surface warming since 1979. They broadly agree
   on the character of interannual variability and the extremity of the
   2015/2016 warm spell to which a strong El Nino and low Arctic sea-ice
   cover contribute. Nevertheless global and regional averages differ on
   various time-scales due to differences in data coverage and sea-surface
   temperature analyses; averages from those conventional datasets that
   infill where they lack direct observations agree better with the
   averages from the reanalyses. The latest warm event is less extreme when
   viewed in terms of atmospheric energy, which gives more weight to
   variability in the Tropics, where the thermal signal has greater
   vertical penetration and latent energy is a larger factor.
   Surface warming from 1998 to 2012 is larger than indicated by earlier
   versions of the conventional datasets used to characterize what the
   Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   termed a hiatus in global warming. None of the datasets exhibit net
   warming over the Antarctic since 1979.
   Centennial trends from the conventional datasets, HadCRUT4 on the one
   hand and GISTEMP and NOAAGlobalTemp on the other, differ mainly because
   sea-surface temperatures differ. Infilling of values where direct
   observations are lacking is more questionable for the data-sparse
   earlier decades. Change since the eighteenth century is inevitably more
   uncertain than change over and after a modern baseline period. The
   latter is arguably best estimated separately for taking stock of actions
   to limit climate change, exploiting reanalyses and using satellite data
   to refine the conventional approach. Nevertheless, early in 2016 the
   global temperature appears to have first touched or briefly breached a
   level 1.5 degrees C above that early in the Industrial Revolution,
   having touched the 1.0 degrees C level in 1998 during a previous El
   Nino.},

Abstract = {Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is an emerging signal processing
   techniques that has found many applications. EMD decomposes a
   one-dimensional (1D) signal into hierarchical components known as
   intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue, based on the local
   properties of the signal. The first IMF depicts the highest local
   oscillations, while the residue depicts the trend of a signal/data.
   Application of interpolation methods causes huge computation time and
   other artifacts, which limits the use of EMD for many real life signals.
   This paper introduces a pseudo EMD (P-EMD) method that replaces the
   interpolation step by direct envelope estimation using order statistics
   filters to overcome several difficulties. The P-EMD method is utilized
   to determine and analyze the trend of various signals including sea
   level pressure and sea surface temperature.},

Pages = {91-103},
Abstract = {The Earth's climate system has recently experienced substantial warming,
   and associated effects are often most pronounced at species-specific
   distribution limits. Treeline ecotones may therefore be particularly
   useful to assess the complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors in
   relation to environmental change. Here, we present site-dependent growth
   trends and climate responses of 22 Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) H.
   Karst. tree-ring chronologies from the treeline ecotone in the Sudetes
   Mountains (Mts.) along the Czech-Polish border. Annually resolved and
   absolutely dated ring-width measurements from 2 regions (Giant Mts. and
   Hruby Jesenik Mts.), separated by aspect and altitude, resulted in
   robust chronologies for the 20th century. All sites reveal a close
   relationship between ring widths and growing season temperatures. The
   main site-dependent differences in growth trends and temperature
   responses were attributed to altitude. Trees located at the upper
   boundary of the treeline ecotone reacted positively to preceding autumn
   temperatures, and their temperature response was slightly weaker than
   that of trees from the upper forest limit. Temporal trends in
   growth-climate responses consisted mainly of a gradual decrease in the
   influence of preceding October temperatures and an increasing effect of
   May temperatures towards the present. The proportion of younger trees
   generally increases upwards within the ecotone, and the most recent
   growth rates appear unprecedented in a century-long context.},

Title = {Flame temperature trends in reacting vanadium and tungsten ethoxide

Journal = {APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {105},
Number = {2},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We observe the ``invisible-to-the-naked-eye{''} flames of tungsten and
   vanadium ethoxide aerosols when ignited at moderate laser excitation (0
   < P (laser)< 70 W) by employing an IR thermo-graphic camera. No emission
   is seen in the visible range whether by the visible region cameras or by
   spectroscopy. The emissivity of the precursor solution measured was 0.80
   and 0.75 for tungsten and vanadium ethoxide, respectively. The spectral
   emissivities of the tungsten and vanadium ethoxide flames measured using
   FTIR-spectrometer were used to calculate the pyrolysis flame temperature
   at various laser intensities and wavelengths. New energy balance
   equations have been derived-the transient temperature one extended from
   Haggerty-Cannon equation and the other based on standard resonance
   analysis. Fitting these models to experimental data reveals that only
   small amounts (1.33\% and 4.32\%, respectively) of the laser power are
   used in the pyrolysis of the precursor ethoxide aerosols into the
   desired oxide nanostructures. The low levels of specific heat capacity
   values obtained in these sprays suggest that these are electronic heat
   capacities rather than lattice heat capacities; enthalpies are also
   obtained. The experimental temperature-laser power trends observed were
   in agreement with previous findings from Tenegal et al. (Chem. Phys.
   Lett. 335:155, 2001). The damping coefficients, and hence the saturation
   intensities confirm that the vanadium containing precursor liquid is
   harder to dissociate into final products than the tungsten precursor as
   observed experimentally.},

Title = {Air temperature trends related to changes in atmospheric circulation in
   the wider area of Greece},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Pages = {737-750},
Abstract = {Surface air temperature trends in the wider region of Greece during the
   period 1951-2007, related to atmospheric circulation, are examined in
   this work. A network of 31 meteorological stations in the Hellenic area
   and the Asia Minor coasts and National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR)
   reanalysis datasets were used for this purpose. The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis
   datasets were created by assimilating climate observations from
   different sources including ships, satellites, ground stations,
   radiosonde observations and radar. The general purpose of conducting the
   reanalyses was to produce multiyear global state-of-the-art gridded
   representations of atmospheric states, generated by a constant model and
   a constant data assimilation system. The findings of the analysis show
   that the mean annual surface air temperature in the wider region of
   Greece exhibits a pronounced cooling trend from the beginning of the
   1950s up to the mid-1970s. It then remained at low levels until the
   beginning of the 1990s, and then increased up to 2000, when a
   turning-point is clear although the temperature remained at high levels.
   The well-known atmospheric circulation indices of the wider region of
   Europe, namely the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), the
   Mediterranean Oscillation Index (MOI) and the North Sea Caspian Pattern
   Index (NCPI), were used to investigate the relationship between surface
   air temperature and atmospheric circulation in this region of the
   Eastern Mediterranean. The surface air temperature is not correlated to
   the NAOI, while it is statistically significantly (95\% confidence level
   (CL)) correlated to the MOI, but only during wintertime. On the
   contrary, good correlations, which are statistically significant (95\%
   CL), appear between the NCPI and the surface air temperature during all
   seasons, but particularly in winter.},

Abstract = {Trends of Mediterranean extreme temperatures are analysed for the period

   becomes apparent for the eastern Mediterranean region. Assessments of
   the 95th percentile of maximum temperatures in summer and of the 5th
   percentile of minimum temperatures in winter for the 21st century under
   enhanced greenhouse warming conditions are performed by means of
   statistical downscaling techniques. Mainly increases of both extreme
   indices result from these assessments, but considerable differences
   arise when using different predictors or predictor combinations,
   respectively. Furthermore, the results give strong indications that
   changes in temperature extremes do not follow a simple shift of the
   whole temperature distribution to higher values.},

Title = {Interannual variations and trends in zonal mean series of total ozone,

Journal = {IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {461-479},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The paper considers zonal mean ( 65 degrees S - 65 degrees N, with a
   step of 5 degrees) monthly mean NCEP/ DOE reanalysis data on zonal wind
   and temperature at levels of 20 to 100 mb and the TOMS data of version 8
   on total ozone ( TO) for the period 1979-2005. The results of
   calculating linear-trend coefficients, correlation coefficients, and
   characteristic decay times and the data of spectral analysis are
   presented. In recent decades, the decrease in TO and the cooling of the
   lower stratosphere were accompanied by a weakening of the westerly wind.
   For deseasonalized series, the significance of their linear trends are
   evaluated with the use of the Monte Carlo method and it is shown that TO
   trends are significant at a level of 0.99 in extratropical latitudinal
   zones and that temperature trends are significant everywhere except in a
   narrow equatorial zone and in latitudes south of 50 degrees S, whereas
   wind trends are significant only at a 50-mb level in the latitudinal
   belt 30 degrees- 50 degrees in both hemispheres. According to the
   results of spectral analysis, for the majority of latitudinal zones, a
   triplet in the range of quasibiennial oscillations and oscillations with
   periods of about 4 - 6 and 9 - 13 years manifest themselves most
   persistently in the series of temperature, wind, and TO. Maximum
   correlation coefficients of the series of TO, wind, and temperature are
   observed over the equator, and, depending on altitude and latitude, TO
   variations may lag or lead temperature and wind variations in phase.
   Latitudinal distributions of characteristic decay times show an increase
   in this parameter in tropical and equatorial zones and its opposite
   behavior with altitude for temperature and wind fields.},

   Wing Anti-Icing System Temperature},
Journal = {AEROSPACE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Airplane manufacturers are frequently faced with formidable challenges
   to improving both aircraft performance and customer safety. Ice
   accumulation on the wings of aircraft is one of the challenges, which
   could result in major accidents and a reduction in aerodynamic
   performance. Anti-icing systems, which use the hot bleed airflow from
   the engine compressor, are considered one of the most significant
   solutions utilized in aircraft applications to prevent ice accumulation.
   In the current study, a novel approach based on machine learning (ML)
   and the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed to predict the thermal
   performance characteristics of a partial span wing anti-icing system
   constructed using the NACA 23014 airfoil section. To verify the proposed
   strategy, the obtained results are compared with those obtained using
   computational ANSYS 2019 software. An artificial neural network (ANN) is
   used to build a forecasting model of wing temperature based on
   experimental data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data. In
   addition, the ThingSpeak platform is applied in this article to realize
   the concept of the IoT, collect the measured data, and publish the data
   in a private channel. Different performance metrics, namely, mean square
   error (MSE), maximum relative error (MAE), and absolute variance (R2),
   are used to evaluate the prediction model. Based on the performance
   indices, the results prove the efficiency of the proposed approach based
   on ANN and the IoT in designing a forecasting model to predict the wing
   temperature compared to the numerical CFD method, which consumes a lot
   of time and requires high-speed simulation devices. Therefore, it is
   suggested that the ANN-IoT approach be applied in aviation.},

Abstract = {Historically, observational information about atmospheric temperature
   has been limited due to a lack of suitable measurements. Recent advances
   in satellite observations provide new insight into the fine structure of
   the free atmosphere, with the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere
   comprising essential components of the climate system. This is a
   prerequisite for understanding the complex processes of this part of the
   atmosphere, which is also known to have a large impact on surface
   climate. With unprecedented resolution, latest climate observations
   reveal a dramatic warming of the atmosphere. The tropical upper
   troposphere has already warmed about 1 K during the first two decades of
   the 21st century. The tropospheric warming extends into the lower
   stratosphere in the tropics and southern hemisphere mid-latitudes,
   forming a prominent hemispheric asymmetry in the temperature trend
   structure. Together with seasonal trend patterns in the stratosphere,
   this indicates a possible change in stratospheric circulation.},

Title = {Long-term trends in herring growth primarily linked to temperature by
   gradient boosting regression trees},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Environmental change and fishing activity can produce directional trends
   in exploited fish populations with consequences for stock productivity.
   For herring in the Celtic Sea, size at age has been in steady decline
   since the mid 1980's. In the neighbouring herring stock off the
   Northwest coast of Ireland, reductions in size at age are noted after
   1990. Here, gradient boosting regression trees were used to investigate
   trends in extended time series (1959-2012) of length-at-age across both
   populations and to identify important variables associated with the
   observed declines in size. The predominant signal detected was a
   non-linear negative relationship between adult size and mean Sea Surface
   Temperature during the first growing season. Herring length was
   negatively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Weaker
   associations with indicators of food availability and population size
   were also detected. Across both populations a marked decline in length
   was observed at the upper end of the temperature range (similar to 14
   degrees C in the Celtic Sea and similar to 13 degrees C in the
   Northwest). Declines in length and associations with temperature were
   more pronounced in the Celtic Sea population which may be vulnerable to
   increasing sea temperatures due to its position at the southern limit of
   the species distribution.},

Title = {Trends in sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in the seven
   African Large Marine Ecosystems},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Metrics of the spatiotemporal variability of the physical and biological
   properties of Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) are critical indices of the
   trends and changes in these coastal systems. Given that the world's
   oceans, including coastal systems, are undergoing substantial changes as
   reported by a range of global assessments, the variability of these
   changes in space and time is important to understand, if the impacts are
   to be mitigated and adaptation measures required are to be appropriately
   applied. We have assessed the trends in Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
   (1982-2019) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (1997-2019) for all seven
   of the African LMEs. Our analysis revealed that as a whole almost 99\%
   of all the combined area of African LMEs has warmed. We found rates of
   SST warming of between 0.11 degrees C/dec (Agulhas LME) and 0.39 degrees
   C/dec (Mediterranean Sea LME) on average for entire LMEs, and regions
   with rates of as high as 0.58 degrees C/dec in the Canary Current LME.
   We also found that 1.1\% of the area of the LMEs had cooling trends in
   association with upwelling regions found in four of the seven LMEs. In
   this study, we have carefully considered the spatial distribution of
   warming and cooling in the respective LMEs and identified warming
   `hotspots' and re-catgorized the LMEs sub-regions into `slow',
   `moderate', `fast' and `superfast' warming areas, as defined in the
   Transboundary Waters Assessment Project of the IOC-UNECO-UNEP (2016). In
   terms of chlorophyll-a, we report that concentration estimates are
   highly heterogeneous in space and time and that robust trends are,
   however, difficult to extract from available data. Nevertheless, we do
   report an overall range in chlorophyll-a concentrations of 0.06-10.9
   mg/m(3) and the highest median concentrations in the two Eastern
   Boundary Upwelling Systems, that is, the Benguela Current LME and the
   Canary Current LME (which also contain the regions with the highest
   estimates of Net Primary Production (NPP) of 7063 and 7070 mg
   C/m(2)/day, respectively). The lowest concentrations are in the
   oligotrophic Agulhas Current LME, which also has the lowest estimate of
   NPP of 342 mg C/m(2)/day. General declines in chlorophyll-a
   concentrations are observed with statistically significant rates
   apparent in the Agulhas LME and contrasting areas of local and patchy
   increases in chlorophyll-a concentrations over time. Decadal trends in
   NPP are assessed as generally negative in the eastern LMEs and positive
   in the Western LMEs. The main conclusion from this study is that while
   the trends themselves are a further iteration of the manifestation of
   climate change impacts on African LMEs, it is the high degree of
   heterogeneity in these properties within the LMEs, along the trans-LME
   distribution in some instances, that must be taken into consideration
   for assessment of ecosystem impacts and effective management responses.},

Title = {Historical and projected trends in near-surface temperature indices for
   22 locations in South Africa},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {115},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {50-58},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Motivated by the risks posed by global warming, historical trends and
   future projections of near-surface temperature in South Africa have been
   investigated in a number of previous studies. These studies included the
   assessment of trends in average temperatures as well as extremes. In
   this study, historical trends in near-surface minimum and maximum
   temperatures as well as extreme temperature indices in South Africa were
   critically investigated by comparing quality-controlled station
   observations with downscaled model projections. Because climate models
   are the only means of generating future global warming projections, this
   critical point comparison between observed and downscaled model
   simulated time series can provide valuable information regarding the
   interpretation of model-generated projections. Over the historical
   1951-2005 period, both observed data and downscaled model projections
   were compared at 22 point locations in South Africa. An analysis of
   model projection trends was conducted over the period 2006-2095. The
   results from the historical analysis show that model outputs tend to
   simulate the historical trends well for annual means of daily maximum
   and minimum temperatures. However, noteworthy discrepancies exist in the
   assessment of temperature extremes. While both the historical model
   simulations and observations show a general warming trend in the extreme
   indices, the observational data show appreciably more spatial and
   temporal variability. On the other hand, model projections for the
   period 2006-2095 show that for the medium-to-low concentration
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, the projected decrease
   in cold nights is not as strong as is the case for the historically
   observed trends. However, the upward trends in warm nights for both the
   RCP4.5 and the high concentration RCP8.5 pathways are noticeably
   stronger than the historically observed trends. For cool days, future
   projections are comparable to the historically observed trends, but for
   hot days noticeably higher. Decreases in cold spells and increases in
   warm spells are expected to continue in future, with relatively strong
   positive trends on a regional basis. It is shown that projected trends
   are not expected to be constant into the future, in particular trends
   generated from the RCP8.5 pathway that show a strong increase in warming
   towards the end of the projection period.
   Significance:
   Comparison between the observed and simulated trends emphasises the
   necessity to assess the reliability of the output of climate models
   which have a bearing on the credibility of projections.
   The limitation of the models to adequately simulate the climate
   extremes, renders the projections conservative, which is an important
   result in the light of climate change adaptation.},

Abstract = {In the first part of the paper the long-term trends of the water
   temperature are analysed of the high mountain river Bela, and the
   lowland river Morava. The stations were selected to cover wide range of
   elevations. The trends were studied on 50-year data series by
   Mann-Kendal test. The long-term mean annual water temperature of the
   Bela river was 4.2 degrees C at Podbansk station, and it corresponds
   very well with the mean annual air temperature, which was 4.9 degrees C.
   The long-term mean annual water temperature of the Morava river was 11.1
   degrees C.
   The second aim of the study was to assess the water temperature
   gradient. The elevation gradient of the water temperature specifies the
   relation of the water temperature on elevation in natural conditions. It
   was determined for individual months and year seasons based on data
   series of 21 stations. There exists the negative relation between the
   water temperature and the elevation - with decrease of elevation the
   water temperature increases. The positive relation was observed only in
   the high mountain Jalovecky creek in specific winter conditions, and
   during short time periods. During the winter months the elevation
   gradient is the smallest. The biggest values of the water temperature
   gradient are observed in small streams during the summer season. The
   biggest gradient -1.06 degrees C per 100 m of elevation was estimated in
   August 2012.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Many investigators have used near-surface air temperature
   measurements to document a downward global trend in the diurnal
   temperature range (DTR). In this paper, we use radiosonde-based
   tropospheric measurements to examine vertical dimensions in trends in
   the DTR over the central United States. We find declining trends in DTR
   only at 85 kPa and the surface in the high-sun season, with the absolute
   trend at 85 kPa being greater than the trend at the surface suggesting
   that the trend in DTR is far more than an urban artifact in the data.
   There are no significant trends in DTR from 70 kPa to 25 kPa in any
   season. These results suggest that DTR trends in the low troposphere are
   likely influenced by near-surface processes such as variations in
   cloudiness, vegetation, or precipitation but not dominated by urban
   effects.},

Abstract = {In this work we have analysed the mean, maximum, and minimum temperature
   records of five localities in the northern Spanish Plateau during the
   last century. We have used the short-cut Bartlett test to examine their
   homogeneity. Our main proposal is the detection of trends and abrupt
   changes, using the Mann-Kendall test and the estimation of the magnitude
   of these. We have found that the minimum and mean temperatures have
   increased. The maxima do not present special behaviour. So the minimum
   temperatures show more influence over the mean temperatures than the
   others. Briefly, we have studied the possible linkage between the
   increase of minimum temperatures and urban growth in the area studied.},

Abstract = {The annual and seasonal trends of mean, maximum, and minimum
   temperatures were analyzed on the territory of Vojvodina, north Serbia.
   We used observed, quality controlled, homogenized, and spatially
   averaged data from 9 meteorological stations during two periods:
   1949-2013 and 1979-2013. Positive trends were found in 29 out of the 30
   analyzed time series using a linear tendency (trend) equation, while
   negative trends were found in only 1 case. After the application of the
   classical Mann-Kendall (MK) test, statistically significant positive
   trends were confirmed in 15 series, while in remaining cases,
   statistically significant trends were not confirmed. After applying the
   modified MK test, positive trends were found in 26 series, and 4 cases
   were with no trend. We find that significant positive trends are
   dominated during the year, spring and summer; and they are most numerous
   in the time series of monthly mean temperatures. In accordance with the
   behavior of analyzed trends, the increase of temperatures is dominant in
   Vojvodina.},

Title = {Assessing trends in lower tropospheric heat content in the central

Abstract = {Isobaric equivalent temperature (T-E) is the temperature that an air
   parcel would have if all associated water vapour were condensed and the
   resulting latent heat used to increase the temperature of the parcel. It
   is therefore an ideal metric for assessing changes in (1) total
   near-surface heat content associated with both temperature and moisture
   content and (2) the joint behaviour of temperature and humidity, which
   is relevant to both lower atmospheric stability and human heat stress
   during extreme temperature events. We present results from an analysis
   of 50years (1961-2010) of daily T-E and its temperature and moisture
   components at seven stations in the central United States. The annual
   means of daily T-Emax and T-Emin increased at all stations during the
   period of analysis with the largest changes occurring in T-Emin, largely
   as a result of increasing minimum air temperature. At western locations
   significant increases in the annual mean T-Emax were also observed,
   resulting from a combination of increases in T-max and humidity. Despite
   small summer (JJA) trends in maximum air temperature, summer T-E trends
   were generally larger than their annual counterparts. The timing of the
   observed variations and the resulting spatial pattern are consistent
   with observed changes in meridional moisture flux associated with the
   Great Plains low-level jet. Heat waves in the region were found to be
   characterized by increasing T-Emin, primarily resulting from increases
   in minimum air temperature. At western stations, heat waves were also
   characterized by increasing T-Emax as a result of positive trends in
   humidity. In most cases, equivalent temperature provides a perspective
   on local environmental change that differs from what is provided by
   consideration of temperature alone.},

Abstract = {Since past few decades, Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTILs) have
   extensively been used in organic synthesis as solvents, catalysts and
   catalyst/solvents in chemical as well as enzymatic reactions, whereas
   their interest in various different branches of science is expanding
   exponentially. RTILs show an enhanced performance in a number of
   syntheses involving carbohydrates when compared to the conventional
   organic solvents owing to their very interesting and attractive
   features,-viz. simple handling, high yield, less reaction time, benign
   environmental character, ease of synthesis and excellent recyclability.
   Carbohydrates are not known only for their vital commercial applications
   as foods, drugs and chemical feed stocks etc., but sugar based molecules
   are also identified to play pivotal roles in various pathologically and
   physiologically important biological processes including cellular
   recognition, adhesion, migration, invasion, communication,
   bacterial/viral infection, tumor metastasis etc. The clear understanding
   of role of sugars in these important biological events has led to the
   increased demand for significant amounts of carbohydrate based molecules
   for complete chemical, biological, medicinal, and pharmacological
   investigations. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to develop
   novel and facile procedures for the synthesis of sugar based molecules
   of great biological interest and their modification. With an increasing
   focus on the glycomics, the RTILs solvent may offer promising solutions
   in carbohydrate chemistry. However, there is lack of recent and concise
   reports dealing with the RTILs in the field of carbohydrate chemistry
   particularly, in relevance to dissolution and functionalization, and
   their further modifications including glycosylation. This review
   highlights the application of RTILs that have been extensively used in
   carbohydrate chemistry.},

Abstract = {A detailed analysis of climatic trends in the longitudinally averaged
   temperature, zonal wind velocity, and activity of a stationary planetary
   wave with the zonal wave number 1 (SPW1) is made for January. The
   results of analysis indicate that marked climatic temperature variations
   having opposite signs in the low and high latitudes are observed. These
   variations cause the relevant variations in the intensity and
   arrangement of maxima of tropospheric jet flows and, thereby, are
   responsible for changes in SPW1 propagation conditions. SPW1 propagation
   from the troposphere into the upper atmosphere is calculated with a
   linearized model by using the distributions of zonal mean flow that are
   characteristic of the 1960s and the early 21st century. These
   calculations indicate that, over the past 40 years, the propagation
   conditions have improved ``on average{''} and the calculated SPW1
   amplitude in the stratosphere and mesosphere of the winter hemisphere
   has increased substantially. Analysis of the amplitudes of the zonal
   wind velocity for SPW1 that were obtained from the NCEP/NCAR data is
   consistent with the results of simulation and shows that some
   enhancement of SPW1 activity in the lower stratosphere has been actually
   observed in recent years. These variations in the amplitudes are also
   accompanied by the enhancement of SPW1 interannual variability.},

Title = {Permafrost and Active Layer Temperature and Freeze/Thaw Timing Reflect
   Climatic Trends at Bayelva, Svalbard},

Abstract = {Permafrost warming has been observed all around the Arctic, however,
   variations in temperature trends and their drivers remain poorly
   understood. We present a comprehensive analysis of climatic changes
   spanning 25 years (1998-2023) at Bayelva (78.92094 degrees N, 11.83333
   degrees E) on Spitzbergen, Svalbard. The quality controlled hourly data
   set includes air temperature, radiation fluxes, snow depth, rainfall,
   active layer temperature and moisture, and, since 2009, permafrost
   temperature. Our Bayesian trend analysis reveals an annual air
   temperature increase of 0.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C/decade and strongest
   warming in September and October. We observed a significant shortening
   of the snow cover by -14 +/- 8 days/decade, coupled with reduced winter
   snow depth. The active layer simultaneously warmed by 0.6 +/- 0.7
   degrees C/decade at the top and 0.8 +/- 0.5 degrees C/decade at the
   bottom. While the soil surface got drier, in particular during summer,
   soil moisture below increased in accordance with the longer unfrozen
   period and higher winter temperatures. The thawed period prolonged by
   10-15 days/decade at different depths. In contrast to earlier top-soil
   warming, we observed stable temperatures since 2010 and only little
   permafrost warming (0.14 +/- 0.13 degrees C/decade). This is likely due
   to recently stable winter air temperature and continuously decreasing
   winter snow depth. This recent development highlights a complex
   interplay among climate and soil variables. Our distinctive long-term
   data set underscores (a) the changes in seasonal warming patterns, (b)
   the influential role of snow cover decline, and (c) that air temperature
   alone is not a sufficient indicator of change in permafrost
   environments, thereby highlighting the importance of investigating a
   wider range of parameters, such as soil moisture and snow
   characteristics.
   Permafrost is warming across the Arctic, but it is not yet well
   understood why temperature trends vary and what affects them the most.
   Our detailed study investigates 25 years (1998-2023) of data at the
   Bayelva permafrost observatory on Svalbard. We analyzed a
   quality-controlled data set, including hourly measurements of air
   temperature, radiation, snow depth, rainfall, permafrost temperature,
   and active layer conditions. We looked beyond annual averages, examining
   changes in each month. The air warmed strongly by 0.9 degrees C/decade
   and even stronger in September and October. Continuous snow cover
   shortened by -14 days/decade and winter snow depth decreased.
   Simultaneously, the active layer warmed by 0.6 degrees C/decade at the
   top and 0.8 degrees C/decade at the bottom. While the surface dried in
   summer, deeper soil layers became moister due to a longer unfrozen
   period and higher temperatures in winter. The thawed period extended by
   10-15 days/decade, with slightly stronger changes toward later freezing
   in autumn. We found that soil warming stopped in recent years and
   attributed this effect to the lower winter snow depth since 2010.
   Therefore, if we want to know how permafrost warms or cools in the
   future, we need to consider additional measurements such as soil

Abstract = {The rate of warming of the Arctic surface temperature has exceeded that
   of the global surface temperature in recent decades. However, the
   underlying process and causes of the long-term warming remain uncertain.
   In this paper, we explored the factors underlying variation in Arctic
   mean surface temperature anomalies (AMTA) using a piecewise linear model
   for 1920-2018. This analysis indicated that the change in AMTA during
   the study period could be divided into three segments, with AMTA
   increasing from 1920 to 1938, declining from 1939 to 1976, and finally
   increasing rapidly after 1977. By a newly developed rigorous formalism
   of information flow, we found a one-way causality from the driving
   forces to AMTA. Moreover, the AMTA evolution could mainly be attributed
   to a combined effect of anthropogenic and natural factors (e.g.,
   CO(2,)aerosol, and PDO). During the first warming stage (1920-1938), the
   PDO and aerosols are the main factors determining the change in AMTA.
   During the second warming stage (1977-2018), greenhouse gases, dominated
   by CO2, are the major factors accounting for the Arctic warming. In
   1939-1976, the observed cooling may be associated with aerosols, clouds,
   and land use. A better understanding of the driving mechanism underlying
   AMTA evolution provides insight into the historical Arctic climate
   change, and can improve the prediction of future changes in AMTA.},

Abstract = {A method is presented to assess the influence of changes in Arctic cloud
   cover on the surface temperature trend, allowing for a more robust
   diagnosis of causes for surface warming or cooling. Seasonal trends in
   satellite-derived Arctic surface temperature under clear-, cloudy-, and
   all-sky conditions are examined for the period 1982-2004. The
   satellite-derived trends are in good agreement with trends in the
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis
   product and surface-based weather station measurements in the Arctic.
   Surface temperature trends under clear and cloudy conditions have
   patterns similar to the all-sky trends, though the magnitude of the
   trends under cloudy conditions is smaller than those under clear-sky
   conditions, illustrating the negative feedback of clouds on the surface
   temperature trends. The all-sky surface temperature trend is divided
   into two parts: the first part is a linear combination of the surface
   temperature trends under clear and cloudy conditions; the second part is
   caused by changes in cloud cover as a function of the clear-cloudy
   surface temperature difference. The relative importance of these two
   components is different in the four seasons, with the first part more
   important in spring, summer, and autumn, but with both parts being
   equally important in winter. The contribution of biases in satellite
   retrievals is also evaluated.},

Title = {Climatology and changing trend of the regional high temperature process

Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Based on the historical records of the daily maximum temperature data in
   2419 national meteorological stations of China, the regional high
   temperature process (RHTP) in China from 1961 to 2020 is identified
   objectively, following the method adopted in operation by the National
   Climate Center, China Meteorological Administration. And then the
   climatology and changing trends are investigated. It is found that there
   are four RHTPs per year in China on average, occurring from early May to
   early October and concentrating from late June to late August. And it is
   the most frequent in July and August. The mean earliest start date of
   the process is on 18 June and the mean latest ending date is on 31
   August. For each process, the mean extent includes 760 stations, the
   average daily maximum temperature is 36.4 degrees C and the mean
   duration reaches 13 days. From 1961 to 2020, the beginning of the RHTP
   advanced significantly but the ending has delayed dramatically, and then
   the period with the RHTP occurring has lengthened correspondingly. The
   frequency of the RHTP in China decreased from the 1960s to the 1980s but
   transferred to an increase entering the early 1990s. Similarly, the mean
   daily maximum temperature averaged in all processes of a year decreased
   first and then increased. And the upward trend is significant from 1980
   to 2020. In the recent 6 decades, both the extent and duration of the
   RHTP in China have shown a significant increasing trend. Moreover, the
   comprehensive index combining the mean daily maximum temperature,
   extent, and duration of a process has also increased significantly.
   Additionally, there is no abrupt change detected in the time series of
   the first start date, the latest ending date, the length of the period
   with the RHTP occurring, and the frequency of the RHTP in China from
   1961 to 2020. However, the mean intensity of the RHTP transmitted from
   weakening to intensifying in 1987 and further strengthened significantly
   in 2002. Moreover, the extent, duration, and comprehensive index of the
   RHTP increased abruptly in 1998, 2016, and 2012, respectively. Overall,
   the RHTP in China has changed significantly in recent 6 decades, and
   then the heat wave disaster tends to be heavier.},

Title = {Past and future snowmelt trends in the Swiss Alps: the role of
   temperature and snowpack},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {165},
Number = {3-4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The start of the growing season for alpine plants is primarily
   determined by the date of snowmelt. We analysed time series of snow
   depth at 23 manually operated and 15 automatic (IMIS) stations between
   1055 and 2555 m asl in the Swiss Central Alps. Between 1958 and 2019,
   snowmelt dates occurred 2.8 +/- 1.3 days earlier in the year per decade,
   with a strong shift towards earlier snowmelt dates during the late 1980s
   and early 1990s, but non-significant trends thereafter. Snowmelt dates
   at high-elevation automatic stations strongly correlated with snowmelt
   dates at lower-elevation manual stations. At all elevations, snowmelt
   dates strongly depended on spring air temperatures. More specifically,
   44\% of the variance in snowmelt dates was explained by the first day
   when a three-week running mean of daily air temperatures passed a 5
   degrees C threshold. The mean winter snow depth accounted for 30\% of
   the variance. We adopted the effects of air temperature and snowpack
   height to Swiss climate change scenarios to explore likely snowmelt
   trends throughout the twenty-first century. Under a high-emission
   scenario (RCP8.5), we simulated snowmelt dates to advance by 6 days per
   decade by the end of the century. By then, snowmelt dates could occur
   one month earlier than during the reference periods (1990-2019 and
   2000-2019). Such early snowmelt may extend the alpine growing season by
   one third of its current duration while exposing alpine plants to
   shorter daylengths and adding a higher risk of freezing damage.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {60},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Environmental change and fishing activity can produce directional trends
   in exploited fish populations with consequences for stock productivity.
   For herring in the Celtic Sea, size at age has been in steady decline
   since the mid 1980's. In the neighbouring herring stock off the
   Northwest coast of Ireland, reductions in size at age are noted after
   1990. Here, gradient boosting regression trees were used to investigate
   trends in extended time series (1959-2012) of length-at-age across both
   populations and to identify important variables associated with the
   observed declines in size. The predominant signal detected was a
   non-linear negative relationship between adult size and mean Sea Surface
   Temperature during the first growing season. Herring length was
   negatively correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Weaker
   associations with indicators of food availability and population size
   were also detected. Across both populations a marked decline in length
   was observed at the upper end of the temperature range (similar to 14
   degrees C in the Celtic Sea and similar to 13 degrees C in the
   Northwest). Declines in length and associations with temperature were
   more pronounced in the Celtic Sea population which may be vulnerable to
   increasing sea temperatures due to its position at the southern limit of
   the species distribution.},

Title = {Timescales for determining temperature and dissolved oxygen trends in
   the Long Island Sound (LIS) estuary},
Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {151},
Pages = {1-7},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Long-term time series represent a critical part of the oceanographic
   community's efforts to discern natural and anthropogenically forced
   variations in the environment. They provide regular measurements of
   climate relevant indicators including temperature, oxygen
   concentrations, and salinity. When evaluating time series, it is
   essential to isolate long-term trends from autocorrelation in data and
   noise due to natural variability. Herein we apply a statistical
   approach, well-established in atmospheric time series, to key parameters
   in the U.S. east coast's Long Island Sound estuary (LIS). Analysis shows
   that the LIS time series (established in the early 1990s) is
   sufficiently long to detect significant trends in physical-chemical
   parameters including temperature (T) and dissolved oxygen (DO). Over the
   last two decades, overall (combined surface and deep) LIS T has
   increased at an average rate of 0.08 +/- 0.03 degrees C yr(-1) while
   overall DO has dropped at an average rate of 0.03 +/- 0.01 mg L-1 yr(-1)
   since 1994 at the 95\% confidence level. This trend is notably faster
   than the global open ocean T trend (0.01 degrees C yr(-1)), as might be
   expected for a shallower estuarine system. T and DO trends were always
   significant for the existing time series using four month data
   increments. Rates of change of DO and T in LIS are strongly correlated
   and the rate of decrease of DO concentrations is consistent with the
   expected reduced solubility of DO at these higher temperatures. Thus,
   changes in T alone, across decadal timescales can account for between 33
   and 100\% of the observed decrease in DO. This has significant
   implications for other dissolved gases and the long-term management of
   LIS hypoxia.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that the low-frequency sea surface
   temperature (SST) variability in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea
   (YECS) is linked to large-scale climate variability, but explanations on
   the mechanisms vary. This study examines the low-frequency variability
   and trends of some atmospheric and oceanic variables to discuss their
   different effects on the YECS warming. The increasing temperature trend
   is also observed at a hydrographic section transecting the Kuroshio. The
   increasing rate of ocean temperature decreases with depth, which might
   result in an increase in vertical stratification and a decrease in
   vertical mixing, and thus plays a positive role on the YECS warming. The
   surface net heat flux (downward positive) displays a decreasing trend,
   which is possibly a result of the YECS warming, and, in turn, inhibits
   it. Wind speeds show different trends in different datasets, such that
   its role in the YECS warming is uncertain. The trends in wind stress
   divergence and curl have large uncertainties, so their effects on SST
   warming are still unclear. The Kuroshio heat transport calculated in
   this study, displays no significantly increasing trend, so is an
   unlikely explanation for the SST warming. Limited by sparse ocean
   observations, sophisticated assimilative climate models are still needed
   to unravel the mechanisms behind the YECS warming.},

Title = {Influence of patterns of climate variability on the difference between

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Pages = {2412-2428},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {During the past 20 years, satellite measurements of tropospheric
   temperature have shown a slower rate of global temperature increase than
   surface air temperature, yielding an increase in the surface to
   lower-troposphere lapse rate of 0.12 K decade(-1) from 1979 to August
   2001. This increase in lapse rate was preceded by a decrease over the
   previous 15-yr interval.
   The influence of patterns of climate variability on the global- and
   hemispheric-scale lapse rate was investigated, based on observations of
   surface and tropospheric temperature from satellite, radiosonde, surface
   air, and sea surface data. It was found that a substantial fraction of
   winter-to-winter lapse rate variability in the Northern Hemisphere
   mid-to high latitudes is dynamically induced. In the Tropics and
   subtropics, a distinctive signature of El Nino is apparent in the
   interannual variations in lapse rate. A small additional amount of
   month-to-month variability can be attributed to zonally symmetric
   circulation changes at lower latitudes that are linearly independent of
   ENSO. Trends in these patterns can account only for a small fraction of
   the observed trend in lapse rate. The combination of strong surface
   warming and very small tropospheric warming in the Tropics and
   subtropics over the recent 21 yr is extremely unusual in the context of
   data from a coupled climate model. The same can be said of the observed
   trends of the previous 15 yr. Thus, it is concluded that structured
   patterns of climate variability account for much of the variability in
   lapse rate on monthly and interannual timescales, but not on
   interdecadal timescales.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive trend analysis of spatiotemporal
   temperature change patterns over the territory of what is now the Czech
   Republic (CR) during the 1961-2019 period. Employing daily mean
   temperatures (TAVG), maximum (TMAX) and minimum (TMIN) temperatures and
   diurnal temperature range (DTR), supplied by 133 stations of the Czech
   Hydrometeorological Institute, daily, monthly, seasonal and annual
   series were calculated for four altitudinal groups and the entire CR,
   for which linear trends were calculated and further analysed. For the
   purposes of relative trend comparison, the linear trends were also
   calculated from standardized series (mean 0,SD1, in 1961-1990). All
   seasonal and annual TAVG, TMAX and TMIN series exhibit statistically
   significant increasing trends, with the exceptions of only a few cases
   for winter (DJF) and autumn (SON). DTR trends increase significantly in
   spring (MAM) and summer (JJA), but decrease in DJF and SON. The highest
   increases in trends occur in JJA and from stations at lower altitudes
   for groups I (up to 300 m asl) and II (301-600 m asl). Trends in JJA and
   SON TMIN are relatively higher than in TMAX, while the opposite holds
   true of DJF and MAM. Comparing the three decades after 1990 with the
   1961-1990 normal, each decade was generally warmer than the previous
   period, with particularly enhanced warming in 2011-2019. This is also
   reflected in prominent increases in cumulative temperature sums
   throughout the year. The results obtained are discussed in the context
   of other European papers and with respect to explaining existing
   differences.},

Title = {Analysis of trends in air temperature at Chinese stations considering
   the long-range correlation effect},
Journal = {PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {533},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In this study, we consider the long-range correlation (LRC) effect on
   trend analysis. We use daily maximum and minimum air temperature at 590
   Chinese meteorological stations in recent 46 years. Before estimating
   trends in daily air temperature, we filter out the periodic component by
   removing the mean record for each calendar date. With considering the
   LRC effect, we extract the observed trends in both daily maximum and
   minimum air temperature, test their significance, and compare the
   results to those obtained by the traditional linear regression which
   ignores the LRC effect. It is substantiated that by inflating the
   estimation uncertainty LRC can increase the chance of the observed
   trends to be insignificant by about 4 times and 10 times for daily
   maximum and minimum air temperature at Chinese stations, respectively.
   In addition, the observed trends in daily minimum air temperature are
   found to be much more significant than those in the daily maximum
   records. With consideration of the LRC effect, we apply a method
   proposed by Rybski and Bunde (2009) based on the detrended fluctuation
   analysis (DFA) to estimate the most-likely trend in temperature at five
   representative stations (Tianjin, Hohhot, Nanjing, Haikou, and Xining),
   which correspond to the five typical climate in China, i.e., temperate
   monsoon climate, temperate continental climate, subtropical monsoon
   climate, tropical monsoon climate, and plateau mountain climate,
   respectively. Comparing to the DFA-based method, it is demonstrated that
   the traditional linear regression may overestimate the most-likely
   trends at these five stations by more than 100\% and up to 36\% for
   daily maximum and minimum air temperature, respectively. Therefore, the
   LRC effect must be considered in trend analysis of temperature at
   Chinese stations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {{[} 1] Soil temperature is an important indicator of frozen ground
   status, driven at least partly by air temperature variability. In this
   study we apply singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to detect trends and
   oscillations in annual and seasonal time series of surface air
   temperature ( SAT) and soil temperature (ST). We investigate soil
   temperatures at depths of 0.4, 1.6, and 3.2 m for five
   permafrost-occupied regions in Russia. We use SAT data for 1902 - 1995
   and ST data for 1960 - 1990. The trends show an increase in annual SAT
   and ST from the end of the 1960s across all five regions, and this
   warming exceeds that of the preceding period in the Central Siberian
   Plateau and Transbaikalia. Oscillations in annual SAT and ST time series
   are coincident in the West Siberian Plain (7.7 year period) and in the
   western Central Siberian Plateau and Transbaikalia (2.7 year period). In
   general, on a seasonal basis, 2 - 3 year oscillations in ST and SAT are
   coincident during winter, spring, and autumn across the regions and are
   also evident in the annual ST time series in the Central Siberian
   Plateau and Transbaikalia. We also find a decadal oscillation (9.8 year
   period), which is coincident for winter SAT and ST, over the western
   Central Siberian Plateau only. Although summer SAT and ST oscillations (
   5 - 8 year periods) are coincident for all investigated territories (
   except to the east of the Lena River), in the annual ST time series they
   are identified only for the West Siberian Plain. We document the degree
   to which SAT controls ST in each region and explore the causative
   factors for some of the dominant periods. The maximum effect of SAT
   increases on permafrost may be observed in the Central Siberian Plateau
   and Transbaikalia, while elsewhere the observed ST increases do not
   threaten permafrost areas.},

Title = {Difficulties in obtaining reliable temperature trends: Reconciling the
   surface and satellite microwave sounding unit records},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Pages = {945-967},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A chronic difficulty in obtaining reliable climate records from
   satellites has been changes in instruments, platforms, equator-crossing
   times, and algorithms. The microwave sounding unit (MSU) tropospheric
   temperature record has overcome some of these problems, but evidence is
   presented that it too contains unreliable trends over a 17-yr period
   (1979-95) because of transitions involving different satellites and
   complications arising from nonatmospheric signals associated with the
   surface. The two primary MSU measures of tropospheric temperature
   contain different error characteristics and trends. The MSU channel 2
   record exhibits a slight warming trend since 1979. Its broad vertical
   weighting function means that the temperature signal originates from
   throughout the troposphere and part of the lower stratosphere;
   intersatellite comparisons reveal low noise levels. Off-nadir channel 2
   data are combined to provide an adjusted weighting function (called MSU
   2R) without the stratospheric signal, but at a cost of an increased
   influence of surface emissions. Land surface microwave emissions, which
   account for about 20\% of the total signal, depend on ground temperature
   and soil moisture and are subject to large variations associated with
   the diurnal cycle. The result is that MSU 2R noise levels are a factor
   of 3 larger than for MSU 2 and are sufficient to corrupt trends when
   several satellite records are merged.
   After allowing for physical differences between the satellite and
   surface records, large differences remain in temperature trends over the
   Tropics where there is a strong and deterministic coupling with the
   surface. The authors use linear regression with observed sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs) and an atmospheric general circulation model to
   relate the tropical MSU and surface datasets. These and alternative
   analyses of the MSU data, radiosonde data, and comparisons between the
   MSU 2R and channel 2 records, with estimates of their noise, are used
   to. show that the downward trend in tropical MSU 2R temperatures is very
   likely spurious. Tropical radiosonde records are of limited use in
   resolving the discrepancies because of artificial trends arising from
   changes in instruments or sensors; however, comparisons with Australian
   radiosondes show a spurious downward jump in MSU 2R in mid-1991, which
   is not evident in MSU 2. Evaluation of reanalyzed tropical temperatures
   from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts shows that they contain very
   different and false trends, as the analyses are only as good as the
   input database.
   Statistical analysis of the MSU 2R record objectively identifies two
   stepwise downward discontinuities that coincide with satellite
   transitions. The first is in mid-1981, prior to which only one satellite
   was in operation for much of the time so the diurnal cycle was not well
   sampled. Tropical SST anomalies over these years were small, in
   agreement with the Southern Oscillation index, yet the MSU 2R values
   were anomalously warm by similar to 0.25 degrees C. The second
   transition from NOAA-10 to NOAA-12 in mid-1991 did not involve an
   overlap except with NOAA-11, which suffered from a large drift in its
   equator-crossing times. MSU 2R anomalies have remained anomalously cold
   since mid-1991 by similar to 0.1 degrees C. Adding the two stepwise
   discontinuities to the tropical MSU 2R record allows it to be completely
   reconciled with the SST record within expected noise levels. The
   statistical results also make physical sense as the tropical satellite
   anomalies are magnified relative to SST anomalies by a factor of similar
   to 1.3, which is the amplification expected following the saturated
   adiabatic lapse rate to the level of the peak weighting function of MSU
   2R.},

Abstract = {The permanent magnet is subject to high-temperature demagnetization
   under high-torque or high-speed operating conditions. Accurate
   estimation of the temperature of the permanent magnets allows for better
   improvement of the cooling system, such as flow distribution and
   structural optimization. It is also the object of research in tracking
   and monitoring technology, because timely sensing of the temperature of
   the permanent magnet is the key to generate thermal protection
   mechanisms for the cooling system and active thermal protection system.
   In recent years, techniques for estimating and monitoring the
   temperature of permanent magnet have evolved, and a large body of
   valuable literature has been generated in the process. Therefore, this
   paper discusses this literature by systematically categorizing it into
   estimation and monitoring techniques in order to promote more
   researchers to understand the advantages of various methods and
   rationally choose the research topics they are most interested in. In
   addition, trends and challenges in various research directions were

Title = {Land cover change effects on land surface temperature trends in an
   African urbanizing dryland region},
Journal = {CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Land use-land cover (LULC) association with land surface temperature
   (LST) is well known. Knowledge about land change effects on LST in
   urbanizing African drylands is very limited. We examined LST and
   vegetation variations in semi-arid Gaborone (Botswana's capital) using
   MODIS daytime and night-time LST (DNLST), and Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) between 2000 and 2018. Significant land
   transitions were identified in the land cover change map using Change
   Vector Analysis of Landsat-based biophysical indices of vegetation,
   water and bare soil. Artificial surface and tree-covered areas were net
   gaining categories, whereas cropland and grassland were net losing
   categories. Detailed profiling of DNLST trends and breakpoints was
   conducted in five relatively homogenous sites representing land
   cover/transitions. Increasing NDVI and DNLST trends found were
   significant. Per class, LST change at daytime and night-time are as
   follows: built-up areas (1.8 K, 2.2 K), Gaborone dam (5.7 K, 0.2 K),
   settlement expansion areas (4.6 K, 2.2 K), and rural settlement (2.0 K,
   1.5 K). The cooling effect of irrigation on daytime LST was higher than
   night-time LST as daytime LST trend as low as -0.4 K was found in areas
   of irrigated croplands. Validation with synoptic station temperature
   data and dam water levels provides empirical evidence that MODIS gave
   credible DNLST estimates in this urbanizing dryland area. Our results
   also suggest the role of climate variability in urbanizing drylands
   alongside land cover change in controlling the LST. Regardless, coupling
   DNLST and land cover changes can provide useful information for spatial
   planning of drylands to create smart cities that are resilient to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Coriolis mass flow metering technology is widely used within the Oil and
   Gas industry. There is now an increased focus on utilising the
   technology's ability to calculate fluid density in areas such as fluid
   contamination indication and feedback for process control loops.
   However, it is common for flow meters of this type to be installed
   within environments that are subject to severe variations in ambient
   conditions. One such condition, which this paper seeks to address is the
   effect that air temperature surrounding the meter body can have on the
   Coriolis meter's ability to correctly calculate fluid density,
   specifically in scenarios where there is a significant differential
   between the fluid temperature present within the meter internals and the
   surrounding ambient air temperature. This paper details an experimental
   program that was carried out at NEL where the ambient temperature
   surrounding a Coriolis meter was varied in a controlled manner while
   diagnostic data output from the meter were logged over time. Analysis of
   the data has allowed for the identification of repeatable drift in both
   the calculated fluid density and indicated fluid temperature process
   values output by the metering technology.},

   trends in the Yellow Sea},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {24-38},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability of sea surface temperatures (SST)
   in the Yellow Sea was investigated using satellite data and in-situ
   measurements over 29 years from 1981 to 2009. We found that the first
   empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of SST variability, which
   accounts for 47.59\% of the total SST variance, exhibited a warming
   signal during the study period. We examined the relationships between
   the dominant EOF mode, long-term trends of SST changes and in-situ
   temperatures, and bathymetry. As a result, the shallow regions
   demonstrated more significant increasing rates than the deep area in the
   Yellow Sea. Vertical stratification of the water column revealed
   long-term changes, which led to differential surface warming. The
   warming rates decayed monotonically with depth. The spatial features of
   long-term SST warming trends were most remarkable near the Yangtze
   River, due to the effect of river discharge. Abrupt changes in the
   time-varying amplitude of the first EOF mode in winter could be
   explained by Arctic Oscillation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Climate Change Scenario in Kashmir Valley, India, based on Seasonal and
   Annual Average Temperature Trends},

Abstract = {The trends in climatic indices such as the seasonal and annual average
   temperatures in Kashmir valley were examined by established statistical
   technique of linear regression analysis. The rates of increase/decrease
   of these climatic indices were computed by linear regression slope (b)
   method. To explain the significance of observed trends, 1-tailed
   Student's T-test (at 95\% confidence level) was also carried out. The
   results reveal that on the whole there have been increasing trends in
   the seasonal and annual average temperatures in the studied area, with
   the winter and spring seasons warming at higher rates (statistically
   significant) than the summer and autumn. The results show that during
   the period 19912005, the winter, spring and summer average temperatures
   were higher by 1.0 degrees C and 0.4 degrees C and 0.3 degrees C from
   their respective standard normals of 1961-1990. The autumn remained
   unchanged during this period. However the annual average temperature was
   higher by 0.4 degrees C from its respective standard normal during this
   period.
   Moreover, during the thirty-year period, 1961-1990 there have been 16
   instances when the annual average temperature (T-avg) has been 11
   degrees C or more. But during the fifteen-year period, 1991-2005 there
   have been 13 instances when the temperature has been 11 degrees C.
   Furthermore, during the later period, the only two years of 1991 and
   1992 have recorded the average temperature lesser than 11 degrees C.
   1991 and 1992 were the years when a drop in air temperature was recorded
   globally. This drop in the average temperature is also reflected in our
   data set.},

Title = {Impact of Changes in Climate and Halocarbons on Recent Lower
   Stratosphere Ozone and Temperature Trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2599-2611},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The primary focus of this paper is the analysis of the roles of
   long-term increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) and sea surface temperatures
   (used as indicators of climate change) and man-made halocarbons
   (indicators of chemical ozone depletion linked to halogens) in
   explaining the observed trend of ozone in the tropical lower
   stratosphere and implications for related variables including
   temperature and tropopause height. Published estimates indicate a
   decrease of approximately 10\% in observed ozone concentrations in this
   region between 1979 and 2005. Using a coupled chemistry-climate
   atmosphere model forced by observed sea surface temperatures and surface
   concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases and halocarbons, the
   authors show that the simulations display substantial decreases in
   tropical ozone that compare well in both latitudinal and vertical
   structure with those observed. Based on sensitivity simulations, the
   analysis indicates that the decreases in the lower stratospheric (85-50
   hPa) tropical ozone distribution are mostly associated with increases in
   CO2 and sea surface temperatures, in contrast to those at higher
   latitudes, which are largely driven by halocarbon increases. Factors
   influencing temperature trends and tropopause heights in this region are
   also probed. It is shown that the modeled temperature trends in the
   lower tropical stratosphere are also associated with increases in CO2
   and sea surface temperatures. Following the analysis of lower
   stratospheric tropical temperature trends, the secondary focus of this
   paper is on related changes in tropopause height. Much of the simulated
   tropopause rise in the tropical zone as measured by tropopause height is
   found to be linked to increases in sea surface temperatures and CO2,
   while increases in halocarbons dominate the tropopause height changes in
   the subtropics near 308; both drivers thus affect different regions of
   the simulated changes in the position of the tropopause. Finally, it is
   shown that halocarbon increases dominate the changes in the width of the
   region where modeled total ozone displays tropical character (as
   indicated by low values of the column abundance). Hence the findings
   suggest that climate changes and halocarbon changes make different
   contributions to different metrics used to characterize tropical change.},

Abstract = {The physical science linking human-induced increases in greenhouse
   gasses to the warming of the global climate system is well established,
   but the implications of this warming for ecosystem processes and
   services at regional scales is still poorly understood. Thus, the
   objectives of this work were to: (1) describe rates of change in
   temperature averages and extremes for western Montana, a region
   containing sensitive resources and ecosystems, (2) investigate
   associations between Montana temperature change to hemispheric and
   global temperature change, (3) provide climate analysis tools for land
   and resource managers responsible for researching and maintaining
   renewable resources, habitat, and threatened/endangered species and (4)
   integrate our findings into a more general assessment of climate impacts
   on ecosystem processes and services over the past century. Over 100
   years of daily and monthly temperature data collected in western
   Montana, USA are analyzed for long-term changes in seasonal averages and
   daily extremes. In particular, variability and trends in temperature
   above or below ecologically and socially meaningful thresholds within
   this region (e.g., -17.8A degrees C (0A degrees F), 0A degrees C (32A
   degrees F), and 32.2A degrees C (90A degrees F)) are assessed. The daily
   temperature time series reveal extremely cold days (a parts per thousand
   currency signaEuro parts per thousand a'17.8A degrees C) terminate on
   average 20 days earlier and decline in number, whereas extremely hot
   days (a parts per thousand yen32A degrees C) show a three-fold increase
   in number and a 24-day increase in seasonal window during which they
   occur. Results show that regionally important thresholds have been
   exceeded, the most recent of which include the timing and number of the
   0A degrees C freeze/thaw temperatures during spring and fall. Finally,
   we close with a discussion on the implications for Montana's ecosystems.
   Special attention is given to critical processes that respond
   non-linearly as temperatures exceed critical thresholds, and have
   positive feedbacks that amplify the changes.},

Volume = {5},
Pages = {81-84},
Abstract = {In order to detect microscale influences on observed surface air
   temperature changes, 29 years' data on the AMeDAS network were used to
   identify the relation between temperature trends and wind speed trends,
   which were regarded as reflecting the changes of site exposure. The
   results were found to differ according to time of the day and the mean
   wind speed of the site. For stations with relatively high mean wind
   speed (>= 1.5 m s(-1)), a significant negative correlation is found
   between daytime temperature trends and wind speed trends. For stations
   with low wind speed (< 1.0 m s(-1)), evening temperature trends are
   negatively correlated with wind speed trends, whereas daytime
   temperature trends tend to be positively correlated with them. These
   facts give statistical evidence of the dependence of temperature trends
   on microscale environmental changes, with complications according to the
   degree of site exposure.},

Title = {Comparison of lower-tropospheric temperature climatologies and trends at
   low and high elevation radiosonde sites},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Observations of rapid retreat of tropical mountain glaciers over the
   past two decades seem superficially at odds with observations of little
   or no warming of the tropical lower troposphere during this period. To
   better understand the nature of temperature and atmospheric freezing
   level variability in mountain regions, on seasonal to multidecadal time
   scales, this paper examines long-term surface and upper-air temperature
   observations from a global network of 26 pairs of radiosonde stations.
   Temperature data from high and low elevation stations are compared at
   four levels: the surface, the elevation of the mountain station surface,
   1 km above the mountain station, and 2 km above the mountain station.
   Climatological temperature differences between mountain and low
   elevation sites show diurnal and seasonal structure, as well as
   latitudinal and elevational differences. Atmospheric freezing-level
   heights tend to decrease with increasing latitude, although maximum
   heights are found well north of the equator, over the Tibetan Plateau.
   Correlations of interannual anomalies of temperature between paired high
   and low elevation sites are relatively high at 1 or 2 km above the
   mountain station. But at the elevation of the station, or at the two
   surface elevations, correlations are lower, indicating decoupling of the
   boundary layer air from the free troposphere. Trends in temperature and
   freezing-level height are generally upward, both during 1979 - 2000 and
   during longer periods extending back to the late 1950s. However, some
   negative trends were found at extratropical locations. In many cases,
   statistically significant differences were found in trends at paired
   high and low elevation stations, with tropical pairs revealing more
   warming ( and greater increases in freezing-level height) at mountain
   stations than at low elevations. This result is consistent with both the
   observed retreat of tropical glaciers and the minimal change in
   tropics-wide tropospheric temperatures over the past two decades.
   Overall, the analysis suggests that, on diurnal, seasonal, interannual,
   and multidecadal time scales, temperature variations at mountain
   locations differ significantly from those at relatively nearby ( a few
   hundred kilometers) low elevation stations. These differences are
   greatest at the two surface levels, but can persist up to 2 km above the
   mountain site. Therefore, to determine the nature of climate variability
   at high elevation sites requires local observations, since large-scale
   patterns derived from low elevation observations may not be
   representative of the mountain regions. Conversely, temperature change
   in mountain regions should not be viewed as necessarily representative
   of global surface or tropospheric trends.},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity for large areas can only
   be derived from surface-leaving radiation measured by satellite sensors.
   These measurements represent the integrated effect of the surface and
   are, thus, for many applications, superior to point measurements on the
   ground, e.g. in Earth's radiation budget and climate change detection.
   Over the years, a substantial amount of research was dedicated to the
   estimation of LST and emissivity from passive sensor data. This article
   provides the theoretical basis and gives an overview of the current
   status of this research. Sensors operating in the visible, infrared and
   microwave range onboard various meteorological satellites are
   considered, e.g. Metcosat-MVIRI, NOAA-AVHRR, ERS-ATSR, Terra-MODIS,
   Terra-ASTER and DMSP-SSM/I. Atmospheric effects on measured brightness
   temperatures are described and atmospheric corrections using radiative
   transfer models (RTM) are explained. The substitution of RTM with neural
   networks (NN) for faster forward calculations is also discussed. The

Title = {A comparative analysis of temperature trends at Modena Geophysical
   Observatory and Mount Cimone Observatory, Italy},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 25},
Abstract = {Global warming has become a critical environmental, social, and economic
   threat, with increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather
   events. This study aims to analyse temperature trends and climate
   indices in the Po Valley, a significant economic and agricultural region
   in Italy, by examining data from two historical stations: the urban
   Modena Observatory and the rural Mount Cimone Observatory. The analysis
   extends previous studies to 2018, assessing the magnitude of climate
   changes since the 1950s and isolating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect
   in Modena. Significant warming trends were confirmed at both sites, with
   in maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperatures trends nearly doubling
   from 1981 to 2018 compared to 1951-2018. For example, TX trends reached
   0.84 degrees C<middle dot>decade-1 in Modena and 0.62 degrees C<middle
   dot>decade-1 at Mount Cimone, while TN trends were 0.77 and 0.80 degrees
   C<middle dot>decade-1, respectively. Extreme climate indices showed a
   substantial increase in warm days and nights (TX90p and TN90p,
   respectively). Particularly we found TX90p of 27.5 days<middle
   dot>decade-1 in Modena and 15 days<middle dot>decade-1 at Mount Cimone
   while TN90p of 29.5 days<middle dot>decade-1 in Modena, 22 days<middle
   dot>decade-1 at Mount Cimone. The UHI effect significantly impacts
   Modena's temperature trends. Urbanization contributes up to 65\% of the
   rise in warm nights. Specifically, frost days decreased by 1.88
   days<middle dot>decade-1 (37\% of Urban Contribute, UC), tropical nights
   increased by 5.16 days<middle dot>decade-1 (57\% UC), warm nights
   increased by 12.7 days<middle dot>decade-1 (65\% UC), and cool nights
   decreased by 3.19 days<middle dot>decade-1 (39\% UC). Overall, the study
   underscores the importance of considering both global and local factors
   in regional climate trend analysis.
   This paper deals with temperature trend analysis and comparison between
   an urban and a mountain meteorological station in the Po Valley, Italy.
   Results show a notable warming trend for the period 1981-2018 with a not
   negligible contribution of the Urban Heat Island phenomenon. image},

Abstract = {This paper discusses ground temperature responses to climate variations
   in a range of surficial geology units near Kangiqsualujjuaq, Nunavik.
   Sixteen thermistor cables, extending to depths from 2.9 to 20 m, were
   installed in various settings near the community over 35 years. Here we
   examine ground temperature at three contrasting sites: a lithalsa in
   ice-rich marine clays near the shoreline, a glaciofluvial delta (sand
   and gravel), and bedrock (massive gneiss), to compare thermal regimes
   and responses to climatic variations over the last 20 to 30 years. With
   climate warming, the site in marine deposits has become isothermal near
   0 degrees C and the release of latent heat now impedes ground
   temperature responses to climate. In sand and gravel, freeze-back is
   delayed until late in winter with clear development of a zero curtain
   due to formation of a perched water table in the deepened active layer.
   Short-term air temperature variations and regional climatic trends are
   effectively transmitted at depth into highly conductive dry bedrock,
   where active layer depth also readily responds to air temperature
   variations.},

   Relative merits of the estimators and test statistics depend on the
   magnitude of the trend slopes relative to the noise in the data. We make
   specific recommendations for practitioners. We revisit the empirical

Abstract = {The effect of wind on summer water temperature trends in a semi-closed
   bay (Tokyo Bay, Japan) is examined through several numerical experiments
   using a high-resolution three-dimensional ocean model. The model is
   executed under no-wind and uniform southerly/northerly wind conditions,
   and monthly mean currents and temperature distributions and heat
   transport in Tokyo Bay for July are calculated. The model results show
   that wind has a significant effect on heat transport and temperature
   distribution in the bay. (1) When a southerly wind prevails northward
   cool water transport intensifies while southward warm water transport
   declines, thus decreasing the water temperature in the central bay area
   while increasing temperature at the bay head. (2) A northerly wind has
   an opposing effect and decreases the water temperature in coastal bay
   head area while increase the temperature along the southwest coast. The
   results also suggest that the trend of increasing southerly wind
   amplitude may have affected water temperature trends in Tokyo Bay from
   1979 to 1997. The model results demonstrated that the an intensified
   southerly wind lowers water temperatures in most areas of the bay by
   enhancing upwelling and open ocean-water intrusion near the bay mouth
   while increases temperatures in the bottom layer of the bay head by
   suppressing southward warm water transport.},

   Trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {27},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2819-2841},

Abstract = {Century-scale global near-surface temperature trends in response to
   rising greenhouse gas concentrations in climate models vary by almost a
   factor of 2, with greatest intermodel spread in the Arctic region where
   sea ice is a key climate component. Three factors contribute to the
   intermodel spread: 1) model formulation, 2) control climate state, and
   3) internal climate variability. This study focuses on the influence of
   Arctic sea ice in the control climate on the intermodel spread in
   warming, using idealized 1\% yr(-1) CO2 increase simulations of 33
   state-of-the-art global climate models, and combining sea
   ice-temperature relations on local to large spatial scales. On the
   Arctic mean scale, the spread in temperature trends is only weakly
   related to ice volume or area in the control climate, and is probably
   not dominated by internal variability. This suggests that other
   processes, such as ocean heat transport and meteorological conditions,
   play a more important role in the spread of long-term Arctic warming
   than control sea ice conditions. However, on a local scale, sea
   ice-warming relations show that in regions with more sea ice, models
   generally simulate more warming in winter and less warming in summer.
   The local winter warming is clearly related to control sea ice and
   universal among models, whereas summer sea ice-warming relations are
   more diverse, and are probably dominated by differences in model
   formulation. To obtain a more realistic representation of Arctic
   warming, it is recommended to simulate control sea ice conditions in
   climate models so that the spatial pattern is correct.},

Title = {Analysis of spatial variation of temperature trends in the semiarid

Abstract = {This study analyzes the spatial and temporal distribution of trends on
   monthly, seasonal, and annual mean temperatures (1967-2017) at 22
   stations in the Euphrates Basin of Turkey. The recently proposed
   innovative trend analysis (ITA) and the nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK)
   and Spearman's rho (SR) test at 5\% and 1\% significance levels were
   applied to examine the temporal trends of temperatures. Before using the
   nonparametric trend analysis, the serial correlation of the temperature
   data was removed with the pre-whitening (PW) method. Then, MK-Z values
   were mapped in ArcGIS environment using the Empirical Bayesian Kriging
   (EBK) method to reveal the spatial variation of temperature trends. As a
   result, according to the ITA method, increasing temperature trends at
   1\% significance level dominate almost all periods. Based on the MK and
   SR tests, it was identified that increase trends were dominant at 1\%
   and 5\% significance levels in February, March, April, July, August,
   Spring, Summer, and Annual periods. According to the spatial temperature
   trend maps, significant increase trends occupy an important place in
   most of the basin in February, March, April, June, July, August, Spring,
   Summer, Winter, and Annual periods. The study results provide important
   information to water resources managers and decision-makers about the
   regions at significant risk in climate change in the Euphrates Basin.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal variations and trends of SST and Chl-a in the
   Persian Gulf were evaluated using MODIS data from 2002 to 2018. Trend
   indicator and key features were built up based on Mann-Kendall test,
   Hurst exponents and Wavelet Transform (WT) techniques to investigated
   the volatilities, trend estimation and persistence of original and WT
   signals. The key features revealed that the Chl-a pattern is
   heterogeneous in both time and spatial scale, whereas SST pattern is
   more homogenous. Trend analysis of the study area showed identifiable
   and sustainable trend with maximum tendency to decrease of Chl-a, and
   increase of SST. More than 48\% of the study area is under slight
   decrease, and about 20\% area mostly located at the northern parts show
   slight increase of Chl-a values. The presented methodology is applicable
   to the data signals that keep the range of inter-annual approximation

   temperature and salinity in the Bering Strait and nearby water areas are

   Sea is note. There is the summer period +0.12(0)C/decade, in the winter
   period +0.14(0)C/decade. At the same time, there is some trend towards
   decrease in salinity the straight water, this is.0.06psu/decade in the

Title = {Causes of irregularities in trends of global mean surface temperature
   since the late 19th century},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The time series of monthly global mean surface temperature (GST) since
   1891 is successfully reconstructed from known natural and anthropogenic
   forcing factors, including internal climate variability, using a
   multiple regression technique. Comparisons are made with the performance
   of 40 CMIP5 models in predicting GST. The relative contributions of the
   various forcing factors to GST changes vary in time, but most of the
   warming since 1891 is found to be attributable to the net influence of
   increasing greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols. Separate
   statistically independent analyses are also carried out for three
   periods of GST slowdown (1896-1910, 1941-1975, and 1998-2013 and
   subperiods); two periods of strong warming (1911-1940 and 1976-1997) are
   also analyzed. A reduction in total incident solar radiation forcing
   played a significant cooling role over 2001-2010. The only serious
   disagreements between the reconstructions and observations occur during
   the Second World War, especially in the period 1944-1945, when observed
   near-worldwide sea surface temperatures (SSTs) may be significantly
   warm-biased. In contrast, reconstructions of near-worldwide SSTs were
   rather warmer than those observed between about 1907 and 1910. However,
   the generally high reconstruction accuracy shows that known external and
   internal forcing factors explain all the main variations in GST between
   1891 and 2015, allowing for our current understanding of their
   uncertainties. Accordingly, no important additional factors are needed
   to explain the two main warming and three main slowdown periods during
   this epoch.},

Abstract = {An investigation of climatic extreme events presents the valuable
   opportunities to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on
   human activities, agriculture, and economy. These analyses are useful
   procedures in monitoring climate change on a synoptic scale. The present
   study is a trend analysis of the extreme temperature events, which have
   been based on the gridded daily temperatures of Iranian climatic
   database within 1962-2004. The aim of the present study is to identify
   the frequency and intensity of extreme events, which have been increased
   with over Iran in the last four decades. Both the Mann-Kendall trend
   test and simple linear regression were utilized to detect trends in
   annual temperature extremes. The results showed that the frequency of
   hot extreme temperature events has increased over the study area within
   1962-2004, while a negative trend has been observed in the frequency of
   cold extreme temperatures. About 66 \% of the surface area has a
   significant positive trend in frequency of hot days and nights, while
   about 40.9 and 68.5 \% of surface area have a significant decrease in
   frequency of cold days and nights, respectively. The strongest
   increasing tendency is detected in the case of the annual numbers of hot
   nights, warm nights, summer days, warm days, and the heat wave duration

Abstract = {We examine the possibility that anthropogenic forcing (Greenhouse gases
   and Sulfate aerosols, GS) is a plausible explanation for the observed
   near-surface temperature trends over the Mediterranean area. For this
   purpose, we compare annual and seasonal observed trends in near-surface
   temperature over the period from 1980 to 2009 with the response to GS
   forcing estimated from 23 models derived from CMIP3 database. We find
   that there is less than a 5\% chance that natural (internal) variability
   is responsible for the observed annual and seasonal area-mean warming
   except in winter. Using additionally two pattern similarity statistics,
   pattern correlation and regression, we find that the large-scale
   component (spatial-mean) of the GS signal is detectable (at 2.5\% level)
   in all seasons except in winter. In contrast, we fail to detect the
   small-scale component (spatial anomalies about the mean) of GS signal in
   observed trend patterns. Further, we find that the recent trends are
   significantly (at 2.5\% level) consistent with all the 23 GS patterns,
   except in summer and spring, when 9 and 5 models respectively
   underestimate the observed warming. Thus, we conclude that GS forcing is
   a plausible explanation for the observed warming in the Mediterranean
   region. Consistency of observed trends with climate change projections
   indicates that present trends may be understood of what will come more
   so in the future, allowing for a better communication of the societal
   challenges to meet in the future.},

Abstract = {We evaluated long-term trend,, in average maximum and minimum
   temperatures. threshold temperatures, and growing season in eastern
   Colorado. USA. to explore the potential shortcomings of many
   climate-change studies that either: ( 1) generalize regional patterns
   from single station,,. single seasons. or a few parameters over short
   duration from averaging dissimilar stations: or (2) generalize an a
   average regional pattern from coarse-scale general circulation models.
   Based on I I weather stations, some trends Acre weakly regionally
   consistent with previous studies of night-time temperature warming.
   Long-term (80 + year,,) mean minimum temperatures increased
   significantly ( P < 0.2) in about half the stations in winter. spring.
   and autumn and six Stations had significant decreases in the number of
   days per year with temperatures less than or equal to - 17.8 C (less
   than or equal to0 F), However, spatial and temporal variation in the
   direction of change as enormous for all the other weather parameters
   tested. and, in the majority of tests, few stations showed significant
   trend, (even at P < 0.2). n summer. four stations had significant
   increases and three stations had significant decreases in minimum
   temperature,,,. producing a strongly mixed regional signal, Trend,, in
   maximum temperature varied seasonally and geographically, as did trends
   in threshold temperature days greater than or equal to32.2 C (greater
   than or equal to90 F) or days greater than or equal to37.8 C (greater
   than or equal to100 F). There was evidence of a subregional cooling in
   autumn's maximum temperature,,, with five stations showing significant
   decreasing trends. There were many geographic anomalies where
   neighbouring weather stations differed greatly in the magnitude of
   change or where they had significant and opposite trends. We conclude
   that sub-regional spatial and seasonal variation cannot be ignored when
   evaluating the direction and magnitude of climate change, It is unlikely
   that one or a few weather stations are representative of regional
   climate trends. and equally unlikely that regionally projected climate
   change from coarse-scale general circulation models will accurately
   portray trends at sub-regional scales. However. the assessment of a
   group of stations for consistent more qualitative trend, (Such as the
   number of days less than -17.8 degreesC, such as we found) provides a
   reasonably robust procedure to evaluate climate trends and variability.

Abstract = {Closed cell polyurethane foams now constitute the major use of F-11
   which is a relatively recent occurrence. The residence time of F-11 in
   various types of polyurethane foams is extremely long, probably more
   than a hundred years. Because of the long residence time, polyurethane
   foams constitute a significant and growing reservoir of F-11 from which
   the fluorocarbon will leak out into the atmosphere at increasing rates
   for a very long time. The temporal behavior of the emission rate of F-11
   is  characterized by slow, relatively constant emission rates once the
   effects of cutting the foam have subsided. Bruising or breaking the
   polyurethane foams can release large amounts of F-11. There is
   considerable variability in the averge emission rates between foams made
   by different manufacturers (.apprx. 400\%) but very little variability
   in average emission rates from samples of the same larger piece of foam
   (.ltoreq. 20\%). Consequently the residence time of F-11 is different
   for foams from different  manufacturers, but in all cases the residence
   time is very long. Emission rates increase rapidly with increasing
   temperature at an average rate of about 5\% per degree F in the
   temperature range between 70.degree. F and 80.degree. F. In actural
   applications the temperature may be an important determinant of the
   residence time of F-11 in polyurethane foams.},

Title = {Hurricane track trends and environmental flow patterns under surface
   temperature changes and roughness length variations},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {43},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Given the significant damage that hurricanes can cause every year,
   accurate forecasts of these extreme weather events are crucial. Ocean
   warming can substantially impact the intensity and track of hurricanes
   in the future. Forecasting the track of hurricanes is typically more
   challenging than intensity predictions since tracks are influenced not
   only by hurricane vortex dynamics but also by global and synoptic
   weather systems (i.e., environmental flow). The dynamical mechanisms
   that modulate hurricane trajectories under changes in the surface
   temperature and friction are not comprehensively established yet. The
   primary objective of this paper is to address this knowledge gap by
   conducting six real hurricanes and some non-hurricane simulations using
   the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In total, 90 WRF
   simulations are carried out to characterize the impacts of varying the
   surface temperature and drag on hurricane tracks and their relationship
   with environmental flow patterns. It is found that ocean warming tends
   to intensify hurricanes by similar to 20 \% and decrease their azimuthal
   translational velocity, and vice versa when the surface is cooled.
   Hurricanes move more towards the west over the Atlantic Ocean when the
   surface temperature is decreased and vice versa. This was shown to be
   due to the changes in the average azimuthal speed of environmental
   flows. Increasing the surface temperature, destabilizes the atmosphere,
   and increases the surface friction velocity. Hence, increased surface
   friction appears to slow down the environmental flow and consequently
   hurricane track azimuthal translational speed. This finding was
   confirmed by another suite of simulations in which only the surface
   roughness length of the low-wind environmental flow regime was altered.
   It was shown that surface drag changes have a similar impact on
   hurricane tracks as surface temperature variations. Decreasing the
   default surface drag for low-wind regimes tends to further move the
   hurricanes toward the west and vice versa. This paper provides notable
   insights into future hurricane track trends and the role of ocean
   temperature and momentum exchange coefficients in hurricane track and
   environmental flow patterns. Moreover, the results of this study can be
   useful for advancing surface layer parameterizations and their impacts
   on hurricane track forecasts in weather/climate models.},

Abstract = {Stratospheric temperature trends for the period 2002-2014 have been
   estimated using NOAA's Integrated Microwave Inter-calibration Approach
   (IMICA) version of advanced microwave sounding unit (AMSU) on AQUA
   satellite. In this period the stratosphere continued cooling over most
   of the globe with a rate ranging from -0.4 0.3 to -0.5 0.4K/decade above
   25km. Considering specific latitude bands, trends are highly variable
   with height. In the tropical region, trends vary from -0.5 0.3K/decade
   for channel 12 (approximate to 30km) to -0.7 0.3K/decade for higher
   channels and present small seasonal variability in the intensity of
   cooling. In the polar regions and in the midlatitudes, trends for all
   channels are negative but not significant; uncertainties are large due
   to the high dynamical variability particularly in high latitudes. There
   is also large seasonal variability, with southern midlatitudes seasonal
   trends significant during summer (December, January, February) and
   autumn (March, April, May) above approximate to 25km, with values
   ranging from -1.0 +/- 0.5 to -0.6 +/- 0.5K/decade. Regional trends
   estimated with AMSU and long-term lidar measurements (over two decades)
   confirm stratospheric cooling in the northern midlatitudes and tropical
   regions. The effect of the length of the short series on trends was
   found to be small outside polar regions. It was found to be large in
   polar regions with about 1K changes in trend depending on start dates of
   the time series.},

   Temperature Trends in CMIP5 Simulations},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The tropospheric and stratospheric temperature trends and uncertainties
   in the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model
   simulations in the period of 1979-2005 have been compared with satellite
   observations. The satellite data include those from the Stratospheric
   Sounding Units (SSU), Microwave Sounding Units (MSU), and the Advanced
   Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU). The results show that the CMIP5 model
   simulations reproduced the common stratospheric cooling (-0.46--0.95
   K/decade) and tropospheric warming (0.05-0.19 K/decade) features
   although a significant discrepancy was found among the individual models
   being selected. The changes of global mean temperature in CMIP5
   simulations are highly consistent with the SSU measurements in the
   stratosphere, and the temporal correlation coefficients between
   observation and model simulations vary from 0.6-0.99 at the 99\%
   confidence level. At the same time, the spread of temperature mean in
   CMIP5 simulations increased from stratosphere to troposphere. Multiple
   linear regression analysis indicates that the temperature variability in
   the stratosphere is dominated by radioactive gases, volcanic events and
   solar forcing. Generally, the high-top models show better agreement with
   observations than the low-top model, especially in the lower
   stratosphere. The CMIP5 simulations underestimated the stratospheric
   cooling in the tropics and overestimated the cooling over the Antarctic
   compared to the satellite observations. The largest spread of
   temperature trends in CMIP5 simulations is seen in both the Arctic and
   Antarctic areas, especially in the stratospheric Antarctic.},

Abstract = {Over the last 15 years, global mean surface temperatures exhibit only
   weak trends. Recent studies have attempted to attribute this so called
   temperature hiatus to several causes, amongst them incomplete sampling
   of the rapidly warming Arctic region. We here examine zonal mean
   temperature trends in satellite-based tropospheric data sets (based on
   data from (Advanced) Microwave Sounding Unit and Global Navigation
   Satellite System Radio Occultation instruments) and in global surface
   temperatures (HadCRUT4). Omission of successively larger polar regions
   from the global mean temperature calculations, in both tropospheric and
   surface data sets, shows that data gaps at high latitudes cannot explain
   the observed differences between the hiatus and the prehiatus period.
   Instead, the dominating causes of the global temperature hiatus are
   found at low latitudes. The combined use of several independent data
   sets, representing completely different measurement techniques and
   sampling characteristics, strengthens the conclusions.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {Temperature trends over 1979-2008 in the U.S. Historical Climatology
   Network (HCN) are compared with those in six recent atmospheric
   reanalyses. For the conterminous United States, the trend in the
   adjusted HCN (0.327 degrees C dec(-1)) is generally comparable to the
   ensemble mean of the reanalyses (0.342 degrees C dec(-1)). It is also
   well within the range of the reanalysis trend estimates (0.280 to 0.437
   degrees C dec(-1)). The bias adjustments play a critical role, as the
   raw HCN dataset displays substantially less warming than all of the
   reanalyses. HCN has slightly lower maximum and minimum temperature
   trends than those reanalyses with hourly temporal resolution, suggesting
   the HCN adjustments may not fully compensate for recent non-climatic
   artifacts at some stations. Spatially, both the adjusted HCN and all of
   the reanalyses indicate widespread warming across the nation during the
   study period. Overall, the adjusted HCN is in broad agreement with the
   suite of reanalyses. Citation: Vose, R. S., S. Applequist, M. J. Menne,

Title = {Trends in Atmospheric Humidity and Temperature above Dome C, Antarctica
   Evaluated from Observations and Reanalyses},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The time evolution of humidity and temperature above Dome C (Antarctica)
   has been investigated by considering data from (1) meteorological
   radiosondes (2005-2017), (2) the microwave radiometer HAMSTRAD
   (2012-2017), (3) four modern meteorological reanalyses (1980-2017) and
   (4) the southern annular mode (SAM) index (1980-2017). From these
   observations (2005-2017), a significant moistening trend (0.08 +/- 0.06
   kg m(-2)dec(-1)) is associated with a significant warming trend (1.08
   +/- 0.55 K dec(-1)) in summer. Conversely, a significant drying trend of
   -0.04 +/- 0.03 kg m(-2)dec(-1)(-0.05 +/- 0.03 kg m(-2)dec(-1)) is
   associated with a significant cooling trend of -2.4 +/- 1.2 K
   dec(-1)(-5.1 +/- 2.0 K dec(-1)) in autumn (winter), with no significant
   trends in the spring. We demonstrate that 1) the trends identified in
   the radiosondes (2005-2017) are also present in the reanalyses and 2)
   the multidecadal variability of integrated water vapor and near-surface
   temperature (1980-2017) is strongly influenced by variability in the SAM
   index for all seasons but spring. Our study suggests that the decadal
   trends observed in humidity and near-surface temperature at Dome C
   (2005-2017) reflect the multidecadal variability of the atmosphere, and
   are not indicative of long-term trends that may be related to global
   climate change.},

Title = {Updating temperature and salinity mean values and trends in the Western
   Mediterranean: The RADMED project},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {27-46},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The RADMED project is devoted to the implementation and maintenance of a
   multidisciplinary monitoring system around the Spanish Mediterranean
   waters. This observing system is based on periodic multidisciplinary
   cruises covering the coastal waters, continental shelf and slope waters
   and some deep stations (> 2000 m) from the Westernmost Alboran Sea to
   Barcelona in the Catalan Sea, including the Balearic Islands. This
   project was launched in 2007 unifying and extending some previous
   monitoring projects which had a more reduced geographical coverage. Some
   of the time series currently available extend from 1992, while the more
   recent ones were initiated in 2007. The present work updates the
   available time series up to 2015 (included) and shows the capability of
   these time series for two main purposes: the calculation of mean values
   for the properties of main water masses around the Spanish
   Mediterranean, and the study of the interannual and decadal variability
   of such properties. The data set provided by the RADMED project has been
   merged with historical data from the MEDAR/MEDATLAS data base for the
   calculation of temperature and salinity trends from 1900 to 2015. The
   analysis of these time series shows that the intermediate and deep
   layers of the Western Mediterranean have increased their temperature and
   salinity with an acceleration of the warming and salting trends from
   1943. Trends for the heat absorbed by the water column for the 1943-2015
   period, range between 0.2 and 0.6 W/m(2) depending on the used
   methodology. The temperature and salinity trends for the same period and
   for the intermediate layer are 0.002 degrees C/yr and 0.001 yr(-1)
   respectively. Deep layers warmed and increased their salinity at a rate
   of 0.004 degrees C/yr and 0.001 yr(-1).},

   Low-frequency modes of atmospheric variability for spring and autumn are

Abstract = {Day-to-day temperature variability is investigated in eight European
   series of daily mean temperatures beginning between 1722 and 1833. Eight
   statistical measures of day-to-day temperature variability are compared.
   The intramonthly standard deviation of daily temperature anomalies is
   found to be a good measure. The absolute change in temperature anomaly
   from one day to the next is sensitive to changes in observational
   procedures and is suggested as a diagnostic tool for identification of
   inhomogeneities in instrumental temperature series. Because many changes
   in observational procedures have taken place, quantitative estimates of
   trends in day-to-day variability, based on all series, could only be
   calculated for 1880-1998. A trend analysis over this period indicates an
   increase by 5\% in southwest Europe, 0 to -5\% change in the northwest,
   and a decrease by 5 to 10\% in northeast Europe. On a longer time
   perspective, day-to-day temperature variability in winter, spring, and
   autumn in northern Europe has decreased over the last 200-250 years. The
   frequency of extremely cold wister days in northern Europe was lower in
   the twentieth century than in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
   Day-to-day temperature variability in winter in northern Europe was
   negatively correlated with a North Atlantic Oscillation index in the
   period 1826-1997, but some other factor must also have contributed to
   the long-term variability decrease. More long daily temperature series,
   and development of homogenization methods for such data, are needed for
   an improved knowledge of long-term changes in day-to-day temperature
   variability.},

Title = {Pre-seasonal temperature trend break dominating the trend break in
   autumn grassland phenology in China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {125},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Interannual variations in the end of the growing season (EOS) play a
   crucial role in assessing carbon and energy cycling within grassland
   ecosystems. Previous studies have often fixed the trend breakpoint in
   autumn phenology around the year 2000 to examine the response of the
   vegetation EOS to long-term climate change. However, the asymmetry of
   climate change and the diversity of grass species may lead to spatial
   disparities in EOS trend breakpoints, but little research has been done
   to quantify their characteristics and underlying climatic driving
   mechanisms. Focusing on the period from 1982 to 2015, this study
   extracts EOS data from six different grassland subregions in China to
   identify EOS trend breakpoints, and then investigates the associated
   climatic driving mechanisms. The results highlight the presence of
   significant breakpoints in the EOS trend within 54.1\% of China's
   grasslands. Prior to 1997, the grassland EOS trend exhibited a
   pronounced delay, with a rate of 0.29 days per year (P < 0.01), which
   subsequently shifted to 0.10 days per year. In addition, pre-seasonal
   climate factors emerged as the dominant driver, contributing a
   remarkable 98.8\% to the timing of the grassland EOS, with preseasonal
   temperature and solar radiation standing out as the dominant climate
   variables influencing the grassland EOS. Furthermore, the main driver of
   the trend break in the grassland EOS was the trend break in preseasonal
   temperature, which contributed to 52.2\% of the trend break in the
   grassland EOS. These results confirm the presence of breakpoints in the
   autumn phenological trend across Chinese grasslands, and elucidate the
   intrinsic climate-driven mechanism responsible for the autumn
   phenological trend break at the pixel scale. These findings provide
   valuable insights to better understand and model the complex
   interactions between ecosystems and the climate system.},

Title = {Analyzing Error Bounds for Seasonal-Trend Decomposition of Antarctica
   Temperature Time Series Involving Missing Data},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of extracting trends from time
   series data involving missing values. In particular, we investigate a
   general class of procedures that impute the missing data and then
   extract trends using seasonal-trend decomposition based on loess (STL),
   where loess stands for locally weighted smoothing, a popular tool for
   describing the regression relationship between two variables by a smooth
   curve. We refer to them as the imputation-STL procedures. Two results
   are obtained in this paper. First, we settle a theoretical issue, namely
   the connection between imputation error and the overall error from
   estimating the trend. Specifically, we derive the bounds for the overall
   error in terms of the imputation error. This subsequently facilitates
   the error analysis of any imputation-STL procedure and justifies its use
   in practice. Second, we investigate loess-STL, a particular
   imputation-STL procedure with the imputation also being performed using
   loess. Through both theoretical arguments and simulation results, we
   show that loess-STL has the capacity of handling a high proportion of
   missing data and providing reliable trend estimates if the underlying
   trend is smooth and the missing data are dispersed over the time series.
   In addition to mathematical derivations and simulation study, we apply
   our loess-STL procedure to profile radiosonde records of upper air
   temperature at 22 Antarctic research stations covering the past 50
   years. For purpose of illustration, we present in this paper only the
   results for Novolazaravskaja station which has temperature records with
   more than 8.4\% dispersed missing values at 8 pressure levels from
   October/1969 to March/2011.},

Title = {Half a century of coastal temperature records reveal complex warming
   trends in western boundary currents},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 6},
Abstract = {Accelerated warming of western boundary currents due to the
   strengthening of subtropical gyres has had cascading effects on coastal
   ecosystems and is widely expected to result in further tropicalization
   of temperate regions. Predicting how species and ecosystems will respond
   requires a better understanding of the variability in ocean warming in
   complex boundary current regions. Using three >= 50 year temperature
   records we demonstrate high variability in the magnitude and seasonality
   of warming in the Southwest Pacific boundary current region. The
   greatest rate of warming was evident off eastern Tasmania (0.20 degrees
   C decade-1), followed by southern New Zealand (0.10 degrees C decade-1),
   while there was no evidence of annual warming in northeastern New
   Zealand. This regional variability in coastal warming was also evident
   in the satellite record and is consistent with expected changes in
   regional-scale circulation resulting from increased wind stress curl in
   the South Pacific subtropical gyre. Warming trends over the satellite
   era (1982-2016) were considerably greater than the longer-term trends,
   highlighting the importance of long-term temperature records in
   understanding climate change in coastal regions. Our findings
   demonstrate the spatial and temporal complexity of warming patterns in
   boundary current regions and challenge widespread expectations of
   tropicalization in temperate regions under future climate change.},

Abstract = {Drought causes great losses in regional agricultural production and
   decreases socioeconomic growth. The vegetation temperature condition
   index (VTCI) has a distinct advantage in monitoring the onset, duration,
   and intensity of droughts. With the development of modern remote sensing
   technologies, remotely sensed data with variable spatial and temporal
   resolution are used to generate multiscale maps of droughts. Therefore,
   understanding the scale effect and developing appropriate up-scaling
   methods to retrieve spatiotemporal drought variables across different
   scales is valuable. As an alternative to the commonly used window
   averaging (WA) method, we develop the trend surface analysis (TSA)
   method based on multiple regression analysis to up-scale Landsat-derived
   VTCI (Landsat-VTCI) images from a finer to a coarser resolution. The two
   methods are systematically evaluated in a case study according to
   various statistical indicators, including the spatial and frequency
   distributions of features, and the correlation coefficients and root
   mean square errors between up-scaled Landsat-VTCI images and
   moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived VTCI
   (MODIS-VTCI) images. The results show that TSA is reliable and more
   suitable than WA for non-normally distributed Landsat-derived VTCIs,
   whereas the WA results are similar to the TSA results for normal
   distributions. The TSA method is flexible for any type of distribution
   of Landsat-VTCIs within a study area and can be programmed to up-scale
   spatial drought variables from a finer to a coarser spatial resolution
   because of its efficiency and flexibility compared to the WA method.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to calculate the descriptive statistics
   to characterize the climatology of minimum air temperature at 5 cm over
   short grass (Tmr) in Santa Maria, RS. A further objective was to
   associate the interannual variability of Tmr with the ENSO phenomenon
   and also to verify if there is a trend in the historical series for this
   meteorological variable. Data used in this study were daily minimum air
   temperature over short grass measured at the Meteorological Station in
   Santa Maria, RS, Brazil (29 degrees 43'S, 53 degrees 43'W and altitude
   of 95 m) from 1(st) May 1970 to 31 December 2009. Years were grouped in
   El Nino, La Nina, and Neutral years, from 1(st) July to 30 June. Mean
   monthly minimum air temperature varied from 6.9 degrees C in July to
   17.3 degrees C in January, with the lowest value of -8.4 degrees C in
   June and the highest value of 28.6 degrees C in October. There is an
   ENSO signal on the minimum air temperature over short grass during the

Abstract = {We use several variants of the detrended fluctuation analysis to study
   the appearance of long-term persistence in temperature records, obtained
   at 95 stations all over the globe. Our results basically confirm earlier
   studies. We find that the persistence, characterized by the correlation
   C(s) of temperature variations separated by s days, decays for large s
   as a power law, C(s)similar tos(-gamma). For continental stations,
   including stations along the coastlines, we find that gamma is always
   close to 0.7. For stations on islands, we find that gamma ranges between
   0.3 and 0.7, with a maximum at gamma=0.4. This is consistent with
   earlier studies of the persistence in sea surface temperature records
   where gamma is close to 0.4. In all cases, the exponent gamma does not
   depend on the distance of the stations to the continental coastlines. By
   varying the degree of detrending in the fluctuation analysis we obtain
   also information about trends in the temperature records.},

Abstract = {Monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures for over 50\% (10\%) of
   the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere landmass, accounting for 37\% of the
   global landmass, indicate that the rise of the minimum temperature has
   occurred at a rate three times that of the maximum temperature during
   the period 1951-90 (0.84-degrees-C versus 0.28-degrees-C). The decrease
   of the diurnal temperature range is approximately equal to the increase
   of mean temperature. The asymmetry is detectable in all seasons and in
   most of the regions studied.
   The decrease in the daily temperature range is partially related to
   increases in cloud cover. Furthermore, a large number of atmospheric and
   surface boundary conditions are shown to differentially affect the
   maximum and minimum temperature. Linkages of the observed changes in the
   diurnal temperature range to large-scale climate forcings, such as
   anthropogenic increases in sulfate aerosols, greenhouse gases, or
   biomass burning (smoke), remain tentative. Nonetheless, the observed
   decrease of the diurnal temperature range is clearly important, both
   scientifically and practically.},

   degradation of persistent organic pollutants},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {468},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The daunting effects of persistent organic pollutants on humans,
   animals, and the environment cannot be overemphasized. Their fate,
   persistence, long-range transport, and bioavailability have made them an
   environmental stressor of concern which has attracted the interest of
   the research community. Concerted efforts have been made by relevant
   organizations utilizing legislative laws to ban their production and get
   rid of them completely for the sake of public health. However, they have
   remained refractive in different compartments of the environment. Their
   bioavailability is majorly a function of different anthropogenic
   activities. Landfilling and incineration are among the earliest
   classical means of environmental remediation of waste; however, they are
   not sustainable due to the seepage of contaminants in landfills, the
   release of toxic gases into the atmosphere and energy requirements
   during incineration. Other advanced waste destruction technologies have
   been explored for the degradation of these recalcitrant pollutants;
   although, some are efficient, but are limited by high amounts of energy
   consumption, the use of organic solvents and hazardous chemicals, high
   capital and operational cost, and lack of public trust. Thus, this study
   has systematically reviewed different contaminant degradation
   technologies, their efficiency, and feasibility. Finally, based on
   techno-economic feasibility, non-invasiveness, efficiency, and
   environmental friendliness; radiation technology can be considered a
   viable alternative for the environmental remediation of contaminants in
   all environmental matrices at bench-, pilot-, and industrial-scale.},

Abstract = {Viewed from the continental or hemispheric perspective, the evidence of
   warming trends in surface temperatures continues to accumulate. Here. we
   focus on the detection of seasonal temperature trends at regional and
   sub-regional space scales. The study region is transnational, extending
   from the border areas of New Mexico and Texas in the USA, southward into
   the altiplano of north central Mexico. The analysis considers maximum
   and minimum temperature records (1941-2000) from 21 stations located in
   a variety of land-use environments ranging from large urban settings to
   rural areas. The analysis demonstrates that a significant part of the
   variability in minimum temperatures for stations located in large urban
   areas is captured by positive linear trend, and thus is likely
   associated with rapid urbanization within the region. A similar, but
   comparatively minor, urban effect is also apparent in the maximum
   temperature records for the warm season (June-September). Aside from the
   urban influence, the most consistent feature emerging from the analysis
   is the tendency for station records to exhibit a recent (post - 1970)
   warming trend. It is present across all place sizes, i.e. from large
   urban to rural stations, and is particularly pronounced for cool- and
   warm-season minimum temperatures and for warm-season maximum
   temperatures. This behaviour generally mirrors the temperature trends
   detected on continental and hemispheric space scales, and thus the onset
   of this warming regime is broadly consistent with documented changes in
   large-scale climate modes such as the North Atlantic oscillation and the
   Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation. Copyright (C) 2063 Royal

Abstract = {We have applied the standard wavelet and the adaptive wavelet transform
   algorithms to the record of the Central England Temperature (GET) from
   1659-1990. Peaks in the CET spectra include 7.5 +/- 1.0 yr, 14.4 +/- 1.0
   yr, 23.5 +/- 2.0 yr, as well as a previously unreported variation at 102
   +/- 15 yr, Our wavelet analysis of CET agrees with previous results from
   Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) by Plaut et al. {[}1995] and gives
   additional results of variability on longer timescales. The interdecadal
   and century-scale variability in CET is strongly dependent on the
   interval of analysis. Estimates of a data trend are also shown to be
   sensitive to the cutoff timescale of the filter. A cooling of
   approximate to 0.3 degrees C during 1659-1720 is found relative to the
   temperatures during the 1800s. The complex time dependence of the actual
   data cautions against using model-derived representations of natural
   variability on such long timescales.},

Abstract = {The study analyzes the long-term average annual OH{*} temperature trend,
   the values of which were obtained from nighttime spectral measurements
   of hydroxyl airglow bands at Zvenigorod research station (56 degrees N,
   37 degrees E) from 1957 to 2022. At present, this OH{*} temperature
   series, which reflects the thermal state of the mesopause region, is the
   longest in the world. On its basis, the linear trend and response of
   temperature to changes in solar activity are estimated both in general
   for the entire data set and for individual time intervals. In the first
   case, the trend was -0.23 +/- 0.04 K/year. In the second case, the
   analysis showed a strong cooling in the mesopause region (-0.53 +/- 0.34
   K/yr) until the 1970s, which subsequently slowed to -0.14 +/- 0.03 K/yr.
   Comparison of the results with other measurements and model calculations
   shows that the latter have lower trend values. It is suggested that the
   causes of the temperature trend, in addition to the increase in
   greenhouse gases, the main one being CO2, can be due to long-term
   changes in the dynamics of the upper atmosphere.},

   Prior analysis of air temperature indices in Ireland had focused on the
   period since the second half of the 20th century, where digital data
   were readily available. Earlier estimations of long-term air temperature
   trends in Ireland focused on non-homogenised data from a small network
   of stations. For this research, 11 long-term (1885-2018) maximum and
   minimum air temperature series were analysed to assess seasonal and
   annual trends and construct extreme air temperature indices in Ireland.
   The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was employed to test the
   statistical significance of the maximum and minimum air temperatures and
   indices trends (p < 0.05). Significant increasing trends were assessed
   in the seasonal and annual maximum and minimum air temperature series in
   Ireland, with greater increases in the spring and autumn seasons.
   Significant increasing trends were determined in the warm days (+6.8
   days), warm nights (+7.5 nights), warm spell duration index (+3.9 days),
   growing season length (+22 days), coldest night (+2.7 ?) and coldest day
   (+1.5 ?) in the period 1885-2018 in Ireland. In the same period,
   significant decreasing trends were identified in the cold days (-9.3
   days), cold nights (-7 nights), frost days (-13.7 days), cold spell
   duration index (-6.9 days) and diurnal air temperature range (-0.1 ?) in
   Ireland. The results follow global patterns presented in the Six
   Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The
   findings of this research will be crucial to assist stakeholders and
   policymakers in defining climate action, adaptation and mitigation plans
   in response to shifting trends in air temperature extremes.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of climatic variables on different spatial and temporal
   scales has been of great concern during the past century because of the
   attention given to global climate change by the scientific community. In
   this study, trends of the annual and seasonal relative humidity and dew
   point temperature time series have been investigated for 15 stations all
   over Bangladesh during 1961-2010. The magnitude of the climatic trends
   was derived from the slopes of the Sen's estimator. The statistical
   significance of the trends was determined by means of the Mann-Kendall
   test. Pre-whitening was used to eliminate the influence of serial
   correlation on the Mann-Kendall test. The percentage of stations showing
   a significant trend is moderate in the case of relative humidity, but is
   a lot higher in dew point temperature series at the 95 \% confidence
   limit. On average, relative humidity is increasing at 0.53, 0.86, and
   1.18 \% per decade on annual, winter, and pre-monsoon (summer) scales,
   respectively, in the western part of the country. Significant negative
   trends of relative humidity series are apparent in monsoon season. On
   the other hand, there is no significant decreasing trend in both annual
   and seasonal dew point temperature time series at any station. Again, a
   higher magnitude of the significant trends is observed in the western
   part of the country. The majority of the slopes are above zero,
   indicating an increasing nature in annual and seasonal dew point
   temperatures over Bangladesh. This warming of dew point temperature in
   Bangladesh is analogous to the global trend.},

Abstract = {Based on daily temperature data from an urban station and four rural
   stations of Shijiazhuang area in Hebei Province, North China, we
   analyzed the trends of extreme temperature indices series of the urban
   station (Shijiazhuang station) and rural stations during 1962-2011 and
   the urbanization effect on the extreme temperature indices of the urban
   station. The results showed that the trends of annual extreme
   temperature indices of the urban station and the rural stations are
   significantly different in the recent 50 years. Urbanization effect on
   the long-term trends of hot days, cold days, frost days, diurnal
   temperature range (DTR), extreme maximum temperature, and extreme
   minimum temperature at the urban station were all statistically
   significant, reaching 1.10 days/10 years, -2.30 days/10 years, -2.55
   days/10 years, -0.20 A degrees C/10 years, 0.16 A degrees C/10 years,
   and 0.70 A degrees C/10 years, respectively, with the urbanization
   contributions to the overall trends reaching 100, 38.0, 42.2, 40.0,
   94.1, and 47.0 \%, respectively. The urbanization effect on trend of ice
   days was also significant, reaching -0.47 days/10 years. However, no
   significant urbanization effect on trends of minimum values of maximum
   temperature and maximum values of minimum temperature had been detected.
   The urbanization effects in the DTR and extreme minimum temperature
   series of Shijiazhuang station in wintertime were highly significant.},

Abstract = {In this study we review a global set of alkenone- and foraminiferal
   Mg/Ca-derived sea surface temperatures (SST) records from the Holocene
   and compare them with a suite of published Eemian SST records based on
   the same approach For the Holocene, the alkenone SST records belong to
   the actualized GHOST database (Kim, J.-H Schneider R.R., (2004) GHOST
   global database for alkenone-derived Holocene sea-surface temperature
   records. Available from. http.//www pangaea de/Projects/GHOST.), while
   the Mg/Ca-derived SST database represents a new compilation The
   actualized GHOST database not only confirms the SST changes previously
   described but also documents the Holocene temperature evolution in new
   oceanic regions such as the Northwestern Atlantic, the eastern
   equatorial Pacific, and the Southern Ocean A comparison of Holocene SST
   records stemming front the two commonly applied paleothermometry methods
   reveals contrasting - sometimes divergent - SST evolution, particularly
   at low latitudes where SST records are abundant enough to infer
   systematic discrepancies at a regional scale Opposite SST trends at
   particular locations could be explained by out-of-phase trends in
   seasonal Insolation during the Holocene. This hypothesis assumes that a
   strong contrast in the ecological responses of coccolithophores and
   planktonic foraminifera to winter and summer oceanographic conditions is
   the ultimate reason for seasonal differences in the origin of the
   temperature signal provided by these organisms. As a simple test for
   this hypothesis, Eemian SST records are considered because the Holocene
   and Eemian time periods experienced comparable changes in orbital
   configurations, but had a higher magnitude in Insolation variance during
   the Eemian For several regions, SST changes during both interglacials
   were of a similar sign, but with higher magnitudes during the Eemian as
   compared to the Holocene This observation suggests that the ecological
   mechanism shaping SST trends during the Holocene was comparable during
   the penultimate interglacial period Although this ``ecology
   hypothesis{''} fails to explain all of the available results, we argue
   that any other mechanism would fail to satisfactorily explain the
   observed SST discrepancies among proxies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All

Title = {Microbial source tracking (MST) in Chattahoochee River National
   Recreation Area: Seasonal and precipitation trends in MST marker
   concentrations, and associations with <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> levels,
   pathogenic marker presence, and land use},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {171},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Escherichia coli levels in recreational waters are often used to predict
   when fecal-associated pathogen levels are a human health risk. The reach
   of the Chattahoochee River that flows through the Chattahoochee River
   National Recreation Area (CRNRA), located in the Atlanta-metropolitan
   area, is a popular recreation area that frequently exceeds the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency beach action value (BAV) for E. coli. A
   BacteriALERT program has been implemented to provide real-time E. coli
   estimates in the reach and notify the public of potentially harmful
   levels of fecal-associated pathogens as indicated by surrogate models
   based on real-time turbidity measurements from continuous water quality
   monitoring stations. However, E. coli does not provide information about
   the sources of fecal contamination and its accuracy as a human health
   indicator is questionable when sources of contamination are non-human.
   The objectives of our study were to investigate, within the Park and
   surrounding watersheds, seasonal and precipitation-related patterns in
   microbial source tracking marker concentrations of possible sources
   (human, dog, and ruminant), assess correlations between source
   contamination levels and culturable E. coli levels, determine which
   sources best explained model-based E. coli estimates above the BAV and
   detection of esp2 (a marker for the esp gene associated with pathogenic
   strains of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis), and
   investigate associations between source contamination levels and land
   use features. Three BacteriALERT sites on the Chattahoochee River were
   sampled six times per season in the winter and summer from December 2015
   through September 2017, and 11 additional stream sites (synoptic sites)
   from the CRNRA watershed were sampled once per season. Samples were
   screened with microbial source tracking (MST) quantitative PCR (qPCR)
   markers for humans (HF183 Taqman), dogs (DogBact), and ruminants
   (Rum2Bac), the esp2 qPCR marker, and culturable E. coli. At the
   BacteriALERT sites, HF183 Taqman concentrations were higher under wet
   conditions DogBact concentrations were greater in the winter and under
   wet conditions, and Rum2Bac concentrations were comparatively low
   throughout the study with no difference across seasons or precipitation
   conditions. Concentrations of HF183 Taqman, DogBact, and Rum2Bac were
   positively correlated with culturable E. coli concentrations; however,
   DogBact had the largest R-2 value among the three markers, and the
   forward stepwise regression indicated it was the best predictor of
   culturable E. coli concentrations at the BacteriALERT sites. Recursive
   partitioning indicated that BAV exceedances of model-based E. coli
   estimates were best explained by DogBact concentrations >= 3 gene copies
   per mL (CN/mL). Detections of esp2 at BacteriALERT sites were best
   explained by DogBact concentrations >= 11 CN/mL, while detections of
   esp2 at synoptic sites were best explained by HF183 Taqman >= 29 CN/mL.
   At the synoptic sites, HF183 Taqman levels were associated with
   wastewater treatment plant density. However, this relationship was
   driven primarily by a single site, suggesting possible conveyance issues
   in that catchment. esp2 detections at synoptic sites were positively
   associated with development within a 2-km radius and negatively
   associated with development within the catchment, suggesting multiple
   sources of esp2 in the watershed. DogBact and Rum2Bac were not
   associated with the land use features included in our analyses.
   Implications for Park management include: 1) fecal contamination levels
   were highest during wet conditions and in the off season when fewer
   visitors are expected to be participating in water-based recreation, 2)
   dogs are likely contributors to fecal contamination in the CRNRA and may
   be sources of pathogenic bacteria indicating further investigation of
   the origins of this contamination may be warranted as would be research
   to understand the human health risks from exposure to dog fecal
   contamination, and 3) high levels of the human marker at one site in the
   CRNRA watershed suggests more extensive monitoring in that catchment may
   locate the origin of human fecal contamination detected during this
   study. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   State-of-the-Art and Future Trends},

Abstract = {The temperature of the lithium-ion battery is a crucial measurement
   during usage for better operation, safety and health of the battery.
   In-situ monitoring of the internal temperature of the cells is an
   important input for temperature control of battery management systems
   and various other related measurements of the battery, such as
   state-of-charge and state-of-health. Currently, most commercial battery
   management systems rely on the surface temperature measurements of the
   cell. However, the internal temperature is comparatively higher than the
   surface temperature due to heat generation within the cell and lower
   heat rejection compared to the surface; therefore, accurate internal
   temperature monitoring methods are essential to improve our knowledge of
   battery safety and health. This paper reviews the most recent studies of
   various online internal temperature monitoring techniques under two main
   themes of hard sensors and soft sensors. The hard sensors include
   sensors that need to be inserted into the cell and other methods that
   use contact-less measuring techniques to infer the internal temperature.
   The soft sensors include estimators/observers that use surface
   measurements and various models to estimate the internal temperature.
   More focus is given to the soft sensors due to the lack of an existing,
   in-depth review of these. These methods are analyzed in detail with
   their accuracy, implementation, measurement frequency, and the common
   challenges and benefits are discussed. Further, possible future trends
   in internal temperature sensing are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Phenology serves as a major indicator of ongoing climate change.
   Long-term phenological observations are critically important for
   tracking and communicating these changes. The phenological observation
   network across Germany is operated by the National Meteorological
   Service with a major contribution from volunteering activities. However,
   the number of observers has strongly decreased for the last decades,
   possibly resulting in increasing uncertainties when extracting reliable
   phenological information from map interpolation. We studied
   uncertainties in interpolated maps from decreasing phenological records,
   by comparing long-term trends based on grid-based interpolated and
   station-wise observed time series, as well as their correlations with
   temperature. Interpolated maps in spring were characterized by the
   largest spatial variabilities across Bavaria, Germany, with respective
   lowest interpolated uncertainties. Long-term phenological trends for
   both interpolations and observations exhibited mean advances of -0.2 to
   -0.3 days year(-1) for spring and summer, while late autumn and winter
   showed a delay of around 0.1 days year(-1). Throughout the year,
   temperature sensitivities were consistently stronger for interpolated
   time series than observations. Such a better representation of regional
   phenology by interpolation was equally supported by satellite-derived
   phenological indices. Nevertheless, simulation of observer numbers
   indicated that a decline to less than 40\% leads to a strong decrease in
   interpolation accuracy. To better understand the risk of declining
   phenological observations and to motivate volunteer observers, a Shiny
   app is proposed to visualize spatial and temporal phenological patterns
   across Bavaria and their links to climate change-induced temperature
   changes.},

Title = {Trends in temperature extremes and their association with circulation
   patterns in China during 1961-2015},

Abstract = {Understanding the dynamic changes of climatic extremes is important to
   predict the occurrences of extreme climate events and to take measures
   to reduce their associated impacts. Based on daily maximum and minimum
   temperature data collected from 1899 meteorological stations in China
   and 8 metrics of large-scale circulation patterns from 1961 to 2015, the
   spatiotemporal trends in temperature extremes and their associations
   with circulation patterns were analyzed. The linear trend analysis and
   Mann-Kendall method were applied to examine the trends, and Pearson
   correlation analysis was used to identify the relationship between
   temperature indices and circulations. Results indicated that the
   increases in tropical nights (TR20), summer days (SU25), warm days
   (TX90p) and warm nights (TN90p), concurrent with the decreases in frost
   days (FDO), ice days (IDO), cool days (TX10p) and cool nights (TN10p)
   were highly pronounced in China as a whole. Spatially, SU25, TN90p and
   TX90p had increased at rates of 1.5-5.0 days, 0-4.0\% and 0-3.0\% per
   decade, while FDO, TN10p and TX10p had decreased at rates of 1.5-6.0
   days, 0.5-4.5\% and 0-2.1\% per decade respectively in almost all of
   China. The increase of TR20 at rates of 0-6.0 days per decade occurred
   in most of China except for Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the northern part
   of northeastern China, and the decreases of IDO at rates of 0-6.0 days
   per decade were appeared mainly in northeastern China, northern China,
   the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river and Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau. Changes in temperature extremes were associated with some
   oceanic and atmospheric circulations, of which Atlantic multidecadal
   oscillation (AMO) and dipole mode index (DMI) had the highest
   correlation with temperature indices in China. The correlations between
   temperature indices and AMO were significant in most of China and those
   between temperature indices and DIM and East Atlantic/Westem Russia
   (EA/WR) were also significant in some parts of China. The variations of
   all cold extremes were also negatively related to Arctic oscillation
   (AO) in northeastern China, northern Xinjiang, the northern parts of
   northern China and eastern China, and those of TN90p and TX90p were
   positively related to AO in northeastern China. These findings will
   provide useful information in forecasting extreme climate events and
   evaluating climate models.},

Title = {Activity Trend for Low-Concentration NO Oxidation at Room Temperature on
   Rutile-Type Metal Oxides},
Journal = {ACS CATALYSIS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {11},
Pages = {10864-10870},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The catalytic oxidation of low-concentration NO at room temperature has
   drawn increasing attention to eliminate NO in the large semiclosed
   spaces. However, the location of efficient catalysts is a challenging
   task. Herein, to rationalize the activity trend of NO oxidation and
   facilitate the catalyst screening/design, we computationally investigate
   the low-concentration NO oxidation processes on an important rutile-type
   of metal oxides (MO2, M = Mn, Ru, Ir, Rh) at room temperature. Some key
   scaling relations for the elementary steps following either the Mars-van
   Krevelen (MvK) mechanism or Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism, are
   revealed as a function of E-f(O-vac) (the formation energy of O-bri
   vacancy) or E-ads(O@M-5c) (the adsorption energy of O at the metallic
   M-5c, site), and a 3D activity map following the MvK mechanism at room
   temperature is quantitatively constructed by combining the DFT results
   with microkinetic analyses. First, we identified the active region in
   terms of E-f(O-vac) and E-ads(O@M-5c) to obtain the optimum activity,
   which requires the bifunctional cooperation of the metallic M-5c and
   lattice O-bri site: M-5c can efficiently adsorb NO, and the O-bri site
   can provide the reactive O species. MnO2 is close to the active region,
   accounting for its good catalytic activity. Second, E-f(O-vac) and
   E-ads(O@M-5c) show a linear-scaling limitation for the pure rutile-type
   oxides, yielding that their catalytic activity can be solely described
   by E-f(O-vac), that is, giving a 2D volcano-typed curve, meaning that
   pure MnO2 cannot give rise to the optimum activity. To break this
   limitation, it requires an increase (decrease) in E-ads(NO@M-Sc)
   (E-f(O-vac)) for enhancing the catalytic activity of MnO2, which could
   be achieved by doping Ti into MnO2(110) from our calculation results.
   Third, we examined the activity with the LH mechanism for a comparison,
   which indicates an oxide-specific mechanism: from MnO2-based oxides to
   RhO2, the MvK mechanism is favored, but switches to the LH mechanism on
   the RuO2 and IrO2 surfaces as E-f(O-vac) increases. Equally importantly,
   the MvK mechanism is found to be favored compared with the LH one on the
   whole, implying that the participation of lattice O-bri is necessary for
   achieving room-temperature oxidation of low-concentration NO. This work
   could provide a significant insight into low-concentration NO oxidation
   at room temperature.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {52},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study investigated the influence of temperature jump
   and liquid-gas ratio on foam stability to derive the foam-decay law.
   Methods: The experimental group conditions were as follows: mutation
   temperatures (10 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 25
   degrees C, and 27 degrees C to >37 degrees C) and liquid-gas ratios
   (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4). The control group conditions were as follows:
   temperatures (10 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 25
   degrees C and 27 degrees C) and liquid-gas ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and
   1:4). A homemade device manufactured using the Tessari DSS method was
   used to prepare the foam. The decay process was videotape recorded. In
   the drainage rate curve, the temperature rose, and the liquid-gas ratio
   varied from 1:1 to 1:4, causing faster decay.
   Results: In the entire process, the foam volume decreased with
   increasing drainage rate. The relationships were almost linear.
   Comparison of the experimental and control groups shows that the
   temperature jump results in a drainage time range of 1 to 15 seconds.
   The half-life ranges from 10 to 30 seconds. The maximum rate is 18.85\%.
   Changes in the preparation temperature yields a drainage time range of 3
   to 30 seconds. The half-life varies from 20 to 60 seconds.
   Conclusion: Decreasing the temperature jump range and liquid-gas ratio
   gradually enhances the foam stability. The foam decay time and drainage
   rate exhibit an exponential function distribution.},

Abstract = {We present in this article a theoretical approach describing the
   viscosity increase in an overmelt liquid as the result of an
   augmentation of covalent bonds in the glass network being created, by
   means of an agglomeration of well-defined structural entities. Thus, one
   can study the characteristic temperature of this agglomeration process,
   identified as the glassy transition temperature, as a function of the
   modifier rate in a binary system. Result analysis and comparison with
   experiment points out that connectedness (and the subjacent entropy of
   the glass network) control mainly the variation of the glass-transition
   temperature with the modifier rate. (C) 2002 Academie des sciences /

Abstract = {During the 1980s, a new agricultural frontier arouse in Brazil, which
   occupied part of the states of Maranho, Tocantins, Piaui, and Bahia.
   Currently, this new frontier is known as the MATOPIBA region. The region
   went through intense transformations in its social and environmental
   characteristics, with the emergence of extensive areas of intensive
   agriculture and large herds. The purpose of this research was to study
   the climatic variabilities of temperature in the MATOPIBA region through
   extreme climate indexes of ClimAp tool. Data from 11 weather stations
   were analyzed for yearly air temperature (maximum and minimum) in the
   period of 1970 to 2012. To verify the trend in the series, we used
   methods of linear regression analysis and Kendall-tau test. The annual
   analysis of maximum and minimum temperatures and of the temperature
   extremes indexes showed a strong positive trend in practically every
   series (with p value less than 0.05). These results indicated that the
   region went through to a significant heating process in the last 3
   decades. The indices of extreme also showed a significant positive trend
   in most of the analyzed stations, indicating a higher frequency of warm
   days during the year.},

Abstract = {It is found that the nonlinear positive Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI) trend of mountain taiga in the south of Krasnoyarsk Krai
   has been negative since 1999-2000. A comparison with the boreal belt of
   northern Eurasia showed that, though still nonnegative, the positive
   trend has distinctly decreased to nearly a plateau. A trend analysis of
   radiation temperature of the surface revealed that the temperature shows
   a decreasing trend for the selected region of mountainous taiga and an
   increasing trend for northern Eurasia. We compared air-temperature data
   from the Yermakovskoe meteorological station to eliminate a preliminary
   data-processing error. Regression analysis demonstrated a fairly high
   degree of correlation. Also, we found a quite high degree of correlation
   between time series and trends of air temperature and NDVI. Trends in
   air temperature in northern Eurasia according to NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2
   data also confirm the trend found on the basis of satellite data.},

   stratospheric temperature and stratospheric residual circulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {Observations of the lower stratospheric temperature over the last three
   decades show seasonal variations in tropical trends together with
   spatial patterns in southern high latitude trends in late winter-spring,
   with regions of cooling and warming of comparable magnitude. Neither
   aspect is reproduced in climate models used in the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). Here we
   show that stratosphere-resolving chemistry-climate models can produce
   these aspects of temperature trends. However, the seasonality of
   temperature trends can vary greatly among simulations of the same model,
   and even if one ensemble member reproduces the observed seasonality in
   trends there may be little agreement with observations for another
   member. The variability in trends among model ensemble members is
   related to differences in trends in wave activity propagating into the
   stratosphere. These results suggest that the seasonality of the observed
   temperature trends could be the result of natural variability as well
   as, or instead of, a response to external forcing, and that comparison
   with these trends may not be a robust test of climate models.},

Abstract = {We present long-term observations of temperature, salinity,
   tritium/He-3, chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC11), and chlorofluorocarbon-12
   (CFC 12) for the central Greenland Gyre. The time series span the
   periods between 1952 and 1994 (temperature), 1981 and 1994 (salinity),
   1972 and 1994 (tritium/He-3), and 1982 and 1994 (CFCs). The correlation
   between hydrographic and transient tracer data indicates that low
   temperatures in the deep water in the early 1950s and between 1960 and
   1980 reflect periods of higher deep water formation rates whereas
   periods of increasing temperatures in the late 1950s and between 1980
   and 1994 are related to low deep water formation rates. However, the
   transient tracer observations obtained in the 1980s and early 1990s
   indicate that even during periods of low deep water formation, some
   water from the upper water column contributed to deep water formation
   between 1980 and 1994. In 1994, the deep water reached temperatures and
   salinities of -1.149 degrees C and 34.899, respectively, and no longer
   fits most of the classical definitions of Greenland Sea Deep Water
   (-1.29 degrees C < Theta < -1.0 degrees C, 34.58 < S < 34.90). The
   temperature increase in the water column between 200 and 2000m depth
   between 1980 and 1994 corresponds to an average heating rate of about 5
   W m(-2) over this period, resulting in a decrease in density. The
   13-year warming could be balanced by intensive cooling in two winters.
   The surface salinity steadily increased from 34.50 in 1991 to 34.85 in
   1994.},

   and investigation of India as study area because India accounts for
   similar to 1/6th of the world population and similar to 14\% of
   globalwheat production. We find that Tmx, Tmp, Tmn, Vpd, Pet are
   increasing in eight and Dtr and Cld in seven Indian states, whereas Wet
   and Vap are decreasing in five and Pre in four Indian states. Most
   climate variables in the present study negatively impact wheat yields.
   The climate trends drive total wheat yield losses up to similar to 309
   kg/ha (similar to 11\%) over the study period. The regression models
   explain up to similar to 80\% of wheat yield variability. The paper
   provides strong evidence that varying climate trends are negatively
   impacting wheat yield in India, thus presenting a global concern. Water
   supply and water demand are important climate variables, essential to be
   investigated in future studies. Using cropping season over standard
   weather classification provides more practical insight in the crop
   yield. This study emphasizes timely attention and intervention in
   agriculture practices leading to policy formation, amendments and
   practical execution.},

Title = {Spatial Analysis of Yield Trends and Impact of Temperature for Wheat
   Crop Across Indian Districts},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Wheat is an important agricultural crop globally. India ranks second in
   the world, accounting for similar to 14\% of global wheat production.
   Wheat provides food and livelihood to a large Indian population. India
   would require improving its wheat yield significantly to feed the
   growing population. Ascertaining the wheat yield trends and their
   sensitivity to rising temperatures is crucial to enable sustainable
   wheat production, ensuring a continuous food supply. India is a diverse
   and vast country. One size fit to all approach seems not to offer
   practical and workable solutions. Therefore, it is essential to perform
   finer resolution analysis to identify the smallest possible
   administrative units (districts) to implement adaptation strategies.
   This study presents the spatial distribution of wheat yield trends and
   the impact of temperature on wheat yield across Indian districts. The
   key differentiating aspect of the present work is the district-level
   analysis compared to state-of-the-art state-level analysis in the
   earlier literature. We developed detailed wheat yield and temperature
   statistics of 50 years (1966-2015) by employing various statistical
   models. The present study's critical findings over the state-of-the-art
   research work are: (1) Wheat yield is not improving in 69 out of 175
   districts across eight major wheat-producing Indian states. 175
   districts included in the analysis constitute similar to 94\% of the
   total wheat harvested area in India, and the 69 identified districts
   constitute similar to 48.3\% of the total wheat harvested area. The
   stagnation in wheat yield is prominent in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh,
   Maharashtra, and Punjab. (2) Mean temperature rise has negatively
   impacted wheat yield in 145 districts (similar to 76.5\% of the total
   wheat harvested area), causing similar to 251 kg/ha (similar to 16\%)
   yield loss in statistically significant districts. The rigorous and
   robust methodology in this paper ensures the validity of findings and
   provides higher confidence in utilizing the findings in policymaking.
   The method and approach used in the study pave the way for similar
   investigations in the other parts of the world, where wheat is an
   important crop.},

Title = {Long-Term Trends for Marine Sulfur Aerosol in the Alaskan Arctic and
   Relationships With Temperature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {125},
Number = {22},

Abstract = {Marine aerosol plays a vital role in cloud-aerosol interactions during
   summer in the Arctic. The recent rise in temperature and decrease in sea
   ice extent have the potential to impact marine biogenic sources.
   Compounds like methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and non-sea-salt sulfate
   (nss-SO42-), oxidation products of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emitted by
   marine primary producers, are likely to increase in concentration.
   Long-term studies are vital to understand these changes in marine sulfur
   aerosol and potential interactions with Arctic climate. Samples were
   collected over three summers at two coastal sites on the North Slope of
   Alaska (Utqiavik and Oliktok Point). MSA concentrations followed
   previously reported seasonal trends, with evidence of high marine
   primary productivity influencing both sites. When added to an additional
   data set collected at Utqiavik, an increase in MSA concentration of +
   2.5\% per year and an increase in nss-SO42- of + 2.1\% per year are
   observed for the summer season over the 20-year record (1998-2017). This
   study identifies ambient air temperature as a strong factor for MSA,
   likely related to a combination of interrelated factors including warmer
   sea surface temperature, reduced sea ice, and temperature-dependent
   chemical reactions. Analysis of individual particles at Oliktok Point,
   within the North Slope of Alaska oil fields, showed evidence of
   condensation of MSA onto anthropogenic particles, highlighting the
   connection between marine and oil field emissions and secondary organic
   aerosol. This study shows the continued importance of understanding MSA
   in the Arctic while highlighting the need for further research into its
   seasonal relationship with organic carbon.},

Abstract = {Understanding the contribution of internal dynamics to recently observed
   land temperature trends is a challenge. In particular, the time-varying
   contributions of internal dynamics to these changes are poorly
   understood. Here, we apply a ``dynamical adjustment{''} method to
   quantitatively estimate the time-varying contribution of the internal
   dynamics to the wintertime land surface air temperature (SAT) trends
   over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during 1961-2018. The observed
   wintertime land SAT trends over the NH are strongly influenced by
   internal dynamical processes, especially over the Eurasian continent.
   The internal dynamically induced SAT trends contribute more than 60\%,
   40\%, and 70\% of total warming during the first 30 years of 1961-1990
   over the NH, North America, and Eurasian continent, respectively. These
   ratios decrease to about 20\% with the extension of time period to
   1961-2018. The time-varying contributions of internal dynamics analogs
   to the multidecadal fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation.},

Abstract = {On the basis of long-term rocket, optical, and radiophysical
   measurements performed in the period from 1955 to 1995, yearly mean
   temperature midlatitude profiles for the height range from 25 to 110 km

   phenomena: a local temperature maximum at heights of about 90 km during
   the periods of maximum solar activity and a regular lowering of height
   levels corresponding to fixed temperatures. The second phenomenon is
   clearly indicative of a long-term subsidence of the middle and upper
   atmosphere. For some atmospheric regions at heights from 25 to 110 km,
   linear temperature trends over the last few decades are estimated,
   namely, negative trends of 0.1-0.9 K/year at 25-100 km and positive ones
   up to 0.8 K/year at about 110 km. The positive trend is caused by a
   change in the vertical thermal structure of the thermosphere as a result
   of the subsidence of the middle and upper atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Mexico is vulnerable to extreme climatic events; however, their impact
   is not uniform in all the country. This study presents an analysis of
   extreme temperatures in 12 Mexican cities, modeled under the assumption
   of a non-stationary climate. Temporal trends were estimated from an
   available climatological base of maximum and minimum temperatures with
   the non-parametric tests of Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope method, and a
   generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution was used to model both
   temperatures. A likelihood ratio test and Akaike and Bayesian
   information criteria were used to evaluate the optimal model choice with
   incorporation of a covariate. Using the best model, return levels and
   confidence intervals for future scenarios were estimated. A trend
   towards urban warming was detected from both the non-parametric tests
   and the GEV distribution, although with heterogeneous behavior. In the
   series of the maximum temperatures, half of the cities analyzed were
   non-stationary, and of those, the city of Guadalajara, located in the
   center-west of the country had a negative trend. The trend for minimum
   temperatures was more uniform, as 90\% of the cities were non-stationary
   with a positive trend, and only 10\%, in an urban area to the east of
   the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico (Milpa Alta) and a coastal
   city of the Gulf of Mexico (Veracruz), showed stationary series. It is
   therefore concluded that return periods of thermal extremes estimated in
   a changing climate temporarily showed a significant variation, so
   statistical modeling must consider this behavior due to its importance
   for risk assessments and adaptation purposes.},

Abstract = {Adaption for temperature should be suitable to local conditions for
   regional differences in temperature change features. This paper proposed
   to utilize nine temperature modes that joint the trend
   (increasing/decreasing/unchanged) with variability
   (intensifying/weakening/unchanged) to investigate features of
   temperature change in mainland China. Monthly temperature data over the
   period 1960-2013 were obtained from 522 national basic and reference
   meteorological stations. Here, temperature trend (TT) was reflected by
   the trend of mean annual temperature (MAT) and the uptrend (downtrend)
   of inter-monthly sliding standard deviation (SSD) series with a sliding
   length of 29 years (348 months) was used for representing the
   intensification (weakening) of temperature variability (TV). The
   Mann-Kendall method and the least squares method were applied to assess
   the significance and quantify the magnitude of trend in MAT and SSD time
   series, respectively. The results show that there is a consistent
   warming trend throughout the country except for only three stations in
   which a cooling trend is identified. Moreover, the overall increasing
   rate in the north of 35A degrees N is the highest, over 0.4 A degrees
   C/decade for most stations. TV is weakened for almost 98\% of the
   stations, indicating the low instability of temperature at a national
   scale. Finally, temperature mode (TM), for more than 90\% of the
   stations, is the combination of an increasing TT with a weakened TV
   (mode 8). So, it is more important for people to adapt to the increasing
   temperature in these regions. Compared to using annual temperature data
   to calculate SSD, monthly data can accurately reflect the inter-monthly
   change of temperature and reserve more initial characteristics of
   temperature.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Projections of future changes in weather extremes on the regional and
   local scale depend on a realistic representation of trends in extremes
   in regional climate models (RCMs). We have tested this assumption for
   moderate high temperature extremes (the annual maximum of the daily
   maximum 2 m temperature, T-ann.max). Linear trends in T-ann.max from
   historical runs of 14 RCMs driven by atmospheric reanalysis data are
   compared with trends in gridded station data. The ensemble of RCMs
   significantly underestimates the observed trends over most of the
   north-western European land surface. Individual models do not fare much
   better, with even the best performing models underestimating observed
   trends over large areas. We argue that the inability of RCMs to
   reproduce observed trends is probably not due to errors in large-scale
   circulation. There is also no significant correlation between the RCM
   T-ann.max trends and trends in radiation or Bowen ratio. We conclude
   that care should be taken when using RCM data for adaptation decisions.},

Abstract = {. Rheophilic fish species characteristic of large river systems are
   finely tuned during early ontogenetic development to the seasonal
   temperature regime of their main nursery habitats in the inshore zones
   of rivers. River regulation and the construction of hydropower dams have
   disrupted the balance between requirements and the field conditions.
   Frequently, temperatures fall below the optimal range in regulated
   rivers due to faster runoff and reduced inshore retention capacity.
   Under such conditions, growth through the ``critical period' during the
   life history is retarded resulting in high mortality rates. This is a
   main reason for the decline of stocks and a critical state of
   recruitment of many riverine species. The trends caused by long-term
   climatic changes have to be similarly addressed from the point of view
   of match or mismatch between requirements and the predicted changes in
   environmental conditions. Long-term trends in the temperature
   development have been analyzed for the Austrian Danube. The potential
   effect of such trends is tested against the temperature dependence of
   embryogenesis and a growth model developed for one of our target
   species, the cyprinid Chondrostoma nasus. Field data on individual daily
   growth rates of larval fish, based on otolith analysis, show that the
   present conditions are critical. The consequences of global change for
   rheophilic fish species in large river systems are discussed. (c) 2004

Abstract = {Separating anthropogenic and natural contributions to global warming is
   crucial for understanding and predicting climate change, but it is
   challenging due to the complexity of the climate system. In this study,
   we try to address this issue by estimating the anthropogenic forcing
   impacts with its long-term persistence features properly considered. In
   this way, a data-driven approach is proposed to decompose the observed
   trends from global and regional scales into anthropogenically- and
   naturally-caused trends. We find that there is a continuous
   anthropogenic global warming trend since the beginning of the last
   century, even during the recent global warming hiatus period. On
   regional scales, the anthropogenically-forced trends among regions are
   found at a similar level, while their unevenly distributed warming
   trends among regions may be attributed to natural causes. Our findings
   provide new insight into climate warming, and our approach based on
   persistence analysis provides a new perspective for attribution studies.},

Title = {Abundance trends of highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean:
   accounting for water temperature profiles},

Abstract = {Relative abundance trends of highly migratory species (HMS) have played
   a central role in debates over the health of global fisheries. However,
   such trends have mostly been inferred from fishery catch rates, which
   can provide misleading signals of relative abundance. While many biases
   are accounted for through traditional catch rate standardization,
   pelagic habitat fished is rarely directly considered. Using a method
   that explicitly accounts for temperature regimes, we analysed data from
   the US pelagic longline fishery to estimate relative abundance trends
   for 34 HMS in the Atlantic Ocean from 1987 through 2013. This represents
   one of the largest studies of HMS abundance trends Model selection
   emphasized the importance of accounting for pelagic habitat fished with
   water column temperature being included in nearly every species'
   model,and in extreme cases, a temperature variable explained 50-60\% of
   the total deviance. Our estimated trends represent observations from one
   fishery only, and a more integrated stock assessment should form the
   basis for conclusions about stock status overall Nonetheless, our trends
   serve as indicators of stock abundance and they suggest that a majority
   of HMS (71\% of analysed species) are either declining in relative
   abundance or declined initially with no evidence of rebuilding.
   Conversely, 29\% of the species exhibited stable, increasing, or
   recovering trends; however, these trends were more prevalent among tunas
   than either billfishes or sharks. By estimating the effects of pelagic
   habitat on fishery catch rates, our results can be used in combination
   with ocean temperature trends and forecasts to support bycatch avoidance
   and other time-area management decisions.},

Abstract = {Temporal changes in the monthly and seasonal temperatures over Varanasi
   District were analysed, based on the 40 years of time series databases
   of daily temperatures from 1971 to 2010. The temperature changes during
   the two tricades of 1971-2000 and 1981-2010 and also for four decades
   starting from 1971 to 2010 were investigated and both the Mann-Kendall
   (MK) trend test and simple linear regression analyses were employed to
   detect trends in the mean maximum temperatures and mean minimum
   temperatures. Various extreme temperatures criteria, as well as their
   corresponding frequencies, were chosen to explore the trends of extreme
   climate change over Varanasi.
   The warming of seasonal mean temperature is mainly attributed to changes
   in the minimum temperature, particularly during the last three decades.
   A pre-monsoon cooling and its association with increase in heat wave
   days suggest that, alongwith large-scale circulation, regional and local
   factors may have played a vital role in influencing the observed climate
   in the studied area.},

Abstract = {In this study, the trends of the annual and seasonal temperature and its
   variations are explored in the Tamil Nadu State of India. In order to
   find the trend direction and the magnitude of change across the state
   during 1969-2016, the mean maximum temperature (MMaxT), mean minimum
   temperature (MMinT), and mean annual temperature (MAT) of 17
   climatological stations are analyzed. Evidently, the increasing trends
   in MMaxT, MMinT, and MAT are observed at the majority of the stations.
   Approximately 82\% of the total stations have shown a significant
   positive trend in MAT and MMaxT at the 95\% confidence level. The MAT
   has increased up to 1.4 degrees C with a variation in the rate of change
   from 0.01 to 0.29 degrees C per decade. MMaxT has shown a significant
   increase with a variation in the rate of change from 0.01 to 0.54
   degrees C per decade for the last 47years. However, MMinT has shown an
   increasing trend in 13 stations and a decreasing trend in 4 stations
   with a variation in the rate of change from -0.05 to 0.31 degrees C per
   decade. In the recent decades, the majority of the stations have
   experienced high warm and the year 2016 is observed to be the warmest
   year. Based on a spatial scale, temperature differences have been
   observed between coastal and inland stations. The majority of the
   coastal stations have shown a high increase in MMaxT as compared to the
   inland and hill stations. On the contrary, the inland stations have
   shown a high increase in MMinT as compared to the coastal stations. A
   more definite increasing trend is observed during the winter and
   postmonsoon seasons followed by the monsoon season.},

Title = {Temperature trends for coastal and adjacent higher lying interior
   regions of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {137},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {373-381},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Temperature trends for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, are
   investigated for the period 1930-2015, with the intention to test
   whether interior regions (within similar to 100km of the coast) are
   warming faster than coastal regions, given oceanic moderating effects
   along the coast. This is achieved through analyzing instrumental
   temperature records from the coastal station of Mount Edgecombe, and
   adjacent interior stations of Cedara and Emerald Dale. The modified
   Mann-Kendall test is used to determine annual and seasonal mean
   temperature (T), maximum temperature (T-max), and minimum temperature
   (T-min) trends for the period 1930-2015, and for the most recent few
   decades. For annual T-max, a significant increasing trend (0.07 degrees
   C/decade) is recorded at the coast, whereas adjacent interior stations
   record no trend. Annual T-min record significant warming at all
   stations, with warming rates over the interior being double that
   recorded at the coast for the period 1930-2015. For seasonal T-min over
   the interior, significant warming rates are recorded: 0.21 degrees
   C/decade (summer), 0.22 degrees C/decade (autumn), 0.20 degrees C/decade
   (winter), and 0.15 degrees C/decade (spring). Seasonal T-min warming
   over the coast were also significant: 0.16 degrees C/decade (summer),
   0.08 degrees C/decade (autumn), 0.06 degrees C/decade (winter), and 0.12
   degrees C/decade (spring). Thus, higher lying interior regions are
   warming at considerably greater magnitudes compared to adjacent coastal
   areas, mainly due to T-min warming trends. For the period 1930-2015,
   record positive annual T-max anomalies are reported for 2015 at Mount
   Edgecombe (mean anomaly=1.6 degrees C), Cedara (mean anomaly=1.7 degrees
   C), and Emerald Dale (mean anomaly=2.0 degrees C).},

Title = {Trends of Sampling Error in Surface Air Temperature on the Tibetan
   Plateau during Recent Decades},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {Understanding errors in surface air temperature (SAT) data and related
   uncertainties is crucial for climate studies because of their impact on
   the accuracy of statistical inferences in scientific conclusions. In
   recent decades, considerable research has focused on the trends and
   evolution of SAT on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, assessment of the
   uncertainties in SAT change on the TP has not been done adequately,
   which is of considerable importance for climate research. Using
   station-observed SAT data from the TP, this study estimates long-term
   variations and trends of sampling error variances in gridded monthly SAT
   data over recent decades. Results revealed large sampling error
   variances in northern and western parts of the TP but small variances in
   eastern, southern, and central areas. The sampling error variances also
   exhibited strong monthly variations with maximum errors in winter and
   minimum values in summer. Furthermore, spatial distributions of the
   trends of seasonal and annual mean sampling error variances were found
   distributed unevenly with decreasing trends found mainly in central and
   southern parts of the TP and increasing trends in northeastern,
   southeastern, and northwestern areas. Additionally, differences were
   also found in the trends of seasonal and annual mean sampling error
   variances on various timescales.},

Title = {Trend analysis and change point detection of annual and seasonal
   temperature series in Peninsular Malaysia},
Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {130},
Number = {5},
Pages = {565-581},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Most of the trend analysis that has been conducted has not considered
   the existence of a change point in the time series analysis. If these
   occurred, then the trend analysis will not be able to detect an obvious
   increasing or decreasing trend over certain parts of the time series.
   Furthermore, the lack of discussion on the possible factors that
   influenced either the decreasing or the increasing trend in the series
   needs to be addressed in any trend analysis. Hence, this study proposes
   to investigate the trends, and change point detection of mean, maximum
   and minimum temperature series, both annually and seasonally in
   Peninsular Malaysia and determine the possible factors that could
   contribute to the significance trends. In this study, Pettitt and
   sequential Mann-Kendall (SQ-MK) tests were used to examine the
   occurrence of any abrupt climate changes in the independent series. The
   analyses of the abrupt changes in temperature series suggested that most
   of the change points in Peninsular Malaysia were detected during the
   years 1996, 1997 and 1998. These detection points captured by Pettitt
   and SQ-MK tests are possibly related to climatic factors, such as El
   Nino and La Nina events. The findings also showed that the majority of
   the significant change points that exist in the series are related to
   the significant trend of the stations. Significant increasing trends of
   annual and seasonal mean, maximum and minimum temperatures in Peninsular
   Malaysia were found with a range of 2-5 degrees C/100years during the
   last 32years. It was observed that the magnitudes of the increasing
   trend in minimum temperatures were larger than the maximum temperatures
   for most of the studied stations, particularly at the urban stations.
   These increases are suspected to be linked with the effect of urban heat
   island other than El Nino event.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},

Abstract = {A detailed overview of long-term secular trends in temperature of the
   mesosphere and lower thermosphere considered to be induced by increase
   in greenhouse gases has been provided by Beig et al. (2003). Since then,
   quite a few new results have been emerged as some of the data series
   have become sufficiently large enough to provide results with improved
   confidence. Our understanding on the nature of temperature trends in the
   mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region is relatively better now. In
   the mesosphere, some of the results confirmed the earlier findings, and
   some new results obtained by satellite and lidar data over the tropical
   region have indicated a relatively weaker cooling trend as compared to
   the past but nevertheless strengthened the conclusion about the cooling
   trends. However, in the mesopause region, some of the new results now
   indicate a break in trend and tendency of negative signal where earlier
   no trend feature was noticed. This slice of no trend feature in between
   two cooling regimes was puzzling the modeling community, who were in
   search of a convincing explanation. This paper briefly outlines the
   progress made over the recent past in the field of MLT region secular
   temperature trends attributed mainly to growth of greenhouse gases near
   the Earth's surface.},

Abstract = {The radiosonde data over two megacities in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, viz.
   Delhi and Kolkata are examined to study the long-term trends in air
   temperature at various pressure levels between 850 and 150 hPa during
   1973-2008. The maximum increase in temperature occurs at 700 hPa over
   both the stations during this period. The warming trends are seen until
   400 hPa, whereas cooling trends are found to occur above this altitude.
   Overall, the annual long-term trends vary between +0.3 and -0.2 degrees
   C/decade for the altitude range studied. Long-term trends in different
   seasons reveal highest warming during winter until 300 hPa over Delhi.
   Over Kolkata, the highest warming occurs during monsoon at heights above
   700 hPa. These trends are found to be the lowest during post-monsoon.
   The important point that has emerged from this study is that there has
   been an accelerated rise in temperature during 1973-2008 when compared
   with a previous study which reported negative trends during an earlier
   period, i.e. 1958-1985.},

   near-surface forcings related to industrialization, such as aerosols. We
   slightly correct previous results by including the year 1979 within the
   satellite decades and by excluding stations in the West Coast of the
   United States. The OMR estimate for surface impact on the mean
   temperature is similar to that obtained using satellite observations of
   night light to discriminate between rural and urban stations, with
   regions of large positive and negative trends, in contrast with the
   urban corrections based on population density, which are uniformly
   positive and much smaller. The OMR seasonal cycle results suggest that
   the impact of the greenhouse gases dominates in the winter, whereas it
   appears that the impact of surface forcings dominates in the summer. The
   impact of the USHCN adjustments for nonclimatic trends in the
   observations does not affect the geographical distribution of the OMR
   trends. The effect of using a model with constant CO2 in the reanalysis,
   the use of other reanalyses, and the possible use of the reanalyses to
   correct for nonclimatic jumps in the observations are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The meridional gradient of sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical
   Atlantic hydrostatically controls the atmospheric pressure gradient,
   thereby steering the latitude position of the Intertropical Convergence
   Zone (ITCZ), which affects rainfall in adjacent land areas. This study
   investigates the mechanisms controlling long-term changes in meridional
   SST gradients, using surface and subsurface ship observations from
   1951-1990. SST forcing from surface heat fluxes and entrainment are
   scaled by monthly climatic-mean mixed-layer depth. Observed SST tendency
   and contributions from various forcing mechanisms are computed for the
   1951-1990 mean and trend. A substantial warming trend in the surface
   waters of the tropical South Atlantic is concentrated in the austral
   summer months of February-March, while SST in the tropical North
   Atlantic increased in boreal summer (August-September) and decreased in
   winter. As a consequence of the strengthened interhemispheric SST
   gradient in February-March, the position of the ITCZ was displaced
   southward, and rainfall in northeast Brazil increased over 1951-1990. A
   southward displacement of the ITCZ during boreal summer,; accompanying
   warming between the equator and the ITCZ contributed to the decrease of
   rainfall over the west African Sahel. Strongest warming trends in the
   respective summer hemisphere imply an amplification of both seasonal
   cooling during winter and warming during summer in each hemisphere.
   During September-February a trend toward intensified northeast trade
   winds results in increased seasonal cooling due to latent heat transfer,
   whereas weakened southeast trades reduce latent heat loss, intensifying
   seasonal warming. For March-August a dominant mechanism forcing enhanced
   seasonal cooling in the South Atlantic is associated with entrainment as
   mixed-layer depth increases during the transition to winter; this
   process acts to dilute warm anomalies developed during summer.},

Abstract = {The temperature trend in the lower stratosphere was negative between
   1964 and 1993. There were, however, large fluctuations on a decadal
   scale, and the slope of the trend can be appreciably different depending
   on whether the time series begins or ends in an extreme of the decadal
   variations. These fluctuations affect the trends in quantities which are
   temperature dependent, such as ozone. For instance, the steep drop in
   ozone measured by TOMS between 1979 and 1990 north of about 30-degrees-N
   occurred in a period with a similarly steep drop in temperature, but
   over a longer period the temperature trend differed considerably from
   that of the TOMS observations. The change in the ozone during the latter
   period is therefore not likely to be representative of a long term ozone
   trend.
   The negative temperature trend in the stratosphere below 30 km peaked at
   50 hPa (18-20 km near the level of highest concentration of ozone) at
   all latitudes in summer, and in the polar regions also in early winter.
   This is in contrast to model predictions of where the level of largest
   negative trend in the stratosphere associated with increasing levels of
   CO2 should be. In January a positive trend began in the arctic above 30
   hPa which expanded downward to the tropopause during the following
   months. The thermal west wind in the area of the cyclonic vortex thus
   weakened from above during the period. This trend pattern resembles the
   development of a warming in the stratosphere in individual years.
   Marked variations of stratospheric geopotential heights on a 10-12 year
   scale were well correlated with the sunspot cycle, and the overall trend
   in the heights of the lower stratosphere was similar to the rise in the
   surface air/tropospheric temperature averaged over the hemisphere.},

Title = {The long-term trend in the diurnal temperature range over Sri Lanka from
   1985 to 2017 and its association with total cloud cover and rainfall},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {227},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study is focused on studying the long-term trend of the diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) in three temperature zones in Sri Lanka using
   daily maximum and minimum temperature data set for the recent 33-year
   (1985-2017). We investigate the potential reasons for the long-term
   trend in the DTR by studying the response of the DTR to Total Cloud
   Cover (TCC) and rainfall on a seasonal basis. On an annual basis,
   results indicate that the DTR significantly decreased per decade by
   -0.14 degrees C, -0.16 degrees C, and -0.18 degrees C over the high
   elevation temperature zone (HT), low-elevation temperature zone one
   (LT-2), and low elevation temperature zone two (LT-2), respectively. The
   annual decreasing trend of DTR in three temperature zones is mainly due
   to the larger increase in minimum temperature over the HT (0.13 degrees
   C/decade), LT-1 (0.23 degrees C/decade), and LT-2 (0.14 degrees
   C/decade) zones than the maximum temperature from 1985 to 2017.
   Furthermore, a decreasing trend in DTR is observed during the southwest
   monsoon (SWM), first inter-monsoon (FIM), second inter-monsoon (SIM),
   and northeast monsoon (NEM) seasons, where the most prominent decreasing
   trend in HT, LT-1, and LT-2 is seen in NEM (-0.19 degrees C/decade), SIM
   (-0.24 degrees C/decade), and SWM (-0.40 degrees C/decade) seasons,
   respectively. The strong inverse correlation between the DTR and TCC in
   all seasons indicates that increasing TCC influences the decrease in DTR
   over the HT, LT-1, and LT-2 zones. Concomitant increasing trends in
   rainfall during NEM, FIM, and SIM seasons may be one of the possible
   causes of the DTR decreases in the aforementioned seasons over three
   temperature zones in Sri Lanka.},

   India},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of the mean (monsoon season, non-monsoon season and
   annual) and extreme annual daily rainfall and temperature at the spatial
   and temporal scales was carried out for all the 33 urban centers of the
   arid and semi-arid state of Rajasthan, India. Statistical trend analysis
   techniques, namely the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator, were
   used to examine trends (1971-2005) at the 10\% level of significance.
   Both positive and negative trends were observed in mean and extreme
   events of rainfall and temperature in the urban centers of Rajasthan
   State. The magnitude of the significant trend of monsoon rainfall varied
   from (-) 6.00 mm/hydrologic year at Nagaur to (-) 8.56 mm/hydrologic
   year at Tonic. However, the magnitude of the significant negative trends
   of non-monsoon rainfall varied from (-) 0.66 mm/hydrologic year at
   Dungarpur to (-) 1.27 mm/hydrologic year at Chittorgarh. The magnitude
   of positive trends of non-monsoon rainfall varied from 0.93
   mm/hydrologic year at Churu to 1.70 mm/hydrologic year at Hanumangarh.
   The magnitude of the significant negative trends of annual rainfall
   varied from (-) 6.47 mm/year at Nagaur to (-) 10.0 mm/year at Tonic. The
   minimum, average and maximum temperature showed significant increasing
   warming trends on an annual and seasonal scale in most of the urban
   centers in Rajasthan State. The magnitude of statistically significant
   annual extreme daily rainfall varied from 2.00 mm at Jhalawar to (-)
   1.64 mm at Tonk, while the magnitude of statistically significant
   extreme annual daily minimum and maximum temperature varied from 0.03
   degrees C at Ganganagar to 0.05 degrees C at Jhalawar, respectively. The
   spatial variations of the trends in mean (monsoon season, non-monsoon
   season and annual) and extreme annual daily rainfall and temperature
   were also determined using the inverse-distance-weighted (IDW)
   interpolation technique. IDW results are helpful to identify trends and
   variability in mean and extreme rainfall and temperature in space and
   time for the study locations where the data is not available and the
   quality of data is not good. These spatial maps of temperature and
   rainfall can help local stakeholders and water managers to understand
   the risks and vulnerabilities related to climate change in terms of mean
   and extreme events in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   concentration and wet deposition from the NADP and CAPMoN measurements},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {With the implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in the
   U.S. and similar emission reduction measures in Canada, sulfur dioxide
   (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions in the eastern U.S.
   and Eastern Canada declined significantly during the period 1989-2016.
   Correspondingly, air quality over the region improved tremendously and
   sulfate, nitrate and acidity in precipitation decreased significantly.
   In this study, we analyzed measurement data in the eastern U.S. and
   Eastern Canada from the two national long-term wet deposition networks,
   the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network
   (NADP/NTN) in the U.S. and the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring
   Network (CAPMoN) in Canada, to reveal the spatial-temporal trends of
   precipitation concentrations and wet deposition of sulfate, nitrate,
   ammonium and acid in the eastern part of North America (broken into 4
   different regions) for the period of 1989-2016. Comparing 2014-2016 to
   1989-1991, the results show that the acid, sulfate and nitrate wet
   deposition decreased by 78\%, 69\% and 46\% for 1989-2016, and decreased
   annually at rates of 2.8 similar to-3.6\% yr(-1), -2.5 similar to-2.9\%
   yr(-1), and -1.6 similar to-2.0\% yr(-1) over different regions,
   respectively. It also revealed that there were no statistically
   significant trends for the annual mean wet concentrations of ammonium
   (NH4+) in precipitation in the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic of the U.S.
   (P>0.4 respectively). However, there were statistically significant
   increasing trends of annual wet deposition of NH4+ over these latter two
   regions (P = 0.01-0.13) with an annual rate of increase of 0.6\% and
   0.4\%, respectively. The increasing trends of wet deposition of NH4+ in
   these regions were mostly due to increasing annual precipitation
   amounts, as indicated by positive correlation coefficients between them
   (R = 0.67-0.77), and a statistically significant increasing trend of the
   precipitation amount during the period. The annual mean wet
   concentration of chloride ion (Cl-) in precipitation in the above two

Abstract = {This study presents the development of a new dataset of homogenized
   temperature for use in trend analysis and monitoring climate change in
   Canada. This dataset contains daily data for 780 locations across the
   country: 508 locations with an active station (current observations) and
   long record (starting prior to 1990); 53 locations with an active
   station and short record (starting after 1990); and 219 locations with
   no current observations (station closed) but with more than 30 years of
   data. Daily observations from nearby sites were often merged into a
   single record to create a long time series. This new dataset includes
   observations taken at Reference Climate Stations and from the Canada
   Aviation Weather Services, which are used to extend past climate
   observations into recent times. First, the data were quality controlled.
   The daily minimum temperature was adjusted for the change in observing
   time at principal stations in 1961. Parallel daily data were used to
   detect non-climatic shifts when the observations from nearby sites were
   merged. Series of annual and seasonal mean temperatures were tested for
   homogeneity. Daily temperatures were adjusted using a quantile-matching
   procedure if needed. Two main causes of data inhomogeneity affecting the
   trends over the 1948-2018 and 1900-2018 periods were identified. First,
   the change in observing time in 1961 introduced a cold bias in the
   annual means of the daily minimum temperatures after 1961. Second,
   merging observations from airport stations with older records has often
   created an artificial decreasing shift in the unadjusted data because of
   the better exposure of the instruments at airport stations. This new
   homogenized dataset shows a slightly stronger warming than the
   unadjusted data: the trend in the annual mean temperature for Canada has
   changed from 1.69 degrees to 1.74 degrees C for 1948-2018, and the trend
   for southern Canada has changed from 1.32 degrees to 1.62 degrees C for
   1900-2018 because of all the adjustments applied to daily temperature in
   this study.},

Title = {Trends in extreme temperature indices in Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin of
   China during 1961-2014},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal characteristics of temperature extremes have been
   investigated in Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) region based on the daily series of
   temperature observations from 162 meteorological stations. A total of 11
   indices were used to assess the changes of temperature pattern. Linear
   trend analyses revealed that the daily maximum temperature (TXx)
   increased at =0.05 level with a magnitude of 0.15 degrees C per decade
   on the regional scale during the period of 1961-2014. More pronounced
   warming trend of the daily minimum temperature (TNn) was detected at a
   rate of 0.49 degrees C per decade (=0.01 level). Consequently, a
   decreasing trend of the temperature range of TXx and TNn (extreme
   temperature range) was observed. The frequency of hot days (TXf90) and
   annual average of warm events (warm spell duration indicator, WSDI)
   showed significant increasing trends, while that of cold nights (TNf10)
   and cold events (cold spell duration indicator, CSDI) showed opposite
   behaviors. Both warm winter (W-W) and hot summer (H-S) series displayed
   significant increasing trends at =0.01 confidence level. The cold winter
   (C-W) series showed a decreasing trend at =0.01 confidence level, while
   the cool summer (C-S) series showed a nonsignificant decreasing trend
   that is not passing the 90\% confidence level (=0.1). Abrupt increments
   of warmrelated extremes (TXx, TXf90, WSDI) have been detected since
   1990s, and a steadily decreasing trend of cold related extremes (TNf10,
   CSDI) was found since 1970s. Ten hot summers out of 11 and nine warm
   winters out of 10 occurred after 1990s. Altitude has a large impact on
   spatial pattern of extreme temperature indices, and the urban heat
   island effect also has an impact on amplitude of variation in extreme
   temperature. Trend magnitudes are significantly larger at sites with
   high altitudes for warmrelated indices (TXx, TXf90, WSDI), while those
   involving cold-related indices (TNn, TNf10) are remarkably larger for
   stations with low altitudes.},

Abstract = {Methyl and ethyl esters of carboxylic acids can be obtained from the
   trans-esterification of fatty acid triglycerides using methanol and
   ethanol, respectively. In this work, the relative ignition of methyl and
   ethyl esters is reported, based on new high-temperature shock tube
   ignition data of ethyl acetate (EA) and ethyl propanoate (EP). These are
   compared with literature data for other methyl and ethyl esters, and
   isomer and alkyl group effects are also investigated. It is found that
   ethyl esters are generally characterized by shorter ignition delay times
   than those of methyl esters of the corresponding alkanoic acid.
   Increased reactivity of ethyl esters is also observed for isomeric ethyl
   and methyl esters. A combined high-temperature chemical kinetic model is
   proposed for methyl and ethyl acetates as well as for ethyl formate in
   order to shed light on the link between chemical structure and the
   observed reactivity trends. The proposed model reflects the experimental
   trends and generally predicts ignition delay times in close agreement
   with measured data. The reduced methyl acetate reactivity is attributed
   both to the absence of more reactive secondary C H sites and the ethyl
   group which facilitates complex unimolecular decomposition reactions in
   ethyl esters such as acid and ethylene elimination. The model and the
   new experimental data contribute toward improved understanding and
   modeling of the combustion properties of biodiesel surrogates.},

Abstract = {The changing characteristics of the frozen ground are essential
   indicators of climate change. The soil temperature on the Tibetan
   Plateau (TP) during 1987-2018 is simulated using the coupled model of
   RegCM4.7-CLM4.5. The results show that there is a significant warming
   trend in the soil temperature on the TP, and the warming trend is higher
   in October-May (0.040 degrees C.decade(-1)) than in June-September
   (0.026 degrees C.decade(-1)), with the maximum value in February (0.058
   degrees C.decade(-1)). Spatially, the warming is most significant in the
   Three River Source Region (0.15 similar to 0.20 degrees C.decade(-1))
   and near the Himalayas and Kunlun Mountains (0.20 similar to 25 degrees
   C.decade(-1)), with the warming trend greater in winter and spring than
   in summer and autumn. Air temperature, total precipitation, maximum snow
   depth, and maximum frozen ground depth are all significantly correlated
   to soil temperature. Air temperature (R = 0.851) and total precipitation
   (R = 0.411) are positively correlated with soil temperature, while
   maximum snow depth (R = -0.381) and maximum frozen ground depth (R =
   -0.770) are negatively correlated with it. Air temperature has a strong
   influence on the soil temperature in all the four seasons, while the
   effect of the total precipitation is strongest in autumn (R = 0.836).
   The retarding effects of maximum snow depth and maximum frozen ground
   depth are strongest in summer (R = -0.772 and -0.35, respectively). The
   frozen ground on the TP shows a degradation trend, and the consequent
   hydrological, ecological, and climatic effects deserve sufficient
   attention.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Number = {23},
Pages = {6217-6229},

Abstract = {A representative temperature record for New Zealand based on station
   data rom 1853 onward is used in conjunction with four coupled climate
   models to investigate the causes of recent warming over this small
   midlatitude country. The observed variability over interannual and
   decadal time scales is simulated well by the models. The variability of
   simulated 50-yr trends is consistent with the very short observational
   record. For a simple detection analysis it is not possible to separate
   the observed 30- and 50-yr temperature trends from the distribution
   created by internal variability in the model control simulations. A
   pressure index that is representative of meridional flow (M1) is used to
   show that the models fail to simulate an observed trend to more
   southerly flows in the region. The strong relationship between
   interannual temperature variability and the M1 index in both the
   observations and the models is used to remove the influence of this
   circulation variability from the temperature records. Recent 50-yr
   trends in the residual temperature record cannot be explained by natural
   climate variations, but they are consistent with the combined climate
   response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, ozone depletion, and
   sulfate aerosols, demonstrating a significant human influence on New
   Zealand warming. This result highlights the effect of circulation
   variability on regional detection and attribution analyses. Such
   variability can either mask or accelerate human-induced warming in
   observed trends, underscoring the importance of determining the
   underlying forced trend, and the need to adequately capture regional
   circulation effects in climate models.},

Title = {Trends and Variability in Temperature and Related Extreme Indices in
   Rwanda during the Past Four Decades},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Analysis of the trends and variability of climate variables and extreme
   climate events is important for climate change detection in space and
   time. In this study, the trends and variabilities of minimum, maximum,
   and mean temperatures, as well as five extreme temperature indices, are
   analyzed over Rwanda for the period of 1983 to 2022. The Modified
   Mann-Kendall test and the Theil-Sen estimator are used for the analysis
   of, respectively, the trend and the slope. The standard deviation is
   used for the analysis of the temporal variability. It is found, on
   average, over the country, a statistically significant (\& alpha; =
   0.05) positive trend of 0.17 \& DEG;C/decade and 0.20 \& DEG;C/decade in
   minimum temperature, respectively, for the long dry season and short
   rain season. Statistically significant (\& alpha; = 0.05) positive
   trends are observed for spatially averaged cold days (0.84 days/decade),
   warm nights (0.62 days/decade), and warm days (1.28 days/decade). In
   general, maximum temperature represents higher variability compared to
   the minimum temperature. In all seasons except the long dry season,
   statistically significant (\& alpha; = 0.05) high standard deviations
   (1.4-1.6 \& DEG;C) are observed over the eastern and north-western
   highlands for the maximum temperature. Cold nights show more
   variability, with a standard deviation ranging between 5 and 7 days,
   than the cold days, warm nights, and warm days, having, respectively,
   standard deviations ranging between 2 and 3, 4 and 5 days, and 3 and 4,
   and, especially in the area covering the central, south-western,
   south-central, and northwestern parts of Rwanda. Temperature increase
   and its variability have an impact on agriculture, health, water
   resources, infrastructure, and energy. The results obtained from this
   study are important since they can serve as the baseline for future
   projections. These can help policy decision making take objective
   measures for mitigation and adaptation to climate change impacts.},

Title = {On the mechanisms of late 20th century sea-surface temperature trends
   over the Antarctic Circumpolar Current},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},

Abstract = {The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), with its associated
   three-dimensional circulation, plays an important role in global
   climate. This study concentrates on surface signatures of recent climate
   change in the ACC region and on mechanisms that control this change.
   Examination of climate model simulations shows that they match the
   observed late 20th century sea-surface temperature (SST) trends averaged
   over this region quite well, despite underestimating the observed
   surface-wind increases. Such wind increases, however, are expected to
   lead to significant cooling of the region, contradicting the observed
   SST trends. Motivated by recent theories of the ACC response to variable
   wind and radiative forcing, the authors used two idealized models to
   assess contributions of various dynamical processes to the SST evolution
   in the region. In particular, a high-resolution channel model of the ACC
   responds to increasing winds by net surface ACC warming due to enhanced
   mesoscale turbulence and associated heat transports in the mixed layer.
   These fluxes, modeled, in a highly idealized fashion, via increased
   lateral surface mixing in a coarse-resolution hybrid climate model,
   substantially offset zonally non-uniform surface cooling due to air-sea
   flux and Ekman-transport anomalies. These results suggest that the
   combination of these opposing effects must be accounted for when
   estimating climate response to any external forcing in the ACC region.},

Title = {Time series analysis of temperature and rainfall-based weather
   aggregation reveals significant correlations between climate turning
   points and potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L) yield trends in Japan},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {263},
Pages = {147-155},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Potato (Solarium tuberosum L) yield per unit area in Hokkaido, Japan
   used to be the highest in the world; however, it has levelled off
   recently. The objectives of this study were to determine how recent
   climate variations drive potato yields and to understand the causes for
   this tendency of yield to level off. We used the 1-km mesh resolution
   for meteorological data; aggregation was performed for each municipality
   based on annual potato cultivation area; yield data were obtained from
   crop statics of Tokachi and Okhotsk regions in Hokkaido for the years
   1986-2014. Potato yield was not only determined by temperatures during
   plant growth, as expected, but also by temperatures before planting.
   Probable yield inflexion point corresponded with increase in late summer
   temperature from the year 2000 onward. The negative correlation between
   spring and summer temperatures during the years 2000-2014 resulted from
   patterns of warm spring/cool summer or cool spring/hot summer, linked to
   the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation. A cool spring delayed planting
   and germination, whereas a hot summer shortened the growth period,
   causing the lowest yield in the year 2010. High temperatures in summer
   have encouraged farmers in Japan to implement adaptation strategies,
   such as earlier planting. As early plantation does not necessarily
   reduce time to sprout nor does it promote a longer growth period, the
   recent climate trend exacerbated potato yield responsiveness to summer
   temperature. As a result, increasing temperatures in summers from the
   late 2000s and unaltered spring temperatures as well as a shift in
   cultivars have caused potato yields in eastern Hokkaido to drop below
   those of other countries where potato yields are high. Detection of
   decadal climate shift as a planned-scale strategy and enhancement of
   drainage as a farm-scale strategy could effectively improve regional
   potato yield despite climate change.},

Title = {Decadal Trends in the Temperature Dependence of Summertime Urban
   PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the Northeast United States},
Journal = {ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 8},
Abstract = {Temperature has been identified as a key control over particulate matter
   of diameters smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5); however, the mechanisms
   controlling this phenomenon in urban areas have not been definitively
   elucidated. With increasing urbanization and associated heat-island
   effects as well as a warming climate, understanding the role that
   temperature plays in modulating urban aerosol mass is critical. We
   explore the link between temperature and aerosol mass using observations
   from seven cities in the Northeast U.S., finding that summertime PM2.5
   exhibits a strong linear dependence on temperature going back at least
   two decades. Early in this record, the leading cause of the PM2.5 mass
   increase with temperature was an increase in the ammonium sulfate
   aerosol mass. We suggest that this was due to increased electricity
   consumption to support air conditioning on warmer days and the
   associated SO2 emissions from coal burning power plants. Later in the
   record and in the present day, the leading cause of the linear
   correlation of PM2.5 mass with temperature is the increase in organic
   aerosol mass with temperature. Effective policy for curbing high PM2.5
   events in the future will depend on understanding the factors
   influencing this temperature-dependent enhancement in organic aerosols
   specifically, whether they are related to biogenic emissions,
   anthropogenic emissions, or chemical processes.},

Title = {Spatial and Seasonal Variability of Long-Term Sea Surface Temperature
   Trends in Aegean and Levantine Basins},

Abstract = {This study aims to estimate the spatial variability of the long-term
   trends of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea
   including the Aegean Sea for 39 years between 1982 and 2020. Two
   datasets consisting of in-situ daily mean SSTs provided by the Turkish
   State Meteorological Service for the 12 stations located along the
   Aegean and Levantine coasts of Turkey and gridded daily mean Optimum
   Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature version 2.1 (OISSTv2.1) data
   obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
   of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) are used for this aim. The trend of change in SST is computed
   using a non-parametric Theil-Sen estimator methodology. The significance
   of trends is computed using the Mann-Kendall test. As well as the
   long-term trends of monthly mean SST, the trends of monthly minimum and
   maximum SSTs are analyzed to reveal the long-term variations of extreme
   SSTs. It is concluded that there is a statistically significant upward
   trend within the study area. The annual basin-averaged upward trends of
   monthly mean, minimum, and maximum SSTs are estimated as 0.039 degrees
   C/year, 0.043 degrees C/year, and 0.037 degrees C/year, respectively.
   Coastal in-situ data present different characteristics for the Aegean
   Sea and the Levantine Basin. Aegean Sea stations show that the annual
   maximum SST has a higher rate of upward trend than the annual mean and
   minimum SSTs, while measurements from the Levantine Basin show minimum
   SST values increasing at a greater rate than both the annual means and
   maximums. Analysis of in-situ data at 12 stations provides statistically
   significant trends between 0.024 degrees C/year and 0.055 degrees
   C/year, 0.025 degrees C/year and 0.093 degrees C/year, and 0.031 degrees
   C/year and 0.071 degrees C/year for annual mean, annual minimum, and
   annual maximum SSTs, respectively. Seasonal analysis of the monthly mean
   SST trends shows that the highest upward trend occurs in August at the
   Dikili station (Aegean Sea) with a rate of 0.110 degrees C/year. SST in
   the study area is significantly affected by the Atlantic Multidecadal
   Oscillation (AMO), Eastern Atlantic (EA), and East Atlantic/West Russia
   (EA/WR) indices.},

Title = {Contrasting long-term temperature trends reveal minor changes in
   projected potential evapotranspiration in the US Midwest},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Warming generally leads to increased evaporative demand, altering the
   amount of water needed for growing crops. For the Midwest, some studies
   have suggested that reaching yield targets by 2050 will not be possible
   without additional precipitation or large expansion of irrigation. Here,
   we show that this claim is not supported by the historical summer
   climate trends, which indicate that the warming of daily average
   temperatures is largely driven by increases in minimum temperatures,
   while maximum temperatures have decreased. This has translated into a
   net decrease in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and potential
   evapotranspiration (PET). With the increasing rainfall, this suggests
   that crop water deficits have likely become less frequent in the region
   despite the warming climate. By projecting these trends into 2050 and
   ancillary use of a crop model, we estimate minor changes in PET that
   would have minimal effects on corn yields (<6\%) under persistence of
   these trends. Warming in the US Midwest is believed to increase the
   water needed to grow crops. This study finds that, on the contrary, due
   to rising rainfall and minimum temperature, and decreasing maximum
   temperature, potential crop water demand remains unchanged despite the
   warming climate.},

Abstract = {Soil temperature is a key factor in engineering design, construction and
   operation involved in permafrost engineering, and is closely associated
   with engineering stability. Here, the study shows that the wavelet
   transformation analysis method provides a better understanding of soil
   temperature in the time-frequency domain. Semimonthly soil temperature
   time series for two monitoring sites along the Qinghai-Xizang Highway
   were analyzed using wavelet analysis from 1996 to 2012. Periodic
   characteristics and trends in soil temperature were determined. The
   results show that soil temperatures under natural ground and embankment
   settings have similar periodic change at both sites. Six periods of 18,
   36, 78, 130, 220 and 342 half-months were observed. Cold/warm cycles in
   soil temperature were qualitatively appraised using Morlet wavelets for
   soil temperatures at these two sites over a cold period in 2012, as well
   as for soil temperature below embankment at site no. 5 over a warm
   period. The changes in soil temperature were quantitatively appraised by
   decomposing and reconstructing soil temperature using dbN wavelets; soil
   temperature at both sites showed an increasing trend over the past 17
   years, with a rise in soil temperature under the natural ground and the
   embankment corresponding to 0.022 and 0.072 A degrees C a(-1) in warm
   permafrost and 0.048 and 0.007 A degrees C a(-1) in cold permafrost.},

Title = {Tree-ring derived Little Ice Age temperature trends from the central

Abstract = {Most glaciers in the British Columbia Coast Mountains reached their
   maximum Holocene extent during the Little Ice Age. Early- and
   late-Little Ice Age intervals of expansion and retreat fluctuations
   describe a mass-balance response to changing climates. Although existing
   dendroclimatic records provide insights into these climatic fluctuations
   over the last 400 yr, their short durations prohibit evaluation of
   early-Little Ice Age climate variability. To extend the duration of
   these records, submerged coarse woody debris salvaged from a
   high-elevation lake was cross-dated to living chronologies. The
   resulting chronology provides the opportunity to reconstruct a regional
   June-July air-temperature anomaly record extending from AD 1225 to 2010.
   The reconstruction shows that the intervals AD
   1350-1420.1475-1550,1625-1700 and 1830-1940 characterized distinct
   periods of below-average June-July temperature followed by periods of
   above-average temperature. Our reconstruction provides the first
   annually resolved insights into high-elevation climates spanning the
   Little Ice Age in this region and indicates that Little Ice Age moraine
   stabilization corresponds to persistent intervals of warmer-than-average
   temperatures. We conclude that coarse woody debris submerged in
   high-elevation lakes has considerable potential for developing lengthy
   proxy climate records, and we recommend that researchers focus attention
   on this largely ignored paleoclimatic archive. (c) 2012 University of

Abstract = {Despite uncertainties as to the real causes, there is a large amount of
   evidence of climatic change on Earth. With the objective of
   investigating changes in extreme air temperatures, as well as the local
   effects of these changes, eight data sets, collected throughout the
   State of Ceara in Brazil, were analyzed. Four series of data were
   obtained from the semi-arid region, three from the coastal zone, and one
   from a mountainous region. To quantify the changes that occurred during
   the study period, variations in maximum and minimum temperatures were
   calculated in relation to the mean of each data series. The annual rates
   of temperature increase were estimated from the angular coefficients of
   the best-fit lines. The results showed that although there are
   differences in trends between stations, there was a systematic increase
   in the maximum and minimum temperature in the nineties, which was
   especially evident in the following decade. The highest rates of
   increase were recorded for the minimum temperatures (from 9.0 to 8.3
   degrees C per century) for the stations at Guaramiranga and Crateus
   respectively. These data provide evidence for a greater retention of
   energy in the form of sensible heat during the night, possibly due to a
   more difficult energy exchange between the surface and the atmosphere.},

Title = {Trend and variability of surface air temperature in northeastern Spain
   (1920-2006): Linkage to atmospheric circulation},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {159-180},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {An assessment of long-term change and variability of temperature over
   northeastern Spain (1920-2006) is provided using a dataset of 19
   observatories. In addition, a more detailed analysis of the spatial and
   temporal variability of maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures, and the
   diurnal temperature range (DTR) has also been carried out employing 128
   observatories spanning the period from 1960 to 2006. In general,
   maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures have increased significantly,
   mainly from 1960. Contrarily, the DTR showed less coherent variability
   with both positive and negative trends. On a seasonal scale, the
   analysis reveals that the weakest trends (mostly insignificant at the
   5\% level) were observed during autumn, while the strongest warming
   rates were found during summer and spring. Spatially, the observed
   warming was more robust in the coastal proportions compared with
   mainland observatories. The trends on the annual timescale are spatially
   consistent with those observed in warm seasons (summer and spring)
   rather than in cold seasons (winter and autumn). This study also
   explores the forcing mechanisms that can explain temperature variability
   on seasonal timescales. This variability can markedly be connected to
   variations in the large-scale atmospheric patterns. Notably, the Eastern
   Atlantic (EA), the Scandinavian (SCA), and the Western Mediterranean
   Oscillation (WeMO) patterns exert a significant influence on temperature
   variations in the study domain. Our results confirm that circulation
   patterns have spatially variable influences on temperature on both
   seasonal and annual timescales. Changes in patterns of atmospheric
   flows, as driven by increase in zonal circulation and anticyclonic
   conditions in recent decades, seem to play a noticeable role to explain
   spatio-temporal variability of temperatures in the study domain. (C)

   Regions of the Northern Hemisphere},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper, we used data from 42 soil temperature observation sites
   in permafrost regions throughout the Northern Hemisphere to analyze the
   characteristics and variability in soil temperature. The observation
   data were used to evaluate soil temperature simulations at different
   depths from 10 CMIP6 models in the permafrost region of the Northern
   Hemisphere. The results showed that the annual average soil temperature
   in the permafrost regions in the Northern Hemisphere gradually decreased
   with increasing latitude, and the soil temperature gradually decreased
   with depth. The average soil temperatures at different depths were
   mainly concentrated around 0 degrees C. The 10 CMIP6 models performed
   well in simulating soil temperature, but most models tended to
   underestimate temperatures compared to the measured values. Overall, the
   CESM2 model yielded the best simulation results, whereas the CNRM-CM6-1
   model performed the worst. The change trends in annual average soil
   temperature across the 42 sites ranged from -0.17 degrees C/10a to 0.41
   degrees C/10a from 1900 to 2014, the closer to the Arctic, the faster
   the soil warming rate. The rate of soil temperature change also varied
   at different depths between 1900-2014 and 1980-2014. The rate of soil
   temperature change from 1980 to 2014 was approximately three times
   greater than that from 1900 to 2014.},

Abstract = {Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is indicative of changes in
   climate and geomorphology. It has been found that LSWT has shown faster
   warming than air temperature in recent decades, which has greatly
   affected the aquatic ecosystem of lakes and even led to ecological
   collapse. It was mainly caused by climate warming and geomorphological
   changes caused by human activities. However, lakes with different
   properties respond differently to these changes, resulting in temporal
   and spatial heterogeneity in the changes of LSWT. After an extensive
   literature review, it was found that the research on LSWT is mainly
   focused on the following aspects: 1) qualitative or quantitative
   analysis of natural and anthropogenic factors affecting LSWT changes; 2)
   impacts of LSWT changes on lake ecology; 3) acquisition of LSWT data,
   such as retrieval based on remote sensing imagery, model-based
   simulation prediction; and 4) study of temporal and spatial variation
   characteristics of LSWT long time series. Dynamically monitoring LSWT
   changes, predicting, and quantifying the response of lakes with
   different properties to abrupt or gradual climate changes and changes in
   human activity intensity, can inform modeling of ecosystem response
   processes and long-term management planning of large freshwater
   ecosystems. Therefore, this article provides a systematic review of LSWT
   from the above four aspects to provide empirical insight and
   methodological reference for conducting LSWT research.},

Title = {Temperature trends for reaction rates, hydrogen generation, and
   partitioning of iron during experimental serpentinization of olivine},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {175-200},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to examine how
   partitioning of Fe among solid reaction products and rates of H-2
   generation vary as a function of temperature during serpentinization of
   olivine. Individual experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging
   from 200 to 320 degrees C, with reaction times spanning a few days to
   over a year. The extent of reaction ranged from <1\% to similar to 23\%.
   Inferred rates for serpentinization of olivine during the experiments
   were 50-80 times slower than older studies had reported but are
   consistent with more recent results, indicating that serpentinization
   may proceed more slowly than previously thought. Reaction products were
   dominated by chrysotile, brucite, and magnetite, with minor amounts of
   magnesite, dolomite, and iowaite. The chrysotile contained only small
   amounts of Fe (X-Fe = 0.03-0.05, with similar to 25\% present as ferric
   Fe in octahedral sites), and displayed little variation in composition
   with reaction temperature. Conversely, the Fe contents of brucite (X-Fe
   = 0.01-0.09) increased steadily with decreasing reaction temperature.
   Analysis of the reaction products indicated that the stoichiometry of
   the serpentinization reactions varied with temperature, but remained
   constant with increasing reaction progress at a given temperature. The
   observed distribution of Fe among the reaction products does not appear
   to be entirely consistent with existing equilibrium models of Fe
   partitioning during serpentinization, suggesting improved models that
   include kinetic factors or multiple reaction steps need to be developed.
   Rates of H-2 generation increased steeply from 200 to 300 degrees C, but
   dropped off at higher temperatures. This trend in H-2 generation rates
   is attributable to a combination of the overall rate of serpentinization
   reactions and increased partitioning of Fe into brucite rather than
   magnetite at lower temperatures. The results suggest that millimolal
   concentration of H-2 could be attained in moderately hot hydrothermal
   systems like Lost City during fluid circulation on timescales of a few
   years. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Temperature anomalies in the lower stratosphere (namely, at 50-hPa)
   poleward of 30 degrees N (hereafter, T-50) are analysed from reanalysis
   daily products (i.e. ERA-40 and NCEP/NCAR) in order to detect those
   regions with statistically significant trends of T-50 during the common
   1957-2002 period. We also analyse radiosonde data in order to validate
   the reanalyses results. The analyses are conducted for the extended
   polar winter (i.e. from November to May) in order to relate T-50 changes
   to the northern polar vortex variability. In relation to the previous
   literature, the novelty of this study is double: first, temporal
   evolution is considered according to regions with similar T-50 temporal
   variability in the Northern Hemisphere; second, trend analyses of
   stratospheric temperatures are obtained with the use of running windows
   with variable width of each principal component series computed from
   monthly mean values. Two main stratospheric regions were identified from
   both reanalyses, with a statistically significant cooling within the
   study period: one over the high latitudes and a second one tracing a
   subtropical ring. The first one was detected in November, December and
   May during several decades, particularly at the beginning and in the
   middle of the study period (i.e. 1957-1985). The second region (i.e. the
   subtropical ring) showed overall cooling for all months along the study
   period. In addition, the lower stratospheric temperature over northern
   Europe exhibited an outstanding cooling in May for the whole study
   period. The results obtained from both reanalyses are practically
   identical, a fact that provides robustness thereto. Radiosonde data
   confirm the above-mentioned results, but the magnitude of the trends
   given by reanalysis products is substantially overestimated in the
   winter months over high latitudes.},

Title = {Seasonal variation in the long-term warming trend in water temperature
   off the Western Australian coast},
Journal = {MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-139},
Abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that one area of greatest increase in
   surface sea temperatures (SST) (0.02 degrees C per year) in the Indian
   Ocean over the last 50 years occurs off the lower west coast of
   Australia, an area dominated by the Leeuwin Current. The present paper
   examines water temperature trends at several coastal sites since the
   early 1970s: two rock lobster puerulus monitoring sites in shallow water
   (<5 m); four sites from a monitoring program onboard rock lobster
   vessels that provide bottom water temperature (<36 m); and an
   environmental monitoring site at Rottnest (0-50 m depth). Two global SST
   datasets are also examined. These data show that there was a strong
   seasonal variation in the historic increases in temperature off the
   lower west coast of Australia, with most of the increases (0.02-0.035
   degrees C per year) only focussed on 4-6 months over the austral
   autumn-winter with little or no increase (<0.01 degrees C per year)
   apparent in the austral spring-summer period. These increases are also
   apparent after taking into account the interannual variation in the
   strength of the Leeuwin Current. The warming trend results in a change
   to the seasonal temperature cycle over the decades, with a delay in the
   peak in the temperature cycle during autumn between the 1950s and 2000s
   of similar to 10-20 days. A delay in the timing of the minimum
   temperature is also apparent at Rottnest from August-September to
   October. This seasonal variation in water temperature increases and its
   effect on the annual temperature cycle should be examined in climate
   models because it provides the potential to better understand the
   specific processes through which climate change and global warming are
   affecting this region of the Indian Ocean. It also provides an
   opportunity to further test the climate models to see whether this
   aspect is predicted in the future projections of how increases will be
   manifest. Any seasonal variation in water temperature increase has
   important implications for fisheries and the marine ecosystem because it
   may affect many aspects of the annual life cycle such as timing of
   growth, moulting, mating, spawning and recruitment, which have to be
   taken into account in the stock assessment and management of fisheries.},

Abstract = {Inhomogeneities in the temperature series from Beijing and Shanghai are

   for Beijing and -0.33 to 0.3 degreesC for Shanghai Annual mean and
   extreme temperature series are deduced from the daily observations and
   trends in the adjusted and unadjusted series are compared. The adjusted
   yearly mean temperatures show a warming trend of 0.5 degreesC / century
   since the turn of this century and an enhanced one of 2.0 degreesC /
   century since the 1960s. In contrast, the unadjusted data show a twice
   this value trend for Shanghai but little trend for Beijing at the
   long-term scale and overestimate the recent warming by 90\%-130\%.
   Beijing experienced a decrease of frequency of the extremes together
   with a cooling during the 1940s-1970s and an increase of frequency of
   extremes together with a warming since then. The trends of frequency of
   extremes at Shanghai were more or less opposite. It is implied that the

Title = {Robustness of CMIP6 Historical Global Mean Temperature Simulations:
   Trends, Long-Term Persistence, Autocorrelation, and Distributional Shape},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Multi-model climate experiments carried out as part of different phases
   of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) are crucial to
   evaluate past and future climate change. The reliability of models'
   simulations is often gauged by their ability to reproduce the historical
   climate across many time scales. This study compares the global mean
   surface air temperature from 29 CMIP6 models with observations from
   three datasets. We examine (1) warming and cooling rates in five
   subperiods from 1880 to 2014, (2) autocorrelation and long-term
   persistence, (3) models' performance based on probabilistic and entropy
   metrics, and (4) the distributional shape of temperature. All models
   simulate the observed long-term warming trend from 1880 to 2014. The
   late twentieth century warming (1975-2014) and the hiatus (1942-1975)
   are replicated by most models. The post-1998 warming is overestimated in
   90\% of the simulations. Only six out of 29 models reproduce the
   observed long-term persistence. All models show differences in
   distributional shape when compared with observations. Varying
   performance across metrics reveals the challenge to determine the
   ``best{''} model. Thus, we argue that models should be selected, based
   on case-specific metrics, depending on the intended use. Metrics
   proposed here facilitate a comprehensive assessment for various
   applications.},

Abstract = {Air-sea fluxes from the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4)
   are compared with the Coordinated Ocean-Ice Reference Experiment (CORE)
   dataset to assess present-day mean biases, variability errors, and late
   twentieth-century trend differences. CCSM4 is improved over the previous
   version, CCSM3, in both air-sea heat and freshwater fluxes in some
   regions; however, a large increase in net shortwave radiation into the
   ocean may contribute to an enhanced hydrological cycle. The authors
   provide a new baseline for assessment of flux variance at annual and
   interannual frequency bands in future model versions and contribute a
   new metric for assessing the coupling between the atmospheric and
   oceanic planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes of any climate model.
   Maps of the ratio of CCSM4 variance to CORE reveal that variance on
   annual time scales has larger error than on interannual time scales and
   that different processes cause errors in mean, annual, and interannual
   frequency bands. Air temperature and specific humidity in the CCSM4
   atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) follow the sea surface conditions much
   more closely than is found in CORE. Sensible and latent heat fluxes are
   less of a negative feedback to sea surface temperature warming in the
   CCSM4 than in the CORE data with the model's PBL allowing for more
   heating of the ocean's surface.},

Title = {A Spatio-Temporal Model for Mean, Anomaly, and Trend Fields of North
   Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {104},
Number = {485},
Pages = {5-18},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We consider the problem of fitting a statistical model to 30 years of
   sea Surface temperature records collected over a large portion of the
   Northern Atlantic. The observations were collected sparsely in space and
   time with different levels of accuracy. The purpose of the model is to
   produce an atlas of oceanic properties, including climatological mean
   fields, estimates of historical trends, and a spatio-temporal
   reconstruction of the anomalies, i.e., the transient deviations from the
   climatological mean. These products are of interest to climate change
   and climate variability research, numerical modeling, and remote sensing
   analyses. Our model improves upon the current tools used by
   oceanographers in that it constructs instantaneous temperature fields
   before averaging them into the climatology, thus giving equal weight to
   all years in the time frame, regardless of the temporal distribution of
   data. It also accounts for nonisotropic and nonstationary space and time
   dependencies, owing to its use of discrete process convolutions.
   Particular attention is given to the handling of massive datasets such
   as the one under study. This is achieved by considering compact support
   kernels that allow an efficient parallelization of the Markov chain
   Monte Carlo method used in the estimation of the model parameters.
   Resulting monthly climatologics are compared with those of the World
   Ocean Atlas 2001, version 2. Different water masses appear better
   separated in our climatology, and a close link emerges between the
   kernels' shape and the dominating patterns of ocean currents. The
   subpolar and the temperate North Atlantic display opposite trends, with
   the former mainly cooling over the years and the latter mainly warming,
   especially in the Gulf Stream region. Long-term changes in annual cycles
   are also detected. As in any hierarchical Bayesian model, parameter
   estimates come with credibility intervals, which are useful to compare
   results with other approaches and detect areas where sampling campaigns
   are needed the most.},

Abstract = {Temperature and ozone trends in the stratosphere are investigated using
   Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) aboard Upper Atmospheric Research
   Satellite (UARS) observations for the period 1992-2004, over the tropics
   of Northern Hemisphere (0-30 degrees N). The regression analysis of
   temperature time series indicates a significant annual cooling trend of
   1-3 K/decade in the free stratosphere. A cooling trend of similar to 2
   +/- 0.6 K/decade near 25 km which increases with altitude to reach a
   maximum around 35 km and then decreases to 1 +/- 1.1 K/decade near
   stratopause is computed: The observed maximum cooling trend near 35 km
   may be viewed with caution due to the change over of temperature from
   National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data to
   HALOE instrument. A statistically significant decreasing ozone trend in
   the lower stratosphere is also obtained which becomes negligible above
   40 km. Attempt has been made to compute the seasonal trend components in
   both temperature and ozone. Seasonal distribution of temperature trends
   shows a maximum cooling during winter. The largest negative ozone trend
   is found during autumn with a peak (8-10\% per decade) near 30 km. (c)

Abstract = {In this work, relationships for enthalpy changes and entropy changes
   associated with phase transitions, specifically for alkanes, alcohols,

   correlations were observed between: enthalpy and entropy change,
   enthalpy change and number of carbon atoms, and entropy change and
   number of carbon atoms. The observed correlations are explained in terms
   of the molecular structure, especially the functional group. For a given
   number of carbon atoms, common behavior regarding enthalpy change (and
   entropy change) was also observed if the functional group changed, for
   alcohols, even for multiple functional groups, and for alkanes, even if
   branched. The investigations thus show general, common phase change
   behavior, and significantly improve the empirical description and

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {Presenting temperature data using recently introduced innovative polygon
   trend analysis (IPTA) can improve our understanding of the effects of
   climate change. This method was applied to analyze temperature trends at
   six stations in Turkey: Istanbul (17,064), Ankara (17,131), Bursa
   (17,116), Iznik (17,661), Gemilik (17,663), and Sakarya (17,069). At
   station 17,064, there was an increasing trend in temperature data for
   seven months, while only one month showed a decreasing trend, and the
   remainder presented no trend. For station 17,131, there was a decreasing
   trend for two months, an increasing trend for five months, and no trend
   for the remaining months. At station 17,116, an increasing trend was
   present for nine months, with a decreasing trend for two months and only
   one month indicating no trend. An increasing trend over seven months was
   noted at station 17,661, while two and three months showed a decreasing
   and no trend, respectively. For station 17,663, there was an increasing
   trend for nine months, one month showed no trend, and two months
   presented a decreasing trend. At station 17,069, five, four, and three
   months showed increasing, decreasing, and no trends, respectively. The
   gene expression programming (GEP) model was tested to predict the
   short-term monthly average temperature for this dataset. The proposed
   GEP model presented good prediction results for all selected stations by
   tracing the relationship with a coefficient of determination (R-Sq) >=
   0.90. Trend analysis by IPTA can help understand temperature trends
   better, aiding future decision-making, and the GEP model can effectively
   predict short-term values.},

Title = {An ``Observational Large Ensemble'' to Compare Observed and Modeled
   Temperature Trend Uncertainty due to Internal Variability},

Abstract = {Estimates of the climate response to anthropogenic forcing contain
   irreducible uncertainty due to the presence of internal variability.
   Accurate quantification of this uncertainty is critical for both
   contextualizing historical trends and determining the spread of climate
   projections. The contribution of internal variability to uncertainty in
   trends can be estimated in models as the spread across an initial
   condition ensemble. However, internal variability simulated by a model
   may be inconsistent with observations due to model biases. Here,
   statistical resampling methods are applied to observations in order to
   quantify uncertainty in historical 50-yr (1966-2015) winter near-surface
   air temperature trends over North America related to incomplete sampling
   of internal variability. This estimate is compared with the simulated
   trend uncertainty in the NCAR CESM1 Large Ensemble (LENS). The
   comparison suggests that uncertainty in trends due to internal
   variability is largely overestimated in LENS, which has an average
   amplification of variability of 32\% across North America. The
   amplification of variability is greatest in the western United States
   and Alaska. The observationally derived estimate of trend uncertainty is
   combined with the forced signal from LENS to produce an ``Observational
   Large Ensemble'' (OLENS). The members of OLENS indicate the range of
   observationally constrained, spatially consistent temperature trends
   that could have been observed over the past 50 years if a different
   sequence of internal variability had unfolded. The smaller trend
   uncertainty in OLENS suggests that is easier to detect the historical
   climate change signal in observations than in any given member of LENS.},

Title = {Characterizing the urban temperature trend using seasonal unit root
   analysis: Hong Kong from 1970 to 2015},

Abstract = {This paper explores urban temperature in Hong Kong using long-term time
   series. In particular, the characterization of the urban temperature
   trend was investigated using the seasonal unit root analysis of monthly
   mean air temperature data over the period January 1970 to December 2013.
   The seasonal unit root test makes it possible to determine the
   stochastic trend of monthly temperatures using an autoregressive model.
   The test results showed that mean air temperature has increased by
   0.169au broken vertical bar C (10 yr)(-1) over the past four decades.
   The model of monthly temperature obtained from the seasonal unit root
   analysis was able to explain 95.9\% of the variance in the measured
   monthly data - much higher than the variance explained by the ordinary
   least-squares model using annual mean air temperature data and other
   studies alike. The model accurately predicted monthly mean air
   temperatures between January 2014 and December 2015 with a
   root-mean-square percentage error of 4.2\%. The correlation between the
   predicted and the measured monthly mean air temperatures was 0.989. By
   analyzing the monthly air temperatures recorded at an urban site and a
   rural site, it was found that the urban heat island effect led to the
   urban site being on average 0.865au broken vertical bar C warmer than
   the rural site over the past two decades. Besides, the results of
   correlation analysis showed that the increase in annual mean air
   temperature was significantly associated with the increase in
   population, gross domestic product, urban land use, and energy use, with
   the R-2 values ranging from 0.37 to 0.43.},

Abstract = {Ground temperature's sensitivity to climate change has garnered
   attention. This study aimed to monitor and analyze temporal trends and
   estimate Active Layer Thickness from a monitoring point at Fildes
   Peninsula, King George Island, in Antarctica. Quality control and
   consistency analysis were performed on the data. Methods such as serial
   autocorrelation, Mann-Kendall, Sen-Slope, Pettitt, and regression
   analysis tests were applied. Spearman's correlation examined the
   relationship between air temperature and ground depths. The active layer
   thickness was estimated using the maximum monthly temperature, and the
   permafrost lower limit used the minimum monthly temperature. Significant
   summer seasonal trends were observed with Mann- Kendall tau, positive
   Sen-Slope, and Pettitt slope at depths of 67.5 and 83.5 cm. The
   regression analysis was significant and positive for all ground depths
   and in different seasons. The highest correlation (r=0.82) between air
   temperature and surface ground depth was found. Freezing prevailed at
   all depths during 2008-2018. The average Active Layer Thickness (ALT)
   was 92.61 cm. Temperature is difficult to monitor, and its estimation is
   still complex. However, it stands out as a fundamental element for
   studies that refer to the impacts of climate change},

Title = {Seasonal trends and phenology shifts in sea surface temperature on the

Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {The northeastern North American continental shelf from Cape Hatteras to
   the Scotian Shelf is a region of globally extreme positive trends in sea
   surface temperature (SST). Here, a 33-year (1982-2014) time series of
   daily satellite SST data was used to quantify and map spatial patterns
   in SST trends and phenology over this shelf. Strongest trends are over
   the Scotian Shelf (>0.6 degrees C decade(-1)) and Gulf of Maine (>0.4
   degrees C decade(-1)) with weaker trends over the inner Mid-Atlantic
   Bight (similar to 0.3 degrees C decade(-1)). Winter (January-April)
   trends are relatively weak, and even negative in some areas; early
   summer (May-June) trends are positive everywhere, and later summer
   (July-September) trends are strongest (similar to 1.0 degrees C
   decade(-1)). These seasonal differences shift the phenology of many
   metrics of the SST cycle. The yearday on which specific temperature
   thresholds (8 degrees and 12 degrees C) are reached in spring trends
   earlier, most strongly over the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine (similar
   to-0.5 days year(-1)). Three metrics defining the warmest summer period
   show significant trends towards earlier summer starts, later summer ends
   and longer summer duration over the entire study region. Trends in start
   and end dates are strongest (similar to 1 day year(-1)) over the Gulf of
   Maine and Scotian Shelf. Trends in increased summer duration are >2.0
   days year(-1) in parts of the Gulf of Maine. Regression analyses show
   that phenology trends have regionally varying links to the North
   Atlantic Oscillation, to local spring and summer atmospheric pressure
   and air temperature and to Gulf Stream position. For effective
   monitoring and management of dynamically heterogeneous shelf regions,
   the results highlight the need to quantify spatial and seasonal
   differences in SST trends as well as trends in SST phenology, each of
   which likely has implications for the ecological functioning of the
   shelf.},

Abstract = {Pristine mountain environments are more sensitive to climate change than
   other land surfaces. Climatic variations in mountainous terrain are
   still poorly understood. Previous studies revealed inconsistent findings
   on the elevational dependence of warming in the mountains. In this
   study, the trends and elevational dependence of air temperature in the
   Cariboo Mountains Region (CMR) of British Columbia are explored using a
   surface air temperature dataset with a spatial resolution of five arc
   minutes over the 1950-2010 period. A Mann-Kendall test is performed for
   evaluation of trends and their significance. In recent decades the CMR
   has been warming at a faster rate than regional and global warming. The
   minimum air temperature trend shows significant amplified warming at
   higher elevations. The snow-albedo feedback and changes in cloud cover
   over the CMR may possibly be the major physical mechanisms responsible
   for these trends. The implications of such changes on the endangered
   mountain caribou and water resources of the area are also discussed.},

Title = {Temperature trends and recent decline in body size of the stone marten
   <i>Martes foina</i> in Denmark},
Journal = {MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {146-150},
Abstract = {We studied a. sample of 131 skulls of the stone marten Martes foina that
   were collected in Denmark between 1858 and 1999. Data were available for
   37 years, but collection effort was not uniform throughout the study
   period and annual sample size varied between I and 27. We used principal
   component analysis (PCA) to combine the information Of four skull
   measurements into a single variable (PC 1). PC I was then corrected for
   factors that significantly affected it (sex and longitude), and residual
   PCI was used for further analysis in which we calculated trends in PCI
   values during the study period. During the study period there was an
   increase in mean annual temperature in Denmark, but this increase was
   not continuous, as there was slight decrease in temperature between 1947
   and 1965.
   We found that skull size (and by implication body size) of the stone
   marten in Denmark had two periods of decrease and these two periods
   coincide with the periods of increase in mean annual temperature. These
   results may indicate that body size of the stone marten is sensitive to
   the change in ambient temperature, either due to a change in food
   availability that was caused by the increase in temperature, or
   decreased its size in accordance with Bergmann's rule. (C) 2008 Deutsche

Title = {Latitudinal Trend Analysis of Land Surface Temperature to Identify Urban
   Heat Pockets in Global Coastal Megacities},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent global warming has led to increased coastal disturbances through
   a significant transfer of heat between the land and the ocean surface.
   The polar regions show excessive temperature changes resulting in
   massive ice sheet melting. Mid-latitudinal storms pull heat away from
   the equator towards the poles; therefore, the global sea level is
   rising, making coastal cities the most vulnerable. In last few decades,
   rapid urbanization in big cities has drastically changed the land cover
   and land use due to deforestation, which has led to increased land
   surface temperatures (LSTs). This eventually leads to urban flooding due
   to oceanic storm surges frequently created by low pressure over the
   ocean during summer. This paper considered factors such as drastic
   unplanned urbanization to analyze coastal cities as the focal point of
   the generation of heat yielding the annihilation of the natural
   topography. Urban heat pockets (UHP) were studied for nine megacities,
   which were selected at an interval of 5 degrees of latitudinal
   difference in the northern hemisphere (NH) since 70\% of densely
   populated megacities are located in coastal regions. A comparative
   surface temperature analysis was effectively carried out with the same
   latitudinal reference for nine mid-sized cities using the derived LST
   data from Landsat 8. The results provide a comparative classification of
   surface temperature variations across the coastal cities over the NH.
   This study infers that the issues pertaining to growing urbanization are
   very important for analyzing the proportional impact caused by the
   settlement hierarchy and lays a robust foundation for advanced studies
   of global warming in coastal urban environments.},

Title = {Surface Temperature Trend Estimation over 12 Sites in Guinea Using 57
   Years of Ground-Based Data},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Trend-Run model was performed to estimate the trend in surface
   temperatures recorded at 12 sites in Guinea from 1960 to 2016 and to
   examine the contribution of each climate forcing. The coefficient of
   determination (R-2) calculated varies between 0.60 and 0.90, it provides
   total information about the simulation capability of the model. The
   decadal trend values also calculated show an upward trend (between 0.04
   degrees C +/- 0.06 degrees C decade(-1) and 0.21 degrees C +/- 0.06
   degrees C decade(-1)). In addition, forcings' contributions were
   quantified, and the annual oscillation (AO) contribution is higher for
   most of the stations, followed by semiannual oscillation (SAO). Among
   the forcings, the tropical Northern Atlantic (TNA) contribution is
   greater than that of the sunspot number (SSN), Nino3.4 and Atlantic Nino
   (AN). Moreover, the Mann-Kendall test revealed a positive significant
   trend for all stations except at the Macenta site. Additionally, with
   sequential Mann-Kendall test, trend turning points were found only for
   the stations of Mamou, Koundara and Macenta at different dates. The
   temperature anomalies depict warming episodes (1970s, 1980s, 1984 and
   1990s). Since then, the temperature is consistently increasing over the
   country. A significant warming has been shown, which might be further
   investigated using these models with additional contributing factors.},

Abstract = {The vertical profiles and trends of temperature, wind direction and wind
   speed up to 30 km altitude are investigated by using the radiosonde data
   collected over the South Pole during the period from 1987 through 2017.
   The multi-year averaged data showed that the temperature had a
   significant seasonal variation with the highest (lowest) temperature in
   southern hemisphere summer (winter). The highest (lowest) temperature in
   the lower troposphere was approximately -25 degrees C (-60 degrees C) in
   January (July) at a height of about 500 m above the surface (at
   surface). The annual mean temperature showed a warming trend of 0. 3
   degrees C per decade at surface, but the trends kept decreasing with
   increasing height, and turned to negative (-0. 25 degrees C/decade) in
   the upper troposphere. For the height averaged temperature in the whole
   troposphere, the most apparent increasing trend occurred in autumn,
   reaching 0. 55 degrees C/decade, while the yearly averaged temperature
   had a trend of about 0.3 degrees C/decade. Throughout all the seasons
   there were the dominant northerlies to easterlies close to the surface,
   north-westerlies (westerlies to southerlies) at lower (upper)
   troposphere, and southerlies (southerlies to easterlies) in lower
   (upper) stratosphere. Near surface more northerlies and less easterlies
   were recorded, and less southerlies but more easterlies and northerlies
   occurred in higher levels. The wind speed near surface was frequently in
   2 similar to 10 m . s(-1) range. Around 6 similar to 9 km above mean sea
   level a tropopause jet up to 25 m . s(-1) was observed. In the upper
   stratosphere, strong winds larger than 30 m . s(-1) sometimes appeared.
   The correlation coefficient between seasonal/yearly wind speed and
   temperature gradient was negative (positive) over South Pole at the
   height section of surface -10 km (10 similar to 30 km). The seasonal and
   height averaged wind speed of the whole troposphere showed increasing
   trends in the recent 30 years, and similar to temperature, the most
   significant trend occurred in autumn, reaching 0. 59 m . s(-1)/decade,
   while the mildest trend appeared in spring with a value of only 0. 05 m
   . s(-1)/decade. For the yearly and height averaged wind speed of the
   whole troposphere, there was an increasing trend of 0. 24 m .
   s(-1)/decade. The annual mean surface wind speed increased at a rate of
   0. 05 m . s(-1)/decade.},

Abstract = {Assessing groundwater flow path in a thermal aquifer, such as El Hamma
   aquifer, southeastern Tunisia, and its lateral communication with the
   adjacent Jeffara-Gabes aquifers, is a very complex operation which
   requires the integration of several approaches to understand and explain
   the reality of phenomenon. In this study, geochemical and isotopic data,
   Kohonen self-organizing map, temperature cooling trend, and kriging
   techniques were used to assess groundwater flow path in hydrothermal
   aquifer of El Hamma-Gabes, Tunisia. For this objective, 32 sampled wells
   are analyzed for major ions, electric conductivity, pH, total dissolved
   solids, and stables isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18). Geochemical
   diagrams reveal that groundwater chemistry was controlled by
   evaporation, and rock-water interaction with a dominant water facies was
   Cl center dot SO4-Na center dot Ca-Mg. Kriging techniques were used to
   highlight groundwater flow path. Kohonen self-organizing map shows that
   the waters are clustered into three classes according to chemical and
   isotopic composition. These clusters represent a hydrothermal
   groundwater class from the Continental Intercalaire aquifer, a shallow
   groundwater class corresponding to Jeffara-Gabes aquifer and mixed water
   class. Groundwater cooling trend and stable isotopes indicate that
   groundwater flow is toward west to east part of study area, indicating a
   recharge of Jeffara aquifer from El Hamma thermal aquifer.},

Title = {Longitudinal Asymmetric Trends of Tropical Cold-Point Tropopause
   Temperature and Their Link to Strengthened Walker Circulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {21},
Pages = {7755-7771},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The zonal structure of trends in the tropical tropopause layer during
   1979-2014 is investigated by using reanalysis datasets and
   chemistry-climatemodel simulations. The analysis herein reveals that the
   tropical cold-point tropopause temperature (CPTT) trends during
   1979-2014 are zonally asymmetric; that is, over the tropical central and
   eastern Pacific (CEP; 20 degrees S-20 degrees N, 160 degrees E-100
   degrees W), the CPTT shows an increasing trend of 0.22K decade(-1),
   whereas over the rest of the tropical regions (non-CEP regions) the CPTT
   shows a decreasing trend of -0.08K decade(-1). Model simulations suggest
   that this zonal asymmetry in the tropical CPTT trends can be partly
   attributed to Walker circulation (WC) changes induced by zonally
   asymmetric changes of the sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The
   increasing (decreasing) SSTs over thewestern Pacific (CEP) result in a
   larger zonal gradient in sea level pressure over the tropical Pacific
   and intensified surface easterlies. The increased pressure gradient
   leads to enhanced convection over the Indo-Pacific warm pool and
   weakened convection over the CEP, facilitating a stronger WC. The
   downward branch of the intensified WC induces a dynamical warming over
   the CEP and the upward branch of the intensified WC induces a dynamical
   cooling over the non-CEP regions below 150 hPa. The significant warming
   in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) caused by the WC
   descending and wave activity changes in the UTLS over the CEP shifts the
   cold-point tropopause height to a higher level, while the radiative
   effects of greenhouse gases, ozone, and water vapor changes in the UTLS
   make less important contributions to the trend of the tropical CPTT than
   SST changes.},

Volume = {128},

Abstract = {Few coastal systems have time series data that allow researchers to
   examine the impact of two important stressors on estuarine ecosystems:
   climate change and eutrophication. The Central Basin of Long Island
   Sound (LIS), between New York and Connecticut, is one such system. LIS
   has seen annual average surface temperatures increase at a rate of 0.03
   degrees C/yr since 1976, with increases most pronounced during summer
   and early fall. Over the past 15 years, annual stratification
   (difference between mean annual surface and bottom temperatures) has
   also increased at the same rate. Despite expansion of waste-water
   treatment and declining point-source nutrient input, LIS remains
   eutrophic. An increase toward historic mean annual chlorophyll
   concentration has occurred since a minimum in the early 1990s, driven in
   part by higher fall chlorophyll values. There is also an apparent shift
   in the seasonality of phytoplankton blooms, with more frequent fall
   chlorophyll peaks and reduced early spring peaks relative to the 1950s.
   Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) analysis of phytoplankton
   communities from fall and summer 2002-8 indicated that cyanobacteria and
   flagellates are associated with higher amounts of chlorophyll at higher
   temperatures during these two seasons. These results suggest that as
   surface temperatures continue to increase, smaller cells and flagellates
   may maintain chlorophyll values at higher levels despite decreased or
   static surface nutrient concentrations in this system. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Influence of changes in sea ice concentration and cloud cover on recent
   Arctic surface temperature trends},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {The influence of trends in sea ice concentration ( SIC) and cloud cover
   on trends in surface temperature over the Arctic Ocean from 1982 to 2004
   is investigated analytically, and evaluated empirically with satellite
   products. The results demonstrate that changes in SIC and cloud cover
   played major roles in the magnitude of recent Arctic surface temperature
   trends. Significant surface warming associated with sea ice loss, over
   0.9 K decade(-1), is found over the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in autumn,
   accounting for most of the observed 1.1 K decade(-1) warming trend. If
   the mean SIC over the Arctic Ocean in each season is reduced by half,
   our analysis shows that the surface temperature will increase by
   approximately 10 K in winter and 6 K in spring and autumn. In winter,
   surface temperature trends associated with changes in cloud cover are
   negative over most of the Arctic Ocean, and with cloud cover trends
   explaining -0.91 out of -1.2 K decade(-1) of the surface temperature
   cooling. In spring, 0.55 K decade(-1) of the total 1.0 K decade(-1)
   warming can be attributed to the trend associated with cloud cover
   changes. After eliminating the effects of changes in SIC and cloud cover
   on surface temperature trends, the residual surface temperature trends
   can be used in a more robust diagnosis of surface warming or cooling in
   the Arctic. The same procedure can be applied to study the impact of
   changes in sea ice thickness, ocean inflow, and other parameters on the
   temperature trends, and to completely different sets of climate
   variables, whether they are measured or modeled. Citation: Liu, Y., J.

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},

Abstract = {This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in extreme values of
   relative humidity (RH), temperature, temperature-humidity index (THI)
   and the effect of climatic variables on THI in the northern parts of
   Iran from 1986 to 2016. The THI was generated for each of the 30
   meteorological stations. Previously, trend analysis was calculated in
   different seasons using quantile regression. For the most part, the
   results indicate a declining and rising trend in RH and temperature,
   respectively. The highest percentage of decreasing trend slopes was for
   maximum RH (<=-50 \%), but for maximum temperature, the highest
   percentage of increasing slopes in summer and winter (>= 30 \%) was
   identified on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. However, a
   decreasing trend (\%<=-15) was detected for the maximum temperature in
   autumn. The highest increasing (decreasing) trend slope of THI (30 \%
   and -30 \%) was for low values of THI in spring and winter (autumn and
   winter). The minimum and maximum temperatures positively affected THI in
   all seasons, and the value of the effect coefficient was higher in the
   coastal areas. Also, high values of minimum RH in the spring, summer,
   autumn, and winter seasons had a positive (negative) effect in 73, 100,
   33, and 0 \% (26, 0, 66, and 100 \%) of the stations, respectively. But
   the maximum RH had a positive (negative) effect on 80, 100, 33, and 6 \%
   (20, 0, 66, and 93 \%) of stations, respectively. The findings of this
   study are generally helpful in identifying changes in weather extremes
   and their effects on human health.},

Abstract = {According to data obtained from meteorological towers, Brazil has
   significantly increased temperature in the past 20 years, particularly
   in the North and Midwest regions. Vapor pressure deficit and
   evapotranspiration were also analyzed, showing an increase across the
   entire country, confirming that the air is becoming drier. This warming
   trend is part of the global climate change phenomenon caused by the rise
   of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, fires, poor soil management
   practices, deforestation, and logging. The increase in temperature and
   dryness has profoundly impacted Brazil's climate and ecosystems, leading
   to intensified extreme weather events and changes in the distribution of
   both animal and plant species. This study highlights the importance of
   utilizing meteorological tower data to monitor and understand the
   effects of climate change in Brazil. It emphasizes the need for
   immediate action to address its causes and mitigate its negative

Abstract = {Over the past 100 years, especially in the recent 20 years, the global
   average surface temperature has increased significantly, and global
   warming has become an important issue of global concern. In this paper,
   multiple sine functions decomposition (MSFD) method is presented to
   forecast the colder-winter years of Guangzhou. MSFD method is an
   effective forecasting method, which has been applied to long-term
   temperature trend forecasting as well as temperature data restoration.
   Generally, the MFSD method firstly decomposes a historical temperature
   sequence into multiple sine functions. Then, by adding up those learning
   or fitting sine functions, a temperature model is constructed to
   forecast future temperature. Based on the data of the
   monthly-temperature (MT) from 1951 to 2014, a sequence (or say, set) of
   future temperature data is shown in this paper via the MSFD method. The
   result exhibits Guangzhou's temperature trend in the next three decades,
   and it matches the trend of global warming well. At the same time,
   several potential colder-winter years are pointed out.},

Abstract = {Temperature monitoring provides important information for the
   sustainable management of a geothermal field. Previous studies indicate
   that a decline in aquifer pressure is an obvious indicator of thermal
   water overexploitation. However, many thermal water producing aquifers
   display a subtle temperature change rather than a pressure decline. Due
   to the importance of monitoring temperature change, temperature
   detection is an important topic in the sustainable management of
   geothermal fields. In this study, we used borehole temperature-depth
   curves, obtained from boreholes measured over half-year intervals from
   2011 to 2014, as well as the Mann-Kendall method, to determine trends
   for subsurface temperature within the Jiashi Hot Spring in Taiwan. Our
   results indicate that trends for subsurface temperature are related to
   hydrogeology and the flow field of groundwater. Groundwater/thermal
   water flow directions are impacted by the exploitation of thermal water
   in production wells, according to their depths and distributions, but
   pressure declines are not a dominant feature. Repeatedly measured
   borehole temperature-depths and their resultant curves provide important
   information for understanding trends in subsurface temperature change
   within a geothermal field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Historical variability in sea surface temperature (SST) in the North
   Atlantic (NA) is examined using trend and Empirical Orthogonal Function
   (EOF) analyses of annual and summer means from three interpolated
   monthly datasets: Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature
   (HadISST1), Extended Reconstruction of SST (ERSST), and Centennial in
   situ Observation-Based Estimates (COBE). Comparisons with time series of
   upper-ocean temperature from four monitoring sites off Atlantic Canada
   reveal substantial similarity in the interannual to multi-decadal
   variability but notable differences in the longer-term trends. The
   magnitude of decadal-scale variability is comparable to, or greater
   than, the long-term changes in all of the datasets; together with the
   trend discrepancies, this needs to be considered in climate change
   applications. Averaged over the NA, the annual means have a long-term
   increasing trend and a pronounced multi-decadal variation, resembling
   those in global mean (land-ocean) surface temperature and the Atlantic
   Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). There is remarkable similarity in the
   spatial and temporal variability of the three leading EOF modes from the
   different gridded datasets, with the first highly correlated with the
   AMO, the second modestly correlated with the winter North Atlantic
   Oscillation, and the third apparently related to ocean circulation
   variability. Trends since 1981 are generally two to three times larger
   than those since 1900 and 1950, which is at least partly related to the
   phase of the AMO. Trends in the summer means are generally larger than
   in the annual means. Overall, the results provide support for both
   anthropogenic global warming and decadal-scale natural variations making
   important contributions to ocean climate variability in the Northwest
   Atlantic.},

Title = {Comparison of Radiosonde and GCM Vertical Temperature Trend Profiles:
   Effects of Dataset Choice and Data Homogenization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {21},
Number = {20},
Pages = {5417-5435},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In comparisons of radiosonde vertical temperature trend profiles with
   comparable profiles derived from selected Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) general circulation
   models (GCMs) driven by major external forcings of the latter part of
   the twentieth century, model trends exhibit a positive bias relative to
   radiosonde trends in the majority of cases for both time periods
   examined (1960-99 and 1979-99). Homogeneity adjustments made in the
   Radiosonde Atmospheric Temperature Products for Assessing Climate
   (RATPAC) and Hadley Centre Atmospheric Temperatures, version 2 (HadAT2),
   radiosonde datasets, which are applied by dataset developers to account
   for time-varying biases introduced by historical changes in instruments
   and measurement practices, reduce the relative bias in most cases.
   Although some differences were found between the two observed datasets,
   in general the observed trend profiles were more similar to one another
   than either was to the GCM profiles.
   In the troposphere, adjustment has a greater impact on improving
   agreement of the shapes of the trend profiles than on improving
   agreement of the layer mean trends, whereas in the stratosphere the
   opposite is true. Agreement between the shapes of GCM and radiosonde
   trend profiles is generally better in the stratosphere than the
   troposphere, with more complexity to the profiles in the latter than the
   former. In the troposphere the tropics exhibit the poorest agreement
   between GCM and radiosonde trend profiles, but also the largest
   improvement in agreement resulting from homogeneity adjustment.
   In the stratosphere, radiosonde trends indicate more cooling than GCMs.
   For the 1979-99 period, a disproportionate amount of this discrepancy
   arises several months after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, at which
   time temperatures in the radiosonde time series cool abruptly by similar
   to 0.5 K compared to those derived from GCMs, and this difference
   persists to the end of the record.},

   data and subdivided into climatological series from 1971 to 2006 and
   1981 to 2016. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used to verify
   trends. A positive trend was observed for the Mann-Kendall test for the
   months of January, February, March, April, June, September, October and
   December of 1971 to 2006 and for the years 1981 to 2016 only the months
   of March and June presented a trend temperature increase. The Pettitt
   test indicated a sudden change in the data series coinciding with most
   of the months that showed a tendency to increase the minimum air
   temperature by the Mann-Kendall test in the years 1971 to 2006. From
   1981 to 2016 the Pettitt test indicated the months of March and June
   with changes in the minimum air temperature, this result also coincided

Abstract = {Lying in the north boundary of China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
   Region is highly sensitive to climate change, which is greatly
   influenced by the new features of present-day and future extreme
   temperature events. Based on daily temperature records of 108
   meteorological station from 1961 to 2009 and future projections under
   the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios from the
   regional climate modeling system PRECIS in high-resolution (\~{} 50 km
   in horizon), the observed and projected changes in temperature-related
   extreme climate events over Inner Mongolia are investigated for the
   present day, the mid-twentieth (2041\~{}2060) century, and the late
   twenty-first (2071-2090) century. Temperature extremes associated with a
   warming tendency all show as increasing trend by a slope of around 0.2,
   especially for growing season length which has a slope of 0.36 at
   present, and these extreme events are projected to increase with an
   extension of 5 more warm days during the mid-twenty-first century before
   increasing less sharply in the late twenty-first century under the
   RCP2.6 scenario, while the increase of warming extremes are projected as
   around 15, 30 over most Inner Mongolia, particularly for southwest
   parts, with an increase over 30, 45 at the end of twenty-first century
   under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively. Temperature extremes
   concomitant with a cooling tendency change with a slope of - 0.261 and -
   0.421 for icing and frost days in present-day, and are likely to display
   a contrary trend as warm extremes over two periods under the RCP2.6
   scenario, with a decrease of 10 cold days over the whole Inner Mongolia.
   While the mid-twenty-first century would go through minor changes of
   cold extreme as the RCP2.6 scenario under both the RCP4.5 and 8.5
   scenarios, the late twenty-first century would witness most dramatic
   decrease of cold extremes, more specifically, with over 20 and 30 less
   cold days separately over most areas and particularly over 35 less cold
   days in central and southwest regions. Since the control of greenhouse
   gas emissions halts the increase of warming extremes and higher emission
   scenarios lead to more warm extremes, the benefits and risks of warming
   trend for central plantation areas and southwest desert regions of Inner
   Mongolia should be considered comprehensively by local policy making and
   social-economic development planning.},

Title = {An Analysis of Land Surface Temperature Trends in the Central Himalayan
   Region Based on MODIS Products},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {The scientific community has widely reported the impacts of climate
   change on the Central Himalaya. To qualify and quantify these effects,
   long-term land surface temperature observations in both the daytime and
   nighttime, acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   from 2000 to 2017, were used in this study to investigate the
   spatiotemporal variations and their changing mechanism. Two periodic
   parameters, the mean annual surface temperature (MAST) and the annual
   maximum temperature (MAXT), were derived based on an annual temperature
   cycle model to reduce the influences from the cloud cover and were used
   to analyze their trend during the period. The general thermal
   environment represented by the average MAST indicated a significant
   spatial distribution pattern along with the elevation gradient. Behind
   the clear differences in the daytime and nighttime temperatures at
   different physiographical regions, the trend test conducted with the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) method showed that most of the areas with significant
   changes showed an increasing trend, and the nighttime temperatures
   exhibited a more significant increasing trend than the daytime
   temperatures, for both the MAST and MAXT, according to the changing
   areas. The nighttime changing areas were more widely distributed (more
   than 28\%) than the daytime changing areas (around 10\%). The average
   change rates of the MAST and MAXT in the daytime are 0.102 degrees C/yr
   and 0.190 degrees C/yr, and they are generally faster than those in the
   nighttime (0.048 degrees C/yr and 0.091 degrees C/yr, respectively). The
   driving force analysis suggested that urban expansion, shifts in the
   courses of lowland rivers, and the retreat of both the snow and glacier
   cover presented strong effects on the local thermal environment, in
   addition to the climatic warming effect. Moreover, the strong
   topographic gradient greatly influenced the change rate and evidenced a
   significant elevation-dependent warming effect, especially for the
   nighttime LST. Generally, this study suggested that the nighttime
   temperature was more sensitive to climate change than the daytime
   temperature, and this general warming trend clearly observed in the
   central Himalayan region could have important influences on local
   geophysical, hydrological, and ecological processes.},

Abstract = {In-situ observations of surface air temperature at 55 weather stations
   in Iran are analysed for homogeneity and trends over the period
   1960-2010. Among them 32 stations have data available for the whole
   period. The other 23 stations with shorter records are used only to
   confirm variability during overlapping periods. Discontinuities in the
   temperature series relate mostly to relocation and changes of
   environmental conditions at individual stations. These changes alter the
   statistical characteristics of temperature, including the mean,
   variance, and frequency distribution and introduce uncertainties in
   spatially averaged trends. This article determines new estimates of
   temperature trends over Iran after the detection of artificial change
   points and application of homogenization.
   The regional trend of temperature is estimated using seasonal and annual
   minimum and maximum temperature from stations that have identical
   variability across the country. The country may be segmented to 10 such
   regions in terms of trends and variability of temperature. There is
   little doubt that temperatures have increased in all regions at nearly
   equal rates of 0.4-0.5 and 0.2-0.3 (degrees C/decade) for minimum and
   maximum temperature, respectively in Iran. The finding in earlier work
   of a few individual stations with negative trends is found to be due to
   artificial effects such as relocation.},

Abstract = {Information on temperature and chlorophyll concentration at global or
   regional scales in a lake is fundamental for the study of freshwater.
   Investigating long-term trends and seasonal patterns in these variables
   is essential in order to describe changes in lake characteristics. In
   this paper, several modelling approaches which consist of parametric and
   nonparametric regression models are applied to determine the trends over
   time and seasonal patterns in each of these two variables, from 1987 to
   2005. Two sites of interest are Cailness and Creinch, which are located
   in the north and south basins, of Loch Lomond, respectively. The results
   show there is a significant trend in surface water temperature at
   Cailness. However, no significant trend is suggested in chlorophyll at
   both sites and there is evidence of constant seasonal patterns for all
   of the variables, at both sites.},

Title = {Methodology and results of calculating central california surface
   temperature trends: Evidence of human-induced climate change?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {19},

Pages = {548-563},

Abstract = {A procedure is described to construct time series of regional surface
   temperatures and is then applied to interior central California stations
   to test the hypothesis that century-scale trend differences between
   irrigated and nonirrigated regions may be identified. The procedure
   requires documentation of every point in time at which a discontinuity
   in a station record may have occurred through (a) the examination of
   metadata forms (e.g., station moves) and (b) simple statistical tests.
   From this `' homogeneous segments `' of temperature records for each
   station are defined. Biases are determined for each segment relative to
   all others through a method employing mathematical graph theory. The
   debiased segments are then merged, forming a complete regional time
   series. Time series of daily maximum and minimum temperatures for
   stations in the irrigated San Joaquin Valley (Valley) and nearby
   nonirrigated Sierra Nevada (Sierra) were generated for 1910-2003.
   Results show that twentieth-century Valley minimum temperatures are
   warming at a highly significant rate in all seasons, being greatest in
   summer and fall (> +0.25 degrees C decade(-1)). The Valley trend of
   annual mean temperatures is +0.07 degrees +/- 0.07 degrees C decade(-1).
   Sierra summer and fall minimum temperatures appear to be cooling, but at
   a less significant rate, while the trend of annual mean Sierra
   temperatures is an unremarkable -0.02 degrees +/- 0.10 degrees C
   decade(-1). A working hypothesis is that the relative positive trends in
   Valley minus Sierra minima (> 0.4 degrees C decade(-1) for summer and
   fall) are related to the altered surface environment brought about by
   the growth of irrigated agriculture, essentially changing a high-albedo
   desert into a darker, moister, vegetated plain.},

Abstract = {Much recent scientific focus has been on the impact of climate change on
   human and natural environments. However, a particular research gap that
   we address is evaluating the effect of global warming on land surface
   temperatures across different spatial contexts, such as elevation, in
   mountain regions. Our aim is to establish the effect of global warming
   on daytime land surface temperatures at various elevations and slope
   aspects of the central Alborz Mountains in northern Iran. The land
   surface temperature (LST) component is extracted from MODIS Terra sensor
   satellite images for the period 2001-2021 on a monthly basis (240 images
   were used). Results indicated that increasing surface temperature trends
   are more pronounced than decreasing trends. Significant increasing
   surface temperature trends are observed for the months of January
   through December and June through July. In contrast, October records
   significant decreasing trends across all study areas and geographic
   domains. Rates of surface temperature increases are lower in the
   northern zones compared to the southern zones of the Central Alborz, for
   elevations ranging from 1500 to 4000 m above sea level. A key finding is
   that global warming has increased surface temperatures on both the
   northern and southern aspects of the western and mid regions of the
   Central Alborz Mountains, while no changes are noted for the eastern
   region.},

Abstract = {Effective monitoring of drought plays an important role in water
   resources planning and management, especially under global warming
   effect. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of air temperature
   on historical long-term droughts in regions with diverse climates in
   Iran. To this end, monthly air temperature (T) and precipitation (P)
   data were gathered from 15 longest record meteorological stations in
   Iran covering the period 1951-2014. Long-term meteorological droughts
   behavior was quantified using two different drought indices, i.e. the
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized
   Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Linear and non-linear
   trends in T, P, SPI and SPEI were evaluated using non-parametric and
   parametric statistical approaches such as non-modified and modified
   Mann-Kendall Test, Theil-Sen approach, and simple regression. The
   results indicated that the significant trends for temperature are
   approximately all increasing (0.2 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C per
   decade), and for precipitation are mostly decreasing (-7.2 mm to -14.8
   mm per decade). It was also indicated that long-term drought intensities
   monitored by the SPI and SPEI have had significant downward trend
   (drought intensification with time) at most stations of interest. The
   observed trends in the SPI series can be worsen if air temperature (in
   addition to precipitation) participates in drought monitoring as SPEI.
   In arid and extra arid climates, it was observed that temperature has
   strong effects on historical drought characteristics when comparing the
   SPI and SPEI series. Due to the determinative role of temperature in
   mostly dry regions like Iran, the study suggests using the SPEI rather
   than SPI for more effective monitoring of droughts.},

Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {211},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Sea surface temperatures for Tampa Bay, the West Florida Continental
   Shelf (WFS) and the adjacent deep Gulf of Mexico are examined for
   trends. Data sets are from stations maintained by the Hillsborough
   County Environmental Protection Commission, buoys maintained by the
   University of South Florida Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction
   System and the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA)
   National Data Buoy Center, the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface
   Temperature analyses by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental
   Information, and the Hadley Centre Sea Surface Temperature. These
   various data sets, each with different record lengths, require the
   consideration of trends both on the basis of record length and start
   time. Tampa Bay shows a warming trend, but with considerable
   inter-annual variability and start time bias resulting in a lack of
   statistical significance in more recent years. The WFS is also generally
   warming, and its inter-annual variability is largely controlled by the
   upwelling of cooler, deeper Gulf of Mexico water across the shelf break.
   The deep GOM shows statistically significant warming in most of the data
   except for the ``gappy{''} records from buoys, both along the
   continental shelf and in the deep water. Trends in the Gulf of Mexico
   are mostly between 0.1 and 0.5 ?/decade, somewhat larger than the
   secular rise found globally, although within the range of the observed
   decadal variability.},

Abstract = {The long-term midlatitude temperature trend between 85 and 105 km is
   deduced from 25 years (March 1990-December 2014) of Na Lidar
   observations. With a strong warming episode in the 1990s, the time
   series was least-square fitted to an 11-parameter nonlinear function.
   This yields a cooling trend starting from an insignificant value of 0.64
   +/- 0.99 K decade(-1) at 85 km, increasing to a maximum of 2.8 +/- 0.58
   K decade(-1) between 91 and 93 km, and then decreasing to a warming
   trend above 103 km. The geographic altitude dependence of the trend is
   in general agreement with model predictions. To shed light on the nature
   of the warming episode, we show that the recently reported prolonged
   global surface temperature cooling after the Mt Pinatubo eruption can
   also be very well represented by the same response function.},

Abstract = {Understanding the influence of temperature on hand-foot-and-mouth
   disease (HFMD) is an important public health concern as well as being a
   major climate-infection issue in mainland China. City-scale data of
   incidence rates (IRs) of HFMD and temperature from 2008 to 2009 in
   mainland China has been analyzed. There were two peak periods for HFMD
   prevalence from April to July and August to November. Regions with
   higher monthly IR of HFMD periodically shifted following the pattern of
   south-north-south from March to December. Monthly IR of HFMD at city
   scale were closely associated with both average monthly temperature and
   monthly temperature range. Our study shows that spatiotemporal trends of
   HFMD infection were sensitive to temperature variation, and suggest that
   preventive measures should be considered for limiting the epidemic of
   HFMD in the cities with higher monthly IR during the peak periods.},

Title = {Accounting for the effects of volcanoes and ENSO in comparisons of

Year = {2001},
Volume = {106},
Number = {D22},

Abstract = {Several previous studies have attempted to remove the effects of
   explosive volcanic eruptions and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
   variability from time series of globally averaged surface and
   tropospheric temperatures. Such work has largely ignored the nonzero
   correlation between volcanic signals and ENSO. Here we account for this,
   collinearity using an iterative procedure. We remove estimated volcano
   and ENSO signals from the observed global mean temperature data, and
   then calculate trends over 1979-1999 in the residuals. Residual trends
   are sensitive to the choice of index used for removing ENSO effects and
   to uncertainties in key volcanic parameters. Despite these
   sensitivities, residual surface and lower tropospheric (2LT) trends are
   almost always larger than trends in the raw observational data. After
   removal of volcano and ENSO effects, the differential warming between
   the surface and lower troposphere is generally reduced. These results
   suggest that the net effect of volcanoes and ENSO over 1979-1999 was to
   reduce globally averaged surface and tropospheric temperatures and cool
   the troposphere by more than the surface. ENSO and incomplete volcanic
   forcing effects can hamper reliable assessment of the true
   correspondence between modeled and observed trends. In the second part
   of our study, we remove these effects from model data and compare
   simulated and observed residual trends. Residual temperature trends are
   not significantly different at the surface. In the lower troposphere the
   statistical significance of trend differences depends on the experiment
   considered, the choice of ENSO index, and the volcanic signal decay
   time. The simulated difference between surface and tropospheric warming
   rates is significantly smaller than observed in 51 out of 54 cases
   considered. We also examine multiple realizations of model experiments
   with relatively complete estimates of natural and anthropogenic forcing.
   ENSO and volcanic. effects are not removed from these integrations. As
   in the case of residual trends, model and observed raw trends are in
   good agreement at the surface but differ significantly in terms of the
   trend differential between the surface and lower troposphere. Observed
   and simulated lower tropospheric trends are not significantly different
   in 17 out of 24 cases. Our study highlights the large uncertainties
   inherent in removing volcano and ENSO effects from atmospheric
   temperature data. It shows that statistical removal of these effects
   improves the, correspondence between modeled and observed temperature
   trends over the satellite era. Accounting for volcanoes and ENSO cannot
   fully explain the observed warming of the surface relative to the lower
   troposphere, or why this differential warming is not reproduced in the
   model simulations considered here.},

Abstract = {The variability of surface air temperature extremes has been the focus
   of attention during the past several decades, and may exert a great
   influence on the global hydrologic cycle and energy balance through
   thermal forcing. Based on daily minimum (TN) and maximum temperature
   (TX) observed by the China Meteorological Administration at 143
   meteorological stations in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), a suite of
   temperature indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change
   Detection and Indices, with a primary focus on extreme events, were
   computed and analyzed for the period of 1960-2012 for this area. The
   results show widespread significant changes in all temperature indices
   associated with warming in the YRB during 1960-2012. On the whole,
   cold-related indices, i.e., cold nights, cold days, frost days, icing
   days and cold spell duration index significantly decreased by -3.45,
   -1.03, -3.04, -0.42 and -1.6 days/decade, respectively. In contrast,
   warm-related indices such as warm nights, warm days, summer days,
   tropical nights and warm spell duration index significantly increased by
   2.95, 1.71, 2.16, 1.05 and 0.73 days/decade. Minimum TN, maximum TN,
   minimum TX and maximum TX increased significantly by 0.42, 0.18, 0.19
   and 0.14 degrees C/decade. Because of a faster increase in minimum
   temperature than maximum temperature, the diurnal temperature range
   (DTR) exhibited a significant decreasing trend of -0.09 degrees C/decade
   for the whole YRB during 1960-2012. However, the decreasing trends all
   occurred in 1960-1985, while increasing trends though insignificant were
   found in all sub-regions and the whole YRB during 1986-2012.
   Geographically, stations in the eastern Tibet Plateau and northeastern
   YRB showed stronger trends in almost all temperature indices. Time
   series analysis indicated that the YRB was dominated by a general
   cooling trend before the mid-1980s, but a warming trend afterwards. In
   general, the overall warming in the YRB was mainly due to the warming in
   1986-2012. Strong relationships between temperature trends and elevation
   were detected in this study. The warming rates increased with elevation
   when elevation is above 350 m, but decreased with elevation when
   elevation is below 350 m. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   AMERICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {119},

Abstract = {Trends in surface air temperature (SAT) are a common metric for global
   warming. Using observations and observationally driven models, we show
   that a more comprehensive metric for global warming and weather extremes
   is the trend in surface equivalent potential temperature (Thetae\_sfc)
   since it also accounts for the increase in atmospheric humidity and
   latent energy. From 1980 to 2019, while SAT increased by 0.79 degrees C,
   Thetae\_sfc increased by 1.48 degrees C globally and as much as 4
   degrees C in the tropics. The increase in water vapor is responsible for
   the factor of 2 difference between SAT and Thetae\_sfc trends.
   Thetae\_sfc increased more uniformly (than SAT) between the midlatitudes
   of the southern hemisphere and the northern hemisphere, revealing the
   global nature of the heating added by greenhouse gases (GHGs). Trends in
   heat extremes and extreme precipitation are correlated strongly with the
   global/tropical trends in Thetae\_sfc. The tropical amplification of
   Thetae\_sfc is as large as the arctic amplification of SAT, accounting
   for the observed global positive trends in deep convection and a 20\%
   increase in heat extremes. With unchecked GHG emissions, while SAT
   warming can reach 4.8 degrees C by 2100, the global mean Thetae\_sfc can
   increase by as much as 12 degrees C, with corresponding increases of 12
   degrees C (median) to 24 degrees C (5\% of grid points) in land surface
   temperature extremes, a 14- to 30-fold increase in frequency of heat
   extremes, a 40\% increase in the energy available for tropical deep
   convection, and an up to 60\% increase in extreme precipitation.},

Abstract = {Climate change's effect on sea surface temperature (SST) at the regional
   scale vary due to driving forces that include potential changes in ocean
   circulation and internal climate variability, ice cover, thermal
   stability, and ocean mixing layer depth. For a better understanding of
   future effects, it is important to analyze historical changes in SST at
   regional scales and test prediction techniques. In this study, the
   variation in SST across the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (PG\&GO)
   during the past four decades was analyzed and predicted to the end of 21
   st century using a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model. As
   input, daily optimum interpolation SST anomaly (DOISSTA) data, available
   from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United
   States, were used. Descriptive analyses and POD results demonstrated a
   gradually increasing trend in DOISSTA in the PG\&GO over the past four
   decades. The spatial distribution of DOISSTA indicated: (1) that shallow
   parts of the Persian Gulf have experienced minimum and maximum values of
   DOISSTA and (2) high variability in DOISSTA in shallow parts of the
   Persian Gulf, including some parts of southern and northwestern coasts.
   Prediction of future SST using the POD model revealed the highest
   warming during summer in the entire PG\&GO by 2100 and the lowest
   warming during fall and winter in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman,
   respectively. The model indicated that monthly SST in the Persian Gulf
   may increase by up to 4.3 degrees C in August by the turn of the
   century. Similarly, mean annual changes in SST across the PG\&GO may
   increase by about 2.2 degrees C by 2100.},

Abstract = {The sintering process of roller kiln is a critical step in the
   high-temperature solid-state manufacture process for lithium-ion battery
   cathode materials, and the temperature distribution in roller kiln has
   great influence on the performance and consistency of cathode materials.
   The heat transfer mechanism in actual roller kiln is complex, and it is
   difficult to obtain the relationship between the temperature
   distribution and parameters such as the heating power. In this paper,
   the temperature field model of the process is first established and the
   finite volume method is used to simulate the temperature field of the
   roller kiln in the ANSYS software, thereby the change law of saggar
   temperature difference when heating power of upper and lower silicon
   carbon rods are different is studied, as well as the change trend of
   temperature from temperature measurement point varies with saggar
   temperature difference. The results show that the temperature difference
   between the upper and lower saggar layers can be controlled within 5
   degrees C, and the increase in the heating power of the upper silicon
   carbon rod can more easily increase the uniformity of the temperature
   distribution, while the increase in the temperature difference between
   the upper and lower layers of saggars will decrease the temperature at
   the temperature measurement points. Finally, the polynomial function is
   used to fit the relationship between the heating power and the
   temperature of temperature measurement point in the kiln. The research
   of this paper provides a useful reference for improving the process
   parameters in sintering process of roller kiln. (C) 2018, IFAC

Abstract = {In the latest IPCC report (2014) it was estimated that since the
   mid-20th century, the number of cold days and nights has decreased and
   the number of warm days and nights has increased in large parts of
   Europe. Some recent analyses have found that mean summer maximum
   temperature change over Europe was +1.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C during 1880 to
   2005. It seems that human influence has contributed to the observed
   global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature
   extreme. The objective of this work was to identify spatial variations
   of the seasonal and annual extreme temperature variability and trends
   over Romania in the period 1985-2014. Starting with a large
   climatological database (30 years of daily data for 29 locations from
   Romania), daily minimum, maximum and amplitude temperature data were
   condensed into normal probability functions for which the assumption of
   normal distribution was accepted by the Shapiro-Wilk statistical test.
   These functions were then used to calculate the appearance probability
   of annual and monthly temperatures values. Temperatures which appear
   with different probabilities all year long were computed with
   ``NORMDIST{''} function from Microsoft Office Excel. Based on these
   values data thematic maps were generated with isolines drawn by
   geo-statistical interpolation (kriging method of Surfer (R), Golden
   Software, 2012). Comparing the increasing trend per decade expressed by
   probabilities, we found that the minimum temperature had almost the same
   rate (21.6\% in a decade) as the maximum ones (21.0\% in a decade) and
   mean daily temperature amplitude remained unchanged from 1985 to 2014.
   We identified the presence of an increased variability of annual mean
   temperature trends between the different climatological stations. It was
   noted that the level of statistical significance of maximum and minimum
   temperature linear trends per decade was low during winter, spring and
   autumn. But this level of significance was very high for June, July and
   August months. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Using coral data, sea surface temperature (SST) reanalysis data, and
   Climate Model Intercomparison Project III (CMIP3) data, we analyze
   20th-century and future warm pool and cold tongue SST trends. For the
   last 100 years, a broad La Nina-like SST trend, in which the warming
   trend of the warm pool SST is greater than that of the cold tongue SST,
   has appeared in reanalysis SST data sets, 20C scenario experiments of
   the CMIP3 data and less significantly in coral records. However, most
   Coupled General Circulation Models subjected to scenarios of future high
   greenhouse gas concentrations produce larger SST warming trends in cold
   tongues than in warm pools, resembling El Nino-like SST patterns. In
   other words, warmer tropical climate conditions correspond to stronger
   El Nino-like response. Heat budget analyses further verify that warmer
   tropical climates diminish the role of the ocean's dynamic thermostat,
   which currently regulates cold tongue temperatures. Therefore, the
   thermodynamic thermostat, whose efficiency depends on the mean
   temperature, becomes the main regulator (particularly via evaporative
   cooling) of both warm pool and cold tongue temperatures in future warm
   climate conditions. Thus, the warming tendency of the cold tongue SST
   may lead that of the warm pool SST in near future.},

Title = {Trends in Antarctic geopotential height and temperature: A comparison

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Pages = {659-674},
Abstract = {A comparison of 40-yr (1960-99) trends in Antarctic geopotential height
   and temperature from quality controlled radiosonde observations and
   NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (NNR) data is undertaken. Observations from four
   Antarctic stations-having sufficiently long-term and consistent
   datasets-at four pressure levels (850, 500, 300, and 100 hPa) are
   utilized. The NNR reveals substantial negative trends in tropospheric
   geopotential height at high southern latitudes with no significant
   trends seen in the lower stratosphere above Antarctica. In contrast,
   observations indicate only minor negative trends in tropospheric height,
   while statistically significant decreases in height in the lower
   stratosphere have occurred over East Antarctica. However, both NNR and
   observations show a consistent, significant warming (similar
   to1degreesC) in the lower troposphere (>500 hPa) above coastal
   Antarctica. At higher altitudes, trends derived from the two datasets
   diverge; the NNR fails to capture the marked cooling in the lower
   stratosphere associated with seasonal ozone loss. Differences in the
   trends are principally caused by NNR errors prior to the assimilation of
   satellite sounder data, which coincides with significant jumps in NNR
   upper-air temperatures. A rapid drop in NNR tropospheric geopotential
   height across East Antarctica as recently as 1993 is traced to the
   introduction of automatic weather stations in the region. Errors in the
   model height of these surface pressure data cause a significant climate
   jump in the NNR not observed in comparable models. Such spurious jumps
   considerably diminish the usefulness of the NNR for climate change
   studies in Antarctica.},

Title = {The phenology of the spring phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic
   does not trend with temperature},
Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Climate change is anticipated to alter the phenology of phytoplankton
   blooms in the ocean, making their recent dynamics of interest to inform
   models of future ocean states. We characterized temperature change in
   the North Atlantic using metrics that track the patterns of sea surface
   water temperature (SST) defined by quantiles.To complement these thermal
   indicators, we estimated a thermal phenology index in the form of the
   date of the spring transition, taken as the date that temperature
   achieved the long-term mean at a specific location. We then used ocean
   color data (1998-2022) and characterized spring bloom phenology using
   change point methods to derive bloom initiation, duration, magnitude,
   and intensity. The North Atlantic has warmed over recent decades,
   averaging a rate of increase of 0.27 degrees C decade-1, yet throughout
   most of the basin, spring transition timing has remained constant, with
   the exception of small areas with either delayed or advanced
   transitions. There were no clear trends in bloom start or duration in
   the North Atlantic, indicating that spring bloom phenology was
   independent of climate-driven temperature change. Bloom magnitude and
   intensity trended downward in some North Atlantic continental shelf
   seas, indicating that increased temperatures may have had negative
   effects on overall bloom productivity. However, exclusive of the areas
   where the bloom parameters were trending, there was a decrease in
   magnitude and intensity with warmer winter temperatures, suggesting that
   the inter-annual variability of these parameters may be affected by
   thermal conditions at the onset of the bloom. While temperature has
   increased in the North Atlantic, vernal light availability has remained
   unchanged, which may explain why spring bloom phenology has remained
   resistant to climate change. Consequently, it seems plausible that
   future climate change may have limited effects on spring bloom
   phenology, but could have substantial effects on overall phytoplankton
   production.},

Abstract = {Comparisons of surface and tropospheric (850-300 mb) temperature trends
   for climate zones, hemispheres and globe are presented for the period
   1958-1998, based on seasonal and annual-mean temperatures from a

   0.13K/decade during the 41-year period, the 850-300 mb layer by
   0.10+/-0.09K/decade. This small difference in global trend results from
   the surface warming by 0.12K/decade relative to the 850-300 mb layer in
   the northern hemisphere, but the 850-300 mb layer warming by
   0.04K/decade relative to the surface in the southern hemisphere. In
   north polar and temperate zones the warming of the surface relative to
   the 850-300 mb layer is greatest in winter-spring and there is little
   difference in trend in summer. There is a tendency for a similar
   seasonal variation in trend difference in south extratropics, warming of
   the surface relative to the 850-300 mb layer occurring only in winter in
   the south polar zone, and cooling of the surface relative to the 850-300
   mb layer greatest in summer in the south temperate zone. Globally, the
   warming of the surface relative to the 850-300 mb layer is 0.11K/decade

Abstract = {Numerous studies have been performed on Apis florea to examine the
   effect of temperature and vegetation cover on the distribution of the
   species, but less on the trend of changes in Dynamic Habitat Indices
   within the habitats. Land Surface Temperature and Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index as the annual average (2003 to 2021) were analyzed by
   Mann-Kendall test. The differences in the geographical distribution of
   these variables were examined by the periodical average of Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index and Land Surface Temperature (2003-2021)
   using Pettitt test. The True Skill Statistics based on Ensemble species
   distribution was used to identify patches and the Z value of
   Mann-Kendall test to detect the changes of Dynamic Habitat Indices at
   the significance levels of 90, 95, and 99. The conformity of different
   levels of significance with the distribution range was investigated by
   GAP analysis, and on common patches, multi-scale fragmentation analysis
   was performed by the Foreground area density (FAD) method. According to
   the results, Pettitt test found heterogeneity in temperature and
   vegetation in the west-east distribution (P value < 0.001). In the
   upward trend (99\%), habitat patches overlapping with the significant
   trend of vegetation cover a larger area of distribution than habitat
   patches overlapping with the significant trend of temperature.
   Foreground area density indicates the increase in vegetation cover of
   the species habitat has been continuous and is different from the
   temperature trend. For decision making, Dynamic Habitat Indices with
   distribution models are proposed as practical approach to rehabilitate
   lost habitats.},

Title = {Surface Air Temperature Trend Over the Tibetan Plateau in CMIP6 and Its
   Constraint in Future Projection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {128},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV 16},
Abstract = {The surface air temperature (SAT) trend on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) was
   3.45degree celsius 100 years(-1) from 1961 to 2014. The multi-model
   ensemble (MME) of 33 coupled models participated in the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project phase six (CMIP6) was about 1degree celsius 100
   years(-1) lower than the observation. Although MME generally shows
   better skill in reproducing the distribution of SAT trend over TP than
   most of the CMIP6 models, its performance is greatly degraded by a small
   group of models, about 12\% on average, with large biases. In this
   paper, the constrained multi-model ensemble (CMME) based on a certain
   observation-based threshold is used to constrain future projections of
   the SAT trend over TP. Compared with the MME results, the improvements
   in CMME are mainly over the eastern plateau in historical simulation and
   are relative to the reduction of the model biases to carbon dioxide
   (CO2) forcing. Under the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario, SAT increases
   significantly over the entire TP. The constraint of CMME on the MME is
   mainly over the eastern plateau with a difference of 0.5degree celsius
   100 years(-1), about 6\% of the MME results. Under the
   intermediate-emission scenario SSP2-4.5, the effect of CMME is
   relatively smaller, but the corresponding spatial distribution is
   similar to that under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The CMIP6 models tend to
   underestimate the warming trend projections over the water source
   regions in the northeastern plateau and should be noticed.},

Title = {Divergent trends of changes in annual mean and summer temperature in
   southwestern China during the Holocene},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {228},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Reconstructing Holocene temperature changes in the continental setting
   is crucial for better assessing the position of recent global warming
   within the context of long-term natural climate variability and
   understanding the relationship between temperature changs and monsoon
   system. However, the pattern and rate of Holocene temperature variations
   still remain enigmatic due to lack of land-based proxy reconstructions
   with an unambiguous climatic significance. Here we present a well-dated,
   high-resolution, quantitative temperature record based on brGDGT proxy
   during the past 8000 years from the Chenghai Lake in southwestern China.
   A systematic modern investigation reveals a close correlation between
   the reconstructed and instrumental mean annual air temperature (MAAT)
   during the past 60 years, suggesting that sedimentary brGDGT proxy can
   capture the variations of MAAT during the geological past with a high
   fidelity. Within an improved chronological framework, our reconstructed
   Holocene MAAT record displays a long-term warming trend with a magnitude
   of similar to 1.5 degrees C. This overall warming pattern is consistent
   with the variations of existing regional MAAT records, but in
   contradiction to the summer temperature records which is similar to the
   variation of the Asian summer monsoon. In light of state-of-the-art
   transient climate simulations, we demonstrate that changes in Holocene
   MAAT were forced by local annual-mean insolation with an additional
   radiative forcing of greenhouse gases, while changes in summer
   temperature were mainly controlled by local summer insolation, thereby
   resulting in a divergent pattern of seasonal temperature changes in
   southwestern China. Our study provides new evidence for reconciling the
   ``Holocene temperature conundrum{''} between proxy reconstruction and
   model simulations from low latitudes.},

Abstract = {Sensorless temperature estimation methods for batteries can be
   classified into three categories: analytical methods, observer-based
   methods and data-driven methods. In general, analytical methods are easy
   to derive and implement but have a limited performance due to their
   open-loop nature. Observer-based methods have a high performance due to
   their closed-loop nature but demand accurate dynamic and measurement
   models with up-to-date parameters for accurate estimation. Data-driven
   methods are extremely stable and robust due to their massive parallel
   structure, but they demand huge amount of data for training. This paper
   presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art sensorless
   temperature estimation methods for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries and
   demonstrates the advantages and limitations of each. A comparison
   between the presented methods in terms of their performance and
   implementation requirements is carried out. In addition, practical
   considerations, challenges and future trends are discussed.},

Abstract = {An attempt has been made, in this paper, to understand the
   characteristics and trends of temperatures of Kolkata, India, by using
   the temperature extremes, as recommended by Expert Team on Climate
   Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), and other relevant indices. For
   the purpose, daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures (1969-2012)
   of Alipore and Dum Dum observatories have been used. Both parametric
   (linear regression test) and non-parametric (Mann-Kendall test) have
   been done to detect the change, and Sen's slope estimator has been used
   to establish the degree of change. To detect homogeneity of the dataset,
   four homogeneous tests have been applied. Long-term (1969-2012) trends
   of extreme temperature indices like TXa, TXn, TMa, TNx, TNa, and TNn of
   monthly, seasonal, and annual time steps significantly detect a
   positively increasing trend. The rate is found to be the maximum at Dum
   Dum. Long-term trends of TXa, TNx, TNa, TNn, and TMa indicate an average
   positive temperature change of 0.30 degrees C/decade to 0.62 degrees
   C/decade, and in extreme cases over 0.65 degrees C/decade. Results also
   point out that in the monsoon and the post-monsoon seasons most of the
   trends are noticeable. In most of the cases, rates of positive
   temperature trends have been lower in recent time period (series II,
   1985-2012), compared to the past time period (series I, 1969-1995).
   Distribution of the relative temperature indices also points out
   presence of asymmetric distribution between warm nights and cold days,
   and cold nights. Around three times more positive increase of warm
   nights has been noticed at Dum Dum station during 1971-1980 and
   2001-2010.},

Abstract = {Recent climate change has been caused by interaction of natural
   processes and the anthropogenic factor. In turn, it incites the
   pronounced natural and socioeconomic changes. It is the air temperature
   that plays a pertinent role in understanding the climate change problem.
   Southeast Europe, including Bosnia and Herzegovina (B\&H), is highly
   relevant for the observations of regional differences in changes of air
   temperature regime. From the regional-geographical point of view, South
   and Southeast B\&H cover 26.5\% (13.568 km(2)) of B\&H territory (51.209
   km(2)). It is from south and southeast that the Mediterranean impacts
   from the Adriatic Sea penetrate into the defined region, which further
   affects the Variability of climate conditions in B\&H. The paper
   presents trends in three parameter categories: mean annual, mean
   maximum, and mean minimum air temperatures in the territory of South and
   Southeast B\&H. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the likely
   climate change based on air temperature trends. Methodologically,
   temperature trends were processed by using the Mann-Kendall trend test.
   For the purpose of the analysis, available data from four meteorological
   stations in South and Southeast B\&H for a 56-year period were used.
   Based on the obtained results, a statistically relevant positive trend
   was observed in all twelve time series. According to the analyzed
   trends, the increase of air temperature was dominant in the target area.
   The application of Geographical Information System (GIS) tools indicated
   the presence of regional differences in air temperature distribution. An
   evident phenomenon is the combined impact of the orography of the region
   and the maritime influence. The occurring climate change affects
   specific social sectors, so the problem must be addressed properly.
   Another pertinent fact is that the climate change problem has not been
   adequately analyzed in the strategic documents in B\&H.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between altitude and summer
   temperature trends in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains. We considered
   20 weather stations and three types of topography: summit, slope and
   depression. We used a change-point regression model with serially
   correlated errors and compared it with a mainstream literature
   change-point model with independent errors. For both models, we
   identified decreasing trends before the change-point and increasing
   trends afterwards for most summer temperature series. The model with
   serially correlated errors gives change-points and trends that are more
   variable for lower altitude and more similar with each other at higher
   altitudes. One of the possible factors explaining this behavior is that
   temperatures from some weather stations in depression areas may be
   influenced by human settlings and industrial activities, and this
   influence would dissipate with altitude. On the other hand, the model
   with independent errors shows no pattern in the variability of change
   points or trends. The cluster analysis also reveals that weather
   stations are best grouped by altitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-30},
Abstract = {Secular trends and multi-timescale oscillations of global and regional
   surface air temperature (SAT) have been widely investigated in recent
   decades. In this paper, the method of ensemble empirical mode
   decomposition (EEMD) is first used to decompose 18 station SAT anomalies
   in eastern China from 1921 to 2011; 16 stations are then grouped into 4
   regions based on the secular non-linear trend and multi-timescale
   oscillations longer than 10 yr in these SAT anomaly series. The analysis
   showed that multi-timescale oscillations commonly exist in eastern
   China, while the 2 largest regional warming trends of 3.3 and 1.21
   degrees C per century exist in Northeast China and North China,
   respectively. Four regional secular non-linear trends and
   multi-timescale oscillations were explained and used in the
   extrapolation for the coming 2 decades. Although there is a secular
   warming trend, the predicted SAT anomaly for Northeast China is expected
   to continue the recent warming slowdown in this decade and then a new
   warm flat in the following decade. For other regional SAT anomaly
   predictions, North China will have a slight warming trend in the coming
   2 decades, central China will have a warming process in this decade then
   a new warm spell in the 2020s, and South China will maintain the current
   level in this decade then have a quick warming process in the 2020s.},

Abstract = {Surface air temperature (SAT) from four reanalysis/analysis datasets are
   analyzed and compared with the observed SAT from 11 stations in the
   Antarctic. It is found that the SAT variation from Goddard Institute for
   Space Studies (GISS) is the best to represent the observed SAT. Then we
   use the sea ice concentration (SIC) data from satellite measurements,
   the SAT data from the GISS dataset and station observations to examine
   the trends and variations of sea ice and SAT in the Antarctic during
   1979-2009. The Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE) shows an increased trend
   during 1979-2009, with a trend rate of 1.36 +/- A 0.43\% per decade.
   Ensemble empirical mode decomposition analysis shows that the rate of
   the increased trend has been accelerating in the past decade. Antarctic
   SIE trend depends on the season, with the maximum increase occurring in
   autumn. If the relationship between SIC and GISS SAT trends is examined
   regionally, Antarctic SIC trends agree well with the local SAT trends in
   the most Antarctic regions. That is, Antarctic SIC and SAT show an
   inverse relationship: a cooling (warming) SAT trend is associated with
   an upward (downward) SIC trend. It is also concluded that the
   relationship between sea ice and SAT trends in the Antarctic should be
   examined regionally rather than integrally.},

Title = {Trends in the temperature and water vapor content of the tropical lower

Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},

Abstract = {The tropical lower stratosphere is an important region of the
   atmosphere, where strong convective activity in the underlying
   troposphere affects both its chemical and dynamical properties.
   Temperatures near the tropopause influence the input of water vapor from
   the troposphere and act as an indicator of the dynamical properties of
   the region. This paper addresses long-term trends in the temperature of
   the tropical lower stratosphere. Correlations with recent changes in
   tropical stratospheric water vapor are also noted. Special attention is
   given to the convectively active tropical western Pacific Ocean, where
   sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are among the highest in the world. The
   region contains several island radiosonde stations with records reliably
   extending over several decades. Results show only weak cooling trends
   occurred before the 1990s, but a strong and rapid cooling of 4 degrees
   to 6 degrees C took place in the mid-1990s and has persisted since that
   time. The properties of the temperature records during and following
   this cooling event are discussed, and a significant anticorrelation with
   SST anomalies in the underlying ocean is noted. The rate of ocean
   warming increased in the early 1990s, coinciding approximately with the
   mid-decade cooling event, while individual monthly anomalies in both
   time series are also anticorrelated. Past work has shown that cooling of
   the tropical lower stratosphere is a dynamical result of tropospheric
   convection, which in turn partially depends upon sea surface
   temperatures. Convection may therefore be the link between the ocean and
   the stratosphere, and the increased cooling may be an indication of
   strengthening tropical convection.},

Abstract = {The warming of the near-surface air in the Arctic region has been larger
   than the global mean surface warming. There is general agreement that
   the Arctic amplification of the surface air temperature (SAT) trend to a
   considerable extent is due to local effects such as the retreat of sea
   ice, especially during the summer months, and earlier melting of snow in
   the spring season. There is no doubt that these processes are important
   causes of the Arctic SAT trend. It is less clear, however, whether the
   trend may also be related to recent changes in the atmospheric
   midlatitude circulation. This question is the focus of the present
   paper.
   Model experiments have shown that in a warmer climate responding to, for
   example, a doubling of CO2, the atmospheric northward energy transport
   (ANET) will increase and cause polar SAT amplification. In the present
   study, the development of the ANET across 60 degrees N and its linkage
   to the Arctic SAT have been explored using the ERA-40 reanalysis data
   from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It
   is found that during 1979-2001, the ANET has experienced an overall
   positive but weak trend, which was largest during the period from the
   mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. In addition, it is found that the Arctic SAT
   is sensitive to variability of the ANET across 60 degrees N and hence to
   variability of the midlatitude circulation: A large ANET is followed by
   warming of the Arctic where ANET leads by about 5 days. The warming is
   located primarily north of the Atlantic and Pacific sectors, indicating
   that baroclinic weather systems developing around the Icelandic and
   Aleutian lows are important for the energy transport. Furthermore, it is
   suggested here that a small, but statistically significant, part of the
   mean Arctic SAT trend is linked to the trend in the ANET.
   Another important indicator of the midlatitude circulation is the Arctic
   Oscillation (AO). Through the 1980s and early 1990s the AO index has
   shown a positive trend. However, even though a part of the SAT trend can
   be related to the AO in localized parts of the Arctic area, the mean
   Arctic SAT trend shows no significant linkage to the AO.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Spencer and Christy have analyzed data derived from the Microwave
   Sounding Unit (MSU) series of satellite instruments to assess climate
   change. This report presents data which suggests a source of error in
   their MSU/AMSU TLT product. A comparison of data for high latitudes in
   the Southern Hemisphere demonstrate that the TLT product does not
   represent the seasonal cycle of temperature in the lower troposphere, as
   seen in radiosonde data from Antarctica. The difference appears to be
   the result of the yearly sea-ice cycle, thus trends in the sea-ice cycle
   may impact the TLT product. The Arctic data could also be influenced.
   These observations question of the validity of the TLT product as a
   measure of climate change at high latitudes.},

Title = {Trend of soil temperature during pipeline leakage of high-pressure
   natural gas: Experimental and numerical study},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {153},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The key to buried gas pipeline leakage detection using a distributed
   optical fiber is to detect temperature changes. However, the trend of
   temperature change caused by natural gas leakage lacks tests and
   verification. Optical cable laying on site is not standard. In this
   work, combined with the Peng-Robinson (PR) real gas state equation and
   fiber Raman scattering principle, the trend of soil temperature around a
   leakage hole was systematically studied. The simulation results show
   that the higher the pressure of pipeline, leakage hole and soil
   porosity, the faster the rate of temperature change is monitored, the
   greater the temperature change at leakage hole. Temperature change can
   be clearly detected within 100 mm from the leak hole. On this basis, a
   field test was conducted for a buried high-pressure gas pipeline
   leakage. The test used the array of point temperature sensor and fiber
   to collect the change of soil temperature. The test results show that
   the soil temperature field at the leakage hole changed the most. The
   temperature change was detected within 100 mm away from the leakage
   hole. The test and simulation results are basically consistent. (C) 2019

Title = {Simulating Arctic 2-m air temperature and its linear trends using the
   HIRHAM5 regional climate model},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {217},
Pages = {137-149},

Abstract = {Air temperature at 2-m (T2) in the Arctic represents its local climate.
   Its quantification is one of the major criteria to evaluate the
   performance of numerical models in reflecting the complex physical and
   dynamical processes associated with the surface energy balance. This
   study uses HIRHAM5 regional climate model to simulate the Arctic climate
   during 1979-2014. Evaluations with Arctic station observations reveal
   that HIRHAM5 can generally reproduce the temporal and spatial variation
   of the T2, although a systematic cold bias of ca. -2 degrees C exists in
   all seasons. The overestimated surface albedo in spring and autumn, and
   the underestimated downward solar radiation associated with the cloud
   cover in summer are the main causes of the cold biases in each
   respective season. The model also simulates the Arctic warming well
   (with linear trends of 0.40 degrees C decade(-1) for the annual mean
   T2), although the magnitude is less than that from ERA-Interim (0.55
   degrees C decade(-1)) and station observations (0.60 degrees C
   decade(-1)). In addition, strong decadal variability is clear in the T2
   trends calculated using an 11-year moving windows, especially in winter
   and spring, which is mainly associated with the variability of the
   Arctic/North Atlantic Oscillations.},

Title = {Possible Impact of Spatial and Temporal Non-Uniformity in Land Surface
   Temperature Data on Trend Estimation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {819-828},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The present work investigates possible impact of the non-uniformity in
   observed land surface temperature on trend estimation, based on Climatic
   Research Unit (CRU) Temperature Version 4 (CRUTEM4) monthly temperature
   datasets from 1900 to 2012. The CRU land temperature data exhibit
   remarkable non-uniformity in spatial and temporal features. The data are
   characterized by an uneven spatial distribution of missing records and
   station density, and display a significant increase of available sites
   around 1950. Considering the impact of missing data, the trends seem to
   be more stable and reliable when estimated based on data with < 40\%
   missing percent, compared to the data with above 40\% missing percent.
   Mean absolute error (MAE) between data with < 40\% missing percent and
   global data is only 0.011 degrees C (0.014 degrees C) for 1900-50
   (1951-2012). The associated trend estimated by reliable data is 0.087
   degrees C decade(-1) (0.186 degrees C decade(-1)) for 1900-50
   (1951-2012), almost the same as the trend of the global data. However,
   due to non-uniform spatial distribution of missing data, the global
   signal seems mainly coming from the regions with good data coverage,
   especially for the period 1900-50. This is also confirmed by an extreme
   test conducted with the records in the United States and Africa. In
   addition, the influences of spatial and temporal non-uniform features in
   observation data on trend estimation are significant for the areas with
   poor data coverage, such as Africa, while insignificant for the
   countries with good data coverage, such as the United States.},

Abstract = {The energy conservation provides a bridge between demand and supply gap
   of power with minimum capital investment. It avoids wasteful use of
   energy which can be readily used without any further loss. Induction
   heating systems do not burn traditional fossil fuels so induction
   heating is a clean, non-polluting and safe process which helps to meet
   power requirement. Induction cooking is an application of induction
   heating which is used for residential and commercial usage. This paper
   presents temperature control of induction cooker using class E resonant
   inverter. With the help of class E resonant inverter, high power factor
   and low line current can be obtained which are very attractive in terms
   of commercial production. Pulse density modulation (PDM) is used for
   controlling temperature. The circuit is build using peripheral interface
   controller (PIC) microcontroller and temperature sensor. Simulation of
   induction cooker circuit using class E resonant inverter in MATLAB is
   used for checking dynamic response. The induction cooker's parameters
   using class E resonant inverter are designed properly and details of
   design are described. Both hardware and simulation results are compared.},
