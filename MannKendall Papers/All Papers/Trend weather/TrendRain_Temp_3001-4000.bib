Title = {Analysis of Temperature Variability, Trends and Prediction in the
   Karachi Region of Pakistan Using ARIMA Models},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper, the average monthly temperature of the Karachi region,
   Pakistan, has been modelled. The time period of the procured dataset is
   from January 1989 to December 2018. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving
   Average (ARIMA) modelling technique in conjunction with the Box-Jenkins
   approach has been applied to forecast the average monthly temperature of
   the study area. A total of 83.33\% of the trained dataset is used for
   construction of the model, and the remaining 16.67\% of the dataset is
   used for the validation of the model. The best-fitted model is
   identified as ARIMA (2, 1, 4), generated on the basis of minimum values
   of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information
   Criterion (BIC) procedures. The accuracy parameters considered are Root
   Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Both parameters
   show that the model is 98.152\% and 98.413\% accurate, respectively. In
   addition, the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity-Lagrange
   Multiplier (ARCH-LM) test has been conducted to check the presence of
   heteroscedasticity in the residuals of the identified model. This test
   shows no heteroscedasticity present in the residual series. By means of
   Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function
   (PACF) plots, the most appropriate orders of the ARIMA model are
   determined and evaluated. The model has been employed to investigate the
   time series variables' precise impact on the scale of the regional
   warming scenario. Accordingly, the created model can help in determining
   future strategies related to weather conditions in the Karachi region.
   From the forecast result, it is found that the average temperature seems
   to show an increasing trend. Such an increasing trend can potentially
   upset the weather conditions and economic activities of the coastal area
   of Pakistan.},

Title = {Sign of Observed California Temperature Trends Depends on Data Set
   Homogenization: Implications for Weighting and Downscaling},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Because downscaling methods can yield substantially different
   projections of future climate, it is imperative to constrain these
   projections with information from existing observations, while also
   recognizing observational uncertainty. California is a natural test case
   to develop observational constraints on future projections given prior
   studies that have purportedly found contrasting spatial patterns in
   late-20th-century trends of summertime daily-maximum temperature:
   cooling along the coast and warming inland. Revisiting this claim, we
   find that coastal cooling is largely confined to non-homogenized
   temperature records while homogenized observations show either
   non-significant cooling or warming trends throughout the state. This
   finding has implications for weighting historical and future climate
   simulations downscaled using localized constructed analogs. Failure to
   consider out-of-sample skill results in weighted and unweighted
   Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 temperature trend estimates
   differing by 2 K/century or more in California. However, weighted mean
   estimates that properly account for trend uncertainty do not differ
   significantly from the unweighted mean.},

Title = {Re-evaluating the role of solar variability on Northern Hemisphere
   temperature trends since the 19th century},
Journal = {EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {150},
Pages = {409-452},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Debate over what influence (if any) solar variability has had on surface
   air temperature trends since the 19th century has been controversial. In
   this paper, we consider two factors which may have contributed to this
   controversy:
   1. Several different solar variability datasets exist While each of
   these datasets is constructed on plausible grounds, they often imply
   contradictory estimates for the trends in solar activity since the 19th
   century.
   2. Although attempts have been made to account for non-climatic biases
   in previous estimates of surface air temperature trends, recent research
   by two of the authors has shown that current estimates are likely still
   affected by non-climatic biases, particularly urbanization bias. With
   these points in mind, we first review the debate over solar variability.
   We summarise the points of general agreement between most groups and the
   aspects which still remain controversial. We discuss possible future
   research which may help resolve the controversy of these aspects. Then,
   in order to account for the problem of urbanization bias, we compile a
   new estimate of Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends since
   1881, using records from predominantly rural stations in the monthly
   Global Historical Climatology Network dataset Like previous weather
   station-based estimates, our new estimate suggests that surface air
   temperatures warmed during the 1880s-1940s and 1980s-2000s. However,
   this new estimate suggests these two warming periods were separated by a
   pronounced cooling period during the 1950s-1970s and that the relative
   warmth of the mid-20th century warm period was comparable to the recent
   warm period.
   We then compare our weather station-based temperature trend estimate to
   several other independent estimates. This new record is found to be
   consistent with estimates of Northern Hemisphere Sea Surface Temperature
   (SST) trends, as well as temperature-proxy-based estimates derived from
   glacier length records and from tree ring widths. However, the
   multi-model means of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model hindcasts were unable to adequately
   reproduce the new estimate although the modelling of certain volcanic
   eruptions did seem to be reasonably well reproduced.
   Finally, we compare our new composite to one of the solar variability
   datasets not considered by the CMIP5 climate models, i.e., Scafetta and
   Willson, 2014's update to the Hoyt and Schatten, 1993 dataset A strong
   correlation is found between these two datasets, implying that solar
   variability has been the dominant influence on Northern Hemisphere
   temperature trends since at least 1881. We discuss the significance of
   this apparent correlation, and its implications for previous studies
   which have instead suggested that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide
   has been the dominant influence. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Implications of changes in the atmospheric circulation on the detection
   of regional surface air temperature trends},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that observed significant warming trends in
   surface air temperature ( SAT) consistent with the response to
   anthropogenic forcing are detected at scales on the order of 500 km in
   many regions of the globe. However, regional SAT trends project strongly
   on the dominant natural atmospheric circulation modes, such as the
   Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the hemispheric Pacific-North America
   (PNA)-like patterns. The warming associated with the changes of
   atmospheric circulation is not well simulated in current coupled climate
   models. In this study, we explore the influence of the exclusion of
   warming related to changes of the atmospheric circulation on the
   detection of a regional response to combined anthropogenic and natural
   forcings. We compare observed SAT trends over the second half of the
   20th century with those simulated in response to natural and
   anthropogenic climate forcings in a suite of six current coupled general
   circulation models. Control runs from these models are used to provide
   estimates of the internal variability of trends. We find that the
   detection of the regional response to combined anthropogenic and natural
   forcing is robust to the exclusion of warming related to changes of the
   atmospheric circulation considered here.},

Abstract = {A Fourier-type regression equation is used to model monthly values and
   long-term temporal trends of sea surface temperature (SST) in 88 areas
   of the South Atlantic and South Indian oceans surrounding subequatorial
   Africa, based on more than two million measurements of SST over a period
   of 81 years (1910-1990). In most of the 81 areas north of 40 degrees S,
   the model accounts for a large portion of the observed variance in SST
   records and predicts well-defined seasonal trends in SST In the more
   southerly areas (between 20 degrees and 40 degrees S), the peak in SST
   occurs in February, closer to the Equator it occurs in March, and in
   some areas near the Equator influenced by the South Equatorial Current
   in April. In most of the Indian Ocean considered, around the African
   coast and immediately south of the Equator in the Atlantic Ocean, the
   minimum SST is in August. Elsewhere in that portion of the Atlantic
   Ocean investigated it is in September High seasonal amplitudes in SST
   occur near the African coast in regions influenced by the Angola and
   Agulhas currents and in the central South Atlantic where isotherms
   migrate meridionally. Coherence in SST residuals between modelled
   results and observed data indicates that several large regions of the
   ocean are influenced similarly These regions generally, conform with
   known oceanographic features. The coastal regions off western South
   Africa show affinities with several ocean areas and because of the
   influence of several oceanographic regimes are likely to be highly
   variable. The model suggests an average warming of 0.46 degrees C in the
   region between 1910 and 1990.},

   of surface air temperature lapse rate},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {307},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The intensity and direction of elevation -dependent warming (EDW) could
   vary in different parts of the mountain, while less attention is paid to
   the local EDW effect. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the T `ai-hang \&
   Lvliang Mountains in Shanxi Province of China (TLMsx) were taken as
   cases to examine the relationship between EDW and the long-term trend of
   surface air temperature (SAT) lapse rate (SATLR). For the observed data,
   the intensity of regional EDW ( I EDW ) was estimated with linear
   regression model, while the SATLR was estimated with geographically
   weighted regression (GWR) model. The long-term trend of SATLR was
   estimated applying the modified Theil-Sen method, and the regional
   average SATLR trend ( k SATLR ) was calculated and analyzed. Both
   observed data and simulation experiment revealed that there was not
   significant difference between I EDW andk SATLR , with a little
   difference caused by the noise in the SAT trends. As the SATLR trend
   measured the difference in the surface air warming rate within 1 -km
   vertical distance, i.e. the intensity of EDW in a small spatial scale,
   in the context of climate warming, it could be used to estimate the
   intensity of local EDW. The SATLR trend thus provided a new perspective
   to study the EDW effect in the future, and facilitated the quantitative
   analysis on the mechanisms of EDW.},

Abstract = {In the western United States, a temperature sensor change at the snow
   telemetry stations is responsible for erroneously greater temperature
   warming trends in high-elevation mountain areas than lower elevation
   locations. This study examined how the temperature sensor changes
   influenced these trends across Colorado and evaluated two homogenization
   methods that adjust these data biases. Perspectives differ on whether
   the presensor (before the changing of the temperature sensors) or
   post-sensor (after) change data are correct, so temperature records from
   both the pre- and post-sensor change period (similar to 1990s to
   mid-2000s) were individually adjusted at 68 longer-term stations. Trends
   were analyzed with and without the adjustments using the Mann-Kendall
   significance test and Theil-Sen's rate of change. Initially the
   post-sensor change data were used to calibrate a temperature index snow
   water equivalent model that was evaluated with the original and adjusted
   temperature data sets. Mean temperature warming trends for the original
   data set averaged 0.95 degrees per decade and reduced to less than 0.5
   degrees per decade for the adjusted data sets. Results from the
   temperature index model showed that snow water equivalent was simulated
   better with the homogenized temperatures from both methods relative to
   the original temperatures, with 44-69\% of the stations within
   ``good{''} and ``very good{''} performance categories. This modeling was
   repeated using calibration of the presensor change data yielding very
   similar results. These findings show that accurate reconstruction of the
   historical temperature records is challenging but temperature adjustment
   methods can create more reliable temperature records for climate change
   analysis and hydroclimatic modeling.},

Title = {Diagnosis of radiosonde vertical temperature trend profiles: Comparing
   the influence of data homogenization versus model forcings},

Abstract = {Measurements from radiosonde temperatures have been used in studies that
   seek to identify the human influence on climate. However, such
   measurements are known to be contaminated by artificial inhomogeneities
   introduced by changes in instruments and recording practices that have
   occurred over time. Some simple diagnostics are used to compare vertical
   profiles of temperature trends from the observed data with simulations
   from a GCM driven by several different sets of forcings. Unlike most
   earlier studies of this type, both raw (i.e., fully contaminated) as
   well as adjusted observations (i.e., treated to remove some of the
   contamination) are utilized. The comparisons demonstrate that the effect
   of observational data adjustment can be as important as the inclusion of
   some major climate forcings in the model simulations. The effects of
   major volcanic eruptions critically influence temperature trends, even
   over a time period nearly four decades in length.
   In addition, it is seen that the adjusted data show consistently better
   agreement than the unadjusted data, with simulations from a climate
   model for 1959-97. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the
   adjustments supply missing warming in the tropical upper troposphere
   that has been attributed to model error in a number of earlier studies.
   Finally, an evaluation of the fidelity of the model's temperature
   response to major volcanic eruptions is conducted. Although the major
   conclusions of this study are unaffected by shortcomings of the
   simulations, they highlight the fact that even using a fairly long
   period of record (similar to 40 yr), any such shortcomings can have an
   important impact on trends and trend comparisons.},

Abstract = {Physical and climatic variables such as Tree Canopy coverage, Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Distance to Roads, Distance to the
   Coast, Impervious Surface, and Precipitation can affect land surface
   temperature (LST). This paper examines the relationships using linear
   regression models and explores LST trends in the Miami Statistical Area
   (MSA) between 2002 and 2021. This study evaluates the effect of dry and
   wet seasons as well as day and night data on LST. A multiscale
   investigation is used to examine LST trends at the MSA scale, the
   individual county level, and at the pixel level to provide a detailed
   local perspective. The multiscale results are needed to understand
   spatiotemporal LST distributions to plan mitigation measures such as
   planting trees or greenery to regulate temperature and reduce the
   impacts of surface urban heat islands. The results indicate that LST
   values are rising in the MSA with a positive trend throughout the
   20-year study period. The rate of change (RoC) for the wet season is
   smaller than for the dry season. The pixel-level analysis suggests that
   the RoC is primarily in rural areas and less apparent in urban areas.
   New development in rural areas may trigger increased RoC. This RoC
   relates to LST in the MSA and is different from global or regional RoC
   using air temperature. Results also suggest that climatic explanatory
   variables have different impacts during the night than they do in the
   daytime. For instance, the Tree Canopy variable has a positive
   coefficient, while during the day, the Tree Canopy variable has a
   negative relationship with LST. The Distance to the Coast variable
   changes from day to night as well. The increased granularity achieved
   with the multiscale analysis provides critical information needed to
   improve the effectiveness of potential mitigation efforts.},

Abstract = {Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) monitoring is significant as it
   provides valuable information on climate changes and resultant changes
   in lakes. Here, monthly moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
   LSWT data of 364 lakes during 2001-2015 were analysed to determine
   spatiotemporal patterns of daytime (LSWTd), nighttime (LSWTn), daily
   LSWT (LSWTm) and their drivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at monthly,
   seasonal and annual timescales. We focused on spatiotemporal
   heterogeneity of LSWT trends. Results showed climatological LSWT
   presented a saddle-shaped distribution along the northeast-southwest
   direction except for LSWTd in March, while highly heterogeneous LSWT
   trends without spatial dependence were observed at all timescales.
   Diurnal asymmetry of LSWT trends was evident with 56.04-88.19\% lakes
   showing smaller LSWTd trends than LSWTn trends except for August and
   September. Further, we found lake surface albedo trend could effectively
   explain spatial patterns of LSWT trends at different timescales, and its
   interactions with other variable trends generally were the largest or
   second-largest.},

   the basis of data of radiosonde observations at 10 aerological stations
   in the Siberian region for the period from 1981 to 2020. Positive
   temperature trends are observed in the ABL at all the stations in
   January and July, except for the midlatitude zone (50-60 degrees N) of
   Western Siberia, where negative trends are noted in January. The values
   of the trends in temperature anomalies for the periods (1981-2010) and
   (1981-2020) are also compared. The comparison shows that warming has
   increased in polar latitudes in Western Siberia over the past 40 years,
   both in January and July, and the cooling is weakening in the subpolar
   and midlatitude zones in January. In Eastern Siberia, on the contrary,
   the warming has slowed down throughout the ABL in polar latitudes and
   increased in midlatitudes, especially near the Earth's surface, in
   January as compared to the period (1981-2010); the cooling has
   intensified in subpolar latitudes. In July, a decrease in warming is

Abstract = {Air temperature and vapor pressure are both considered important factors
   affecting thermal comfort during summer. However, their variability
   contributes differently to the comfort level. Based on daily
   observations over a 56-year period (1961-2016), this study used the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Theil-Sen's estimator to examine the trends
   in summer air temperature and vapor pressure for 648 stations across
   China. Geographic information system (GIS) grouping analysis was applied
   to understand the spatial pattern of their changes. Further, based on
   the assumption of constant wind speed and mean radiant temperature equal
   to air temperature, the responses of summer daily mean Universal Thermal
   Comfort Index (UTCI) and the number of summer days with ``no thermal
   stress{''} to changes in summer air temperature and vapor pressure were
   investigated. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the areas
   where UTCI is more sensitive to air temperature and vapor pressure
   changes. Comparison of the contributions of air temperature and vapor
   pressure was made to understand the different roles they have played in
   the changes of UTCI. The results show that approximately 70\% of the
   stations show significant increases in summer air temperature and 33\%
   of the stations show upward trends in summer vapor pressure. As a
   consequence of the increasing UTCI throughout most of the country, the
   number of ``no thermal stress{''} days dropped sharply in many areas
   with an exception of the Tibetan Plateau where this number rose by an
   average of 0.05 days per year during the study period. Sensitivity
   analysis shows that summer UTCI is much more sensitive to a unit change
   of air temperature than that of vapor pressure. However, due to its
   substantial changes in some regions, including Northwest and Northeast
   China, the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, vapor pressure
   also played an important role in either intensifying or mitigating the
   thermal stress in summer.},

Abstract = {Whether large trends exist in pre-industrial control (PICTL) runs is
   critically important for evaluating simulations of present climate
   change. This study examined the long-term trends in PICTL surface air
   temperature (SAT) in CMIP5 models. Small trends (<0.06 degrees C/100
   year) in the globally averaged SAT (GASAT) exist in most CMIP5 models.
   Of these, positive (negative) trends result from positive (negative) net
   radiation fluxes at the TOA. This conclusion was further confirmed by
   the significant positive correlations between the TOA and the SAT
   tendency. The PICTL GASAT trends constitute less than 10\% of the
   historical trends, indicating that such trends are of negligible
   importance in estimates of historical global warming in most models.
   Spatially, relative to the historical trends, the PICTL trends comprise
   a nontrivial fraction (>20\%) in the Southern Ocean between 50 degrees S
   and 65 degrees S and in the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans north
   of 40 degrees N, with large inter-model spread. The long-term behavior
   of SAT is significantly related to ocean circulation adjustment in the
   mid-high latitudes.},

Abstract = {Many problems in current climate research deal with extreme events.
   Since by definition there are few observations of really extreme events,
   it is a statistical challenge to assess whether observed trends are
   significant. In this paper we illustrate one method to look for climate

Abstract = {From 1961-2004, surface water temperature in large and shallow Lakes
   Peipsi and Vortsjarv in Estonia increased significantly in April and
   August; respectively 0.37-0.75 and 0.32-0.42 degrees per decade
   reflecting the changes in air temperature. The average annual amount of
   precipitation in the catchment increased significantly. Reflecting
   practices in agriculture and wastewater treatment, nutrient loadings to
   the lakes increased rapidly in the 1980s and decreased again in the
   early 1990s. As total nitrogen (TN) loading decreased faster than total
   phosphorus (TP) loading, the TN/TP ratio in the loadings decreased. Both
   the increased temperature and low TN/TP ratio favoured the development
   of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Peipsi. In Vortsjarv, where the TN/TP
   mass ratio is about two times higher than in Peipsi, blooms did not
   occur. Recently, the TN/TP ratio has shown a tendency of increase in
   both lakes suggesting a certain reduction of blooms to be expected also
   in Lake Peipsi. Nutrient dynamics in the lakes followed the changes in
   loadings, showing the ability of shallow lake ecosystems to react
   sensitively to changes in catchment management as well as in climate.},

Abstract = {Differential absorption lidar (DIAL) at the National Institute for
   Environmental Studies (NIES) in Tsukuba (36 degrees N, 140 degrees E),
   Japan has been making routine observations for almost 20 years. Since
   1988, more than 600 vertical profiles of stratospheric ozone and
   temperature have been obtained. We compared the lidar data with
   satellite data from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE
   II) and assimilation data from the National Center for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP). The lidar and SAGE II ozone profiles agreed within
   5\% in altitude range from 18 km to 40 km and within 10\% up to 45 km.
   The lidar and NCEP temperatures agreed within 7 K in the 35- to 50-km
   range. Ozone levels were highest in spring at altitudes below 20 km.
   Above 30 km, the ozone maximum occurred during summer. The annual cycle
   of temperature is observed with a spring maximum for all altitudes in
   the 35- to 50-km range. Ozone variations caused by the quasi-biennial
   oscillation (QBO) and the 11-year solar cycle are discussed. The ozone
   trends after subtraction of the QBO and solar effects for the altitude
   range from 30 to 40 km are -6.0 +/- 0.5\%/decade for the period from
   1988 to 1997 and statistically insignificant after 1998.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the first arrival dates of 25 migrant bird species
   recorded at Portland, Dorset, UK for the period 1959-2005. To determine
   if trends over time existed, linear regression of first arrival dates on
   year was used; initially for the whole period and subsequently
   separately for 1959-1981 and 1982-2005. First arrival dates were
   compared to spring temperatures along migration routes in southern
   Europe and France and in the UK. The arrival of 11 species (e.g. Sand
   Martin, Blackcap and Pied Flycatcher) was significantly earlier with the
   mean trend for all species showing an advance of 1.6 days/decade over
   the study period. Over all species, trends in first arrival date were
   not significantly different between the two time periods but there were
   differences for Turtle Dove, Whitethroat and Lesser Whitethroat. Monthly
   mean temperatures along the European part of the birds' migration route
   were generally negatively correlated with, but can only explain < 30\%
   of the variability in, first arrival dates. The consequences of both a
   changed phenology and differential phenological changes between species
   require urgent investigation.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the validity of forecasting air temperature ranges
   in 2100 using the SimCLIM climate projection model at spatial and
   temporal scales within the Southern Levantine basin. The model utilized
   historical air temperature data from 2000 to 2016, collected at seven
   southeastern Mediterranean stations, as well as 74 climate pattern
   ensembles integrated within SimCLIM. A combination of 40 global climate
   models (GCMs) and IPCC AR5 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios embedded
   in SimCLIM was employed to forecast mean, minimum, and maximum
   temperatures for 2100.The findings reveal that the average temperature
   increase in 2100, relative to the representative concentration pathways
   2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, will range between 0.8-1.17 degrees C, 1.48-2.0
   degrees C, 2.1-3.8 degrees C, and 3.9-4.6 degrees C, respectively. Due
   to its acceptable accuracy, the SimCLIM model, incorporating 40 GCMs and
   74 climate pattern ensembles, is highly recommended for forecasting
   future climate conditions. The model was evaluated using available
   temperature records in the study area, yielding a prediction percentage
   error of 2\%, which strongly supports the use of SimCLIM.},

Pages = {1597-1607},

Abstract = {The Greenland ice sheet has experienced significant melt over the past 6
   decades, with extreme melt events covering large areas of the ice sheet.
   Melt events are typically analysed using summary statistics, but the
   nature and characteristics of the events themselves are less frequently
   analysed. Our work examines melt events from a statistical perspective
   by modelling 19 years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) ice surface temperature data using a Gaussian mixture model. We
   use a mixture model with separate model components for ice and meltwater
   temperatures at 1139 cells spaced across the ice sheet. By considering
   the uncertainty in the ice surface temperature measurements, we use the
   two categories of model components to define, for each observation, a
   probability of melt which is independent of any pre-defined fixed melt
   threshold. This probability can then be used to estimate the expected
   number of melt events at a given cell. Furthermore, the model can be
   used to estimate temperature quantiles at a given cell and analyse
   temperature and melt trends over time by fitting the model to subsets of
   time. Fitting the model to data from 2001-2009 and 2010-2019 shows
   increases in melt probability and yearly expected maximum temperatures
   for significant portions of the ice sheet.},

Abstract = {Using linear and quadratic regression approaches, the present work aims
   at drawing the general long-term behaviour of the mean annual surface
   temperature and salinity anomalies (MASTA \& MASSA) within the South
   Atlantic and the South Pacific Oceans. The dataset covers 103 years
   (1911-2013) within the former, while it covers 155 years (1859-2013)
   within the latter ocean. The MASTA variations in the two southern oceans
   reflect opposite linear and quadratic trends of variations. The linear
   trends of MASSA are also in contrast. On the other hand, the quadratic
   regression, reflecting a cyclic trend of variation in the MASSA, has the
   same parabolic form in the two basins but with different years of
   maximum occurrence. The decreasing trends in the MASSA of Pacific Ocean
   may be attributed to the ice melting process, the interannual
   variability of evaporation and the amount of precipitation over the
   Pacific than on the Atlantic.},

Pages = {955-971},
Abstract = {In this study, drought conditions involving risk of fires are detected
   applying SMOSderived soil moisture data and land surface temperature
   models. Moisture-temperature (SM-LST) patterns studied between 2010 and
   2014 were linked to main fire regimes in the Iberian Peninsula. Most
   wildfires burned in warm and dry soils, but the analysis of pre-fire
   conditions differed among seasons. Absolute values of SM-LST were useful
   to detect proneto-fire conditions during summer and early autumn.
   Complementarily, SM-LST anomalies were related to droughts and high fire
   activity in October 2011 and February-March 2012. These episodes were
   coincident with abnormally anticyclonic atmospheric conditions. Results
   show that combined trends of new soil moisture space-borne data and
   temperature models could enhance fire risk assessment capabilities. This
   contribution should be helpful to face the expected increase of wildfire
   activity derived from climate change.},

Abstract = {This study first homogenizes time series of daily maximum and minimum
   temperatures recorded at 825 stations in China over the period from 1951
   to 2010, using both metadata and the penalized maximum t test with the
   first-order autocorrelation being accounted for to detect change points
   and using the quantile-matching algorithm to adjust the data time series
   to diminish discontinuities. Station relocation was found to be the main
   cause for discontinuities, followed by station automation. The effects
   of discontinuities on estimation of long-term trends in the annual mean
   and extreme indices of temperature are illustrated. The data
   homogenization is shown to have improved the spatial consistency of
   estimated trends. Using the homogenized daily minimum and daily maximum
   temperature data, this study also analyzes trends in extreme temperature
   indices. The results show that the vast majority (85\%-90\%) of the 825
   sites have experienced significantly more warm nights and less cold
   nights since 1951. There have also been more warm days and less cold
   days since 1951, although these trends are less extensive. About 62\% of
   the 825 sites were found to have experienced significantly more warm
   days and about 50\% significantly less cold days. None of the 825 sites
   were found to have significantly more cold nights/days or less warm
   nights/days. These indicate that the warming is stronger in nighttime
   than in daytime and stronger in winter than in summer. Thus, the diurnal
   temperature range was found to have significantly decreased at 49\% of
   the 825 sites, with significant increases being identified only at 3\%
   of these sites.},

Abstract = {As it was shown recently, climate changes in Antarctica resulted in
   interannual trends of some climatic parameters like sea level
   atmospheric pressure, surface air temperature, ice thickness and others.
   These tendencies have effect on the Southern Ocean meteorological and
   hydrological regime. The following remote sensing data: AVHRR MCSST
   data, satellite altimetry data (merged data of mission ERS-2,
   TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, ENVISAT, GFO-1) are used to analyze the
   interannual and/or climatic tendency of sea surface temperature (SST)
   and sea level anomaly (SLA). According to the obtained results, SST has
   positive trend 0.01 +/- 0.005 degrees C yr(-1) within 300-1000 km band
   northward of the Antarctic coast and negative trend -0.02 +/- 0.003
   degrees C yr-1 on average for the Southern Ocean for 24-yr record
   (1982-2005). SLA has interannual trend 0.24 +/- 0.026 cm yr(-1) for
   12-yr record (1993-2005). However in some areas (for example,
   Pacific-Antarctic Ridge) SST and SLA tendencies are stronger -0.065 +/-
   0.007 degrees C yr(-1) and -0.21 +/- 0.05 cm yr(-1), respectively.},

Title = {Rise in Mid-Tropospheric Temperature Trend (MSU/AMSU 1978-2022) over the
   Tibet and Eastern Himalayas},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The high-altitude Hindu Kush-Himalayan region (HKH, average similar to 5
   km from msl) and the adjacent Indo-Gangetic plains (IG plains, similar
   to 0-250 m msl), due to their geographical location and complex
   topography, are reported to be highly sensitive to climatic changes.
   Recent studies show that the impacts of climate change and associated
   changes in water resources (glacial/snow melt water and rainfall) in
   this region are multifaceted, thereby affecting ecosystems, agriculture,
   industries, and inhabitants. In this study, 45 years of Microwave
   Sounding Unit/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU/AMSU)-derived
   mid-tropospheric temperature (TMT, 3-7 km altitude) and lower
   tropospheric temperature (TLT, 0-3 km altitude) data from the Remote
   Sensing Systems (RSS Version 4.0) were utilized to analyze the overall
   changes in tropospheric temperature in terms of annual/monthly trends
   and anomalies. The current study shows that the mid-tropospheric
   temperature (0-3 km altitude over the HKH region) has already alarmingly
   increased (statistically significant) in Tibet, the western Himalayas,
   and the eastern Himalayas by 1.49 degrees K, 1.30 degrees K, and 1.35
   degrees K, respectively, over the last 45 years (1978-2022). As compared
   to a previous report (TMT trend for 30 years, 1979-2008), the present
   study of TMT trends for 45 years (1978-2022) exhibits a rise in percent
   change in the trend component in the high-altitude regions of Tibet, the
   western Himalayas, and the eastern Himalayas by approximately 310\%,
   80\%, and 170\%, respectively. In contrast, the same for adjacent plains
   (the western and eastern IG plains) shows a negligible or much lower
   percent change (0\% and 40\%, respectively) over the last 14 years.
   Similarly, dust source regions in Africa, Arabia, the Middle East, Iran,
   and Pakistan show only a 130\% change in warming trends over the past 14
   years. In the monthly breakup, the `November to March' period usually
   shows a higher TMT trend (with peaks in December, February, and March)
   compared to the rest of the months, except in the western Himalayas,
   where the peak is observed in May, which can be attributed to the peak
   dust storm activity (March to May). Snow cover over the HKH region,
   where the growing season is known to be from September to February, is
   also reported to show the highest snow cover in February (with the peak
   in January, February, or March), which coincides with the warmest period
   in terms of anomaly and trend observed in the long-term mid-tropospheric
   temperature data (1978-2022). Thus, the current study highlights that
   the statistically significant and positive TMT warming trend (95\% CI)
   and its observed acceleration over the high-altitude region (since 2008)
   can be attributed to being one of the major factors causing an
   acceleration in the rate of melting of snow cover and glaciers,
   particularly in Tibet and the Eastern Himalayas.},

Title = {Southern Hemisphere temperature trend in association with greenhouse

Abstract = {In this study, the trend of mean seasonal and annual temperatures of the
   Southern Hemisphere was calculated based on the HadCRUT5 and NASA-GISS
   data networks, for the period 1901-2021 and 1951-2021. In order to
   determine the possible effects on temperature, man, or nature, the
   relationship with CO2 concentration, GHG (greenhouse gases) radiation
   exposure, and teleconnections ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) and
   AAO (Antarctic Oscillation) was examined. The obtained results indicate
   that there is a significant increasing trend of seasonal and annual
   temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere, which intensified in the period
   between 1951 and 2021 (from 0.11 to 0.12 degrees C per decade).
   According to climate models, one of the indicators of the dominance of
   the anthropogenic greenhouse effect is the polar amplification (more
   intense temperature rise going from the equator to the poles). However,
   polar amplification was not recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, due to
   the fact that there was the smallest increase in temperature in the belt
   between 44 degrees S-64 degrees S. Moreover, in the mentioned zone, the
   positive trend was smaller in the period between 1951 and 2021 than in
   the period between 1901 and 2021, which was not to be expected.
   Nevertheless, the Southern Hemisphere temperature showed a statistically
   significantly strong correlation with the concentration of CO2 observed
   at the Mauna Loa station. It was also found that there is a significant
   relationship between the energy impact of greenhouse gases and the
   Southern Hemisphere temperature, which is logical, because with the
   growth of GHG, positive radiative forcing increases. When it comes to
   the impact of telecommunications, both considered teleconnections (ENSO
   and AAO) have an impact on changes in the temperature of the Southern
   Hemisphere.},

Title = {Development Trend of Cooling Technology for Turbine Blades at Super-High
   Temperature of above 2000 K},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Aeroengines and heavy-duty gas turbines are the core power equipment in
   the field of national defense and energy. Their research and development
   (R\&D) level and manufacturing level represent the status of a country's
   heavy industry in the world. The common cooling technologies of turbine
   blades including impingement cooling, film cooling, effusion cooling,
   layer cooling, pin fin cooling, and rough ribs were introduced in this
   paper. With the continuous improvement of the efficiency and performance
   of aeroengines and gas turbines, the turbine inlet temperature increases
   gradually every year; turbine blades will be exposed to higher gas
   temperatures in the future as gas temperatures break 2000 K. In order to
   ensure the safe operation of turbine blades under severe super-high
   temperature working conditions, cooling technology must be developed
   emphatically. This paper first reviews the research status of turbine
   blade cooling technology and points out future research focuses. The
   development trends of next-generation turbine blade cooling technology
   for above 2000 K temperature are summarized from several aspects: the
   innovative excavation of high-efficiency composite cooling
   configuration, multi-objective cooperative cooling structure and
   optimization design based on 3D printing, composite cooling structure
   design and optimization based on an artificial intelligence algorithm,
   tapping the cooling potential of new cooling media and heat pipes,
   integrated thermal protection with new thermal insulators, and the
   application of low-resistance and high-efficiency surface dimple
   cooling. The summary of this paper can provide a reference for the
   researchers of turbine blade cooling technology.},

Title = {Main Trends and Research Directions in Hydrogen Generation Using Low
   Temperature Electrolysis: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hydrogen (H-2) is the most abundant element in the universe and it is
   also a neutral energy carrier, meaning the environmental effects of
   using it are strictly related to the effects of creating the means of
   producing of that amount of Hydrogen. So far, the H-2 generation by
   water electrolysis research field did not manage to break the efficiency
   barrier in order to consider H-2 production as a technology that
   sustains financially its self-development. However, given the complexity
   of this technology and the overall environmental impacts, an up-to-date
   research and development status review is critical. Thus, this study
   aims to identify the main trends, achievements and research directions
   of the H-2 generation using pure and alkaline water electrolysis,
   providing a review of the state of the art in the specific literature.
   Methods: In order to deliver this, a Systematic Literature Review was
   carried out, using PRISMA methodology, highlighting the research trends
   and results in peer review publish articles over more than two years
   (2020-2022). Findings: This review identifies niches and actual status
   of the H-2 generation by water and alkaline water electrolysis and
   points out, in numbers, the boundaries of the 2020-2022 timeline
   research.},

Title = {Evaluation of CMIP6 models in the representation of observed extreme
   temperature indices trends in South America},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Number = {1-2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The consequences of climate change are particularly noticeable through
   extreme events, which have already changed in intensity and frequency
   worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the ability of 33 CMIP6 models to
   simulate the observed trends of four extreme temperature indices in
   South America during the period 1979-2014. We use daily minimum and
   maximum temperatures from an observational database, ERA5 reanalysis,
   and CMIP6 models to estimate the international indices: cold nights,
   warm nights, cold days, and warm days. Trends are calculated using Sen's
   slope for different seasons and spatial scales (continental,
   sub-regional, and at each grid point) and tested with the Mann-Kendall
   test. All databases agree on an increase (decrease) in the frequency of
   warm (cold) extremes in South America, with the most intense changes in
   the austral spring. In particular, the warm nights index and the
   northern sub-regions of South America show the most pronounced trends.
   In contrast, in the southern sub-regions of South America, the
   observations do not indicate significant trends of the minimum
   temperature indices, which differ from the trends estimated by the CMIP6
   ensemble median and most of the individual models. In general, the
   ensemble median simulates significant long-term changes at almost all
   grid points, unlike the observations and reanalysis. Finally, the
   simulated trends related to minimum temperature are slightly better
   represented than those related to maximum temperatures. Nevertheless,
   neither model stands out as the best, and all of them have difficulty
   simulating trends, especially for cold days.},

Title = {Reassessment of urbanization effect on surface air temperature trends at
   an urban station of North China},
Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {131},
Number = {2},
Pages = {237-250},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Based on a homogenized data set of monthly mean temperature, minimum
   temperature, and maximum temperature at Shijiazhuang City Meteorological
   Station (Shijiazhuang station) and four rural meteorological stations
   selected applying a more sophisticated methodology, we reanalyzed the
   urbanization effects on annual, seasonal, and monthly mean surface air
   temperature (SAT) trends for updated time period 1960-2012 at the
   typical urban station in North China. The results showed that (1)
   urbanization effects on the long-term trends of annual mean SAT, minimum
   SAT, and diurnal temperature range (DTR) in the last 53 years reached
   0.25, 0.47, and -0.50 degrees C/decade, respectively, all statistically
   significant at the 0.001 confidence level, with the contributions from
   urbanization effects to the overall long-term trends reaching 67.8,
   78.6, and 100\%, respectively; (2) the urbanization effects on the
   trends of seasonal mean SAT, minimum SAT, and DTR were also large and
   statistically highly significant. Except for November and December, the
   urbanization effects on monthly mean SAT, minimum SAT, and DTR were also
   all statistically significant at the 0.05 confidence level; and (3) the
   annual, seasonal, and monthly mean maximum SAT series at the urban
   station registered a generally weaker and non-significant urbanization
   effect. The updated analysis evidenced that our previous work for this
   same urban station had underestimated the urbanization effect and its
   contribution to the overall changes in the SAT series. Many similar
   urban stations were being included in the current national and regional
   SAT data sets, and the results of this paper further indicated the
   importance and urgency for paying more attention to the urbanization
   bias in the monitoring and detection of global and regional SAT change
   based on the data sets.},

Title = {Trends and relationship between chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and sea surface
   temperature in the central equatorial Indian Ocean},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1093-1101},
Abstract = {This work presents the trend analysis and relationship between
   chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) in
   the central equatorial Indian Ocean (CEIO) using Aqua MODIS chl-a
   Level-3 Standard Mapped Image (SMI) data for a period of 10 years
   (2002-2012). In order to understand the monsoonal variability of chl-a
   concentration and SST and to evaluate their relationships over the CEIO,
   trend analysis of chl-a values was carried out. The area average chl-a
   concentration in the region shows a weak annual cycle with high
   concentration during winter (October-December) and low in summer (June).
   High chl-a concentration (similar to 0.22 mg m(-3)) is observed during
   early winter in the region. Chl-a concentration starts decreasing from
   March onwards until the onset of summer monsoon. The data reveal low
   chl-a concentrations during summer period, i.e., from June to September,
   which is in accordance with several observations, and higher
   concentrations during October to December. The other reason is that
   satellite sensor may not capture chl-a variability more accurately
   because of cloud cover during summer monsoon time. A reasonably
   significant coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.51; significant at p <
   0.05 level) between SST and chl-a concentration is recorded. This study
   clearly suggests that the SST acts as a proxy for variables which cause
   high chl-a concentration in the CEIO.},

Abstract = {Over the last three years, numerous laboratory tests have been conducted
   with the goal of identifying the root cause of the temperature trending
   phenomenon observed in tapered roller bearings during their field
   service. The experimental efforts were successful In duplicating the
   temperature trending phenomenon in the lab, and concluded that vibration
   induced roller misalignment was responsible for this troubling
   phenomenon; yet field verification of these findings was still missing.
   To this end, a collaborative on-track field test was carefully planned
   and executed by The Amsted Rail Company, The Union Pacific Railroad
   (UP), Rail Sciences Inc. (RSI), and The University of Texas-Pan American
   (UTPA). A locomotive, a business car, and two coal cars - one fully
   loaded and one empty - were made available by the UP for the purposes of
   this test. Four bearings that exhibited temperature trending during the
   laboratory testing, and two other bearings that were set-out for
   temperature trending by the UP, were mounted next to six high impact
   wheels of at least 70 kips. The impact wheels were used as external
   vibration sources. Three of these wheels were placed under the fully
   loaded coal car, and the other three under the empty car. The remaining
   components used in the test were all defect free bearings and wheels.
   All sixteen bearings were instrumented with themocouples and
   accelerometers, with four additional accelerometers monitoring the track
   joints and defects and the car pitch and bounce. This paper provides a
   summary of the initial analysis of the acquired data which indicates
   that the field test was Successful in verifying the laboratory findings.},

Abstract = {Bremer and Berger (J. Atmos. Solar Terr. Phys. 64 (2002) 805) applied a
   correction for trends in the NO concentration and alpha(eff) in the
   interpretation of trends in the low frequency (LF) phase height
   measurements and obtained results less consistent with model simulations
   as well as the observed trends in mesospheric temperatures. The
   correction is shown to be too large most probably due to the application
   of inappropriate trends in alpha(eff) of Chakrabarry (Adv. Space Res. 20
   (1997) 2 117), which yield a trend in electron density opposite to that
   which is observed. The discrepancy between the observational data and
   model-simulated trends of Bremer and Berger (J. Atoms. Solar. Terr.
   Phys. 64 (2002) 805) in the LF phase heights can be largely removed.
   Even more important, the trends in mesospheric temperatures inferred by
   Bremer and Bremer (J. Atmos. Solar Terr. Phys. 64 (2002) 805) from
   trends in the LF phase heights without the inappropriate correction
   agree well with the results of analysis of a global set of results on
   trends in the mesospheric temperatures by Beig et al. (Rev. Geophys. 41

Journal = {GENETICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {76},
Number = {3},
Pages = {237-247},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Thirteen linear wing dimensions were measured in 10 isofemale lines of
   Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans grown at seven constant
   temperatures from 12 to 31 degreesC. Within-line (environmental)
   variability, estimated by the within-line coefficient of variation
   (CVw), exhibited similar variation patterns in the two species, that is
   higher values at extreme (low or high) temperatures. The magnitude of
   variation was, however, greater in D. simulans which appears to be more
   responsive to thermal change. A clear hyperbolic relationship between
   trait mean value and CVw was also observed in both species, arising from
   measurement errors which are relatively more pronounced on shorter
   traits. Genetic variability was analysed bq considering both the genetic
   CV (CVg, evolvability) and isofemale line heritability (intraclass
   correlation). Both parameters provided independent information, as shown
   by a lack of correlation between them. Moreover, CVg was negatively
   correlated M with trait mean value, while heritability showed a positive
   correlation. With respect to thermal environment, both parameters
   exhibited similar reaction patterns which contrasted the two species.
   Genetic variability in D. melanogaster followed a convex reaction norm,
   with higher values at extreme (high or low) temperatures, and this
   observation agrees with previous independent investigations.
   Surprisingly, D. simulans revealed an opposite pattern, with a maximum
   genetic variability in the middle of the range. Such data point to the
   danger of drawing general conclusions from the analysis of a single
   species.},

Abstract = {A method for estimating the drift function and assessing the
   significance of possible trends in spatial observations was developed.
   This method takes as many data points as possible within each lag
   distance, is less sensitive to ``outliers{''}, and nearly all
   observations obtained by it have their contribution in calculating the
   drift function. Our method, as well as the ``cancellation method{''},
   were examined on temperature data collected at a depth of 0.05 m at
   0.68-m intervals along an 80-m long transect. Tests based on the
   cancellation method falsely indicated the presence of a significant
   trend in the temperature data. No trend was indicated by our method,
   which has more statistical validity than the cancellation method. The
   decision to detrend or not has a marked impact on the interpretation of
   the data as attested to by the semivariograms and autocorrelograms of
   the original and detrended data. Detrending of the data resulted in a
   loss of information about the spatial dependence of temperature

Title = {Using Quantile Regression to Estimate Spatial Patterns of Surface
   Temperature Trends over the Territory of Russia},

Abstract = {This work involves calculations of climatic trends of anomalies in daily
   minimum, maximum, and average air temperatures based on the quantile
   regression method (QRM), which allows one to estimate trends in detail
   for any quantile in the range of quantile values from 0 to 1. Based on
   the QRM climate trend calculations detailed for different quantiles of
   trends in daily air temperature anomalies, clustering of more than 1400
   meteorological stations of Russia is performed. Clustering is carried
   out in the multidimensional space, the formation of which takes into
   account seasonal peculiarities of the QRM trends of anomalies for three
   types of daily temperatures (daily minimum, maximum, and average
   temperatures) and features of the QRM trends in different parts of the
   quantile range. Twelve clusters of weather stations have been
   distinguished in the created multidimensional space using the k-means
   method. The stations that are included in each of the distinguished
   clusters are similar in terms of manifestation of the QRM trends of
   temperature. Despite the absence of characteristics of the geographical
   location of the observation stations among the variables of the
   multidimensional space, the stations within each of the twelve
   distinguished clusters are situated geographically quite compactly. The
   geographical distribution of stations assigned to different clusters is
   demonstrated and discussed. Based on the results of clustering, some
   features of quantile trends of temperature anomalies of specific seasons
   within the groups of stations assigned to individual clusters are
   described. Differences in manifestation of quantile trends between 12
   clusters of Russian stations distinguished based on QRM quantile trends
   are obvious. At the same time, however, significant similarities can be
   observed between some individual pairs of clusters. The approaches and
   results of this work can be used to improve the climatic zoning of the
   Russian territory, which seems to be very relevant for the preparation
   and implementation of regional plans of adaptation to climate changes.
   The results can also be used for solving various applied climatology
   problems based on calculations of quantiles of different meteorological
   parameters.},

Abstract = {Structural properties of iron-oxide nanoparticles deeply affect their
   magnetic performance in many applications such as with superparamagnetic
   relaxometry, when employed as cell-targeted magnetic nanoparticles for
   in vivo diagnostics. In this work, we present a detailed
   characterization of model nanoparticles for this application, with an
   average size of similar to 25 nm and a narrow size dispersion (sigma <
   7\%). Considering the intrinsic structural properties of these model
   nanoparticles, the study of temperature dependence and correlation
   between dc-magnetization and superconducting quantum interference
   detector-relaxometry are discussed based on known theoretical
   predictions and computer simulations of the magnetic dipole moment and
   characteristic decay constants. Furthermore, computer simulations
   provide support in clarifying how important the overall collective
   magnetization is affected by particle size dispersion, which has a
   direct role on sustaining the magnetic relaxation signal in the
   temperature range required in preclinical and clinical settings.

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {In this research, the mean relative humidity (RH) trend was investigated
   in the monthly, seasonal and annual timescales during 1960-2005 in 32
   synoptic meteorological stations. The Mann-Kendall test after the
   removal of the significant lag-1 serial correlation effect from the RH
   time series by pre-whitening was used to determine significant trends.
   Sen's slope estimator was used to determine the median slope of positive
   or negative RH trends in seasonal and annual timescales. Also, in order
   to facilitate trend analysis and exploring in datasets, 10-year moving
   average low-pass filter was applied on mean annual normalized RH.
   Furthermore, smoothed time series by the mentioned filter were
   classified in four clusters and then they were mapped to show the
   spatial distribution of trend patterns in Iran. Results showed both
   significant downward and upward trends, but the number of negative
   trends was more than positive ones. In general, the stations located in
   arid central and eastern parts of country had more negative trends.
   Results of the Sen's slope estimator showed that in annual timescale,
   Gorgan synoptic station had the most increasing slope by (+) 2 \% per
   decade, while the most negative slope was detected in Bam by (-) 2.79 \%
   per decade. Also, the analysis of smoothed time series of RH and their
   relationship with smoothed temperatures showed a strong inverse
   relationship particularly after 1995. It can be concluded that alongside
   the increasing of temperature in many parts of Iran, lack of sufficient
   water vapor has led to decreasing trend of RH in the country.},

Abstract = {Previous works have shown that the combination of vegetation indices
   with land surface temperature (LST) improves the analysis of vegetation
   changes. Here, global MODIS-Terra monthly data from 2000 to 2011 were
   downloaded and organized into LST, NDVI (Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series. These
   time series were then corrected from cloud and atmospheric residual
   contamination through the IDR (iterative Interpolation for Data
   Reconstruction) method. Then, statistics were retrieved from both
   corrected time series, and the YLCD (Yearly Land Cover Dynamics)
   approach has been applied to data sources (NDVI-LST and EVI-LST) to
   analyze changes in the vegetation. Finally, trends were retrieved and
   their statistical significance was assessed through the Mann-Kendall
   statistical framework. Global statistics show that both data sets lead
   to similar trends, as is the case for the spatial distribution of
   observed trends. These trends confirm previous results as well as
   prediction of climate warming consequences, such as a marked increase in
   boreal temperatures.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to provide information on the sea level and
   upper ocean temperature variability and trends in the Cook Islands
   region within a global context. Oceanic fisheries variability and change
   take place within the physical environment. Because the state of the
   historical data set is not as would be desired, we begin with some
   review of data distribution issues. We provide some new results from the
   Cook Islands region but draw upon previous work for information about
   the global and ocean-basin scale context. There are clear trends over
   recent decades in sea level and, generally, in upper ocean temperature,
   but there is also substantial interannual and interdecadal variability,
   which are larger locally than globally. Because of this variability, it
   is not possible to say if recent Cook Islands regional trends are
   representative of longer-term trends, or if longer-term trends have
   increased recently. Trends in the Cook Islands region over the last four
   decades are similar to 0.1-0.3 degrees C per decade in near surface
   temperature and similar to 2-3 cm sea level per decade.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change and related ocean warming have affected marine ecological
   and socioeconomic systems worldwide. Therefore, it is critically
   important to assess the performance of conservation mechanisms,
   particularly marine protected areas (MPAs) to moderate the risks of
   climate-related impacts. In this study, sea surface temperature trends
   of Australian Commonwealth MPAs are assessed against climate change
   management criteria, as defined in Adapting to Climate Change: Guidance
   for Protected Area Managers and Planners. Monthly sea surface
   temperature trends between 1993 and 2017 were statistically assessed
   using the Mann-Kendall trend test and management plans were subject to a
   thematic analysis. Temperature trends showed variable SST changes among
   the regions, with the northern reserves all showing statistically
   significant increases in temperature, and the Southwest Network having
   the least number of reserves with statistically significant increases in
   temperature. The thematic analysis shows that management plans address
   approximately half of the climate change adaptation criteria. Several
   management strategies, such as dynamic MPAs, replication, and
   translocations, are currently absent and have been suggested as
   necessary tools in supporting the climate readiness of Australian MPAs.
   This study is significant because it helps to identify and synthesize
   regions most vulnerable to the impacts of ocean warming and provides
   management suggestions make MPAs ``climate ready.{''}},

Title = {Temperature Changes in the Maloti-Drakensberg Region: An Analysis of

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Nature has been adversely affected by increasing industrialization,
   especially during the latter part of the last century, as a result of
   accelerating technological development, unplanned urbanization,
   incorrect agricultural policies and deforestation, which have
   contributed to the elevated concentration of the greenhouse gases (GHGs)
   in the environment. GHG accumulation has an adverse impact on
   meteorological and hydro-meteorological parameters, particularly
   temperature. Temperature plays a prominent and well-known role in
   evaporation, transpiration and changes in water demand, and thus
   significantly affects both water availability and food security.
   Therefore, a systematic understanding of temperature is important for
   fighting food insecurity and household poverty. Variations in
   temperature are often assessed and characterized through trend analysis.
   Hence, the objective of this paper is to determine long-term trends in
   mean monthly maximum and minimum air temperatures for the
   Maloti-Drakensberg region. The Mann-Kendall test, a non-parametric test,
   was applied on mean air temperature for the 1960-2016 period. A
   significant rising trend (p < 0.001) was detected with a yearly change
   in the long term annual mean maximum and mean minimum temperature by
   0.03 degrees C/annum and 0.01 degrees C/annum, respectively. This
   knowledge has important implications for both the state of the
   environment and livelihoods in the region, since its use can be useful
   in planning and policymaking in water resource management, biodiversity
   conservation, agriculture, tourism and other sectors of the economy
   within the region.},

Abstract = {Olive tree is mainly cultivated in the temperate zones of the
   Mediterranean area. Temperatures are the main factors to evaluate the
   climatic suitability for olive cultivation. A study of the spatial and
   temporal variations of temperatures in a territory is necessary to
   define the most appropriate areas for production, as well as to evaluate
   different varieties. Spain has the largest area and high production of
   olives in the world. In this study, the trends of the average
   temperature of the olive growing period are analyzed by defining the
   olive growing station temperature (OGST) index. The active days for the
   olive tree were defined as those in which the average daily temperatures
   are above 14.4 degrees C between April and October. The minimum and
   maximum daily temperatures of 12 meteorological stations, from the
   meteorological services of the Spanish government (AEMET), located in
   the main olive growing areas (more than 90\% of the olive production in
   Spain is found in these areas) were used, considering a period from 1981
   to 2019. Mann-Kendal test and Sen's slope were applied to determine the
   trends and their magnitude. Results showed that all days between June
   and September were active days. The mean OGST value was 21.5 degrees C,
   varying between 20.1 degrees C in Albacete and 23.6 degrees C in
   Seville. It was also shown a significant increasing trend in the index
   in all areas. Temperatures in the olive tree growth period had increased
   by an average of 0.5 degrees C per decade, which represents an average
   increase of 1.9 degrees C between 1981 and 2019.},

Abstract = {This study analyses potential trends in river water temperature (Tw)
   over a period of 50 years (1960-2009). The study area is located in the
   Raba catchment in the Polish Carpathians. The aim of the study was to
   evaluate long-term trends in daily Tw for each season of the year as
   well as to compare the direction of these trends for sites located some
   distance upstream and downstream from the Dobczyce Reservoir (DR), built
   in 1986 on the Raba River. For autumn and winter, increases in mean,
   median, and minimum Tw are significant for the downstream site (39 km
   from the DR), with a rate of change of 0.18-0.26 degrees C per decade.
   Contrasting results were obtained for the spring and summer seasons;
   significant increases (0.22-0.47 degrees C per decade) in mean, median,
   and maximum Tw were found for the upstream site, in concordance with
   seasonal air temperature trends, but a significant decrease in maximum
   Tw (-0.42 and -0.35 degrees C per decade, respectively) was identified
   for the downstream site. The revealed discrepancies in the direction of
   seasonal trends for the upstream and downstream sites studied suggest an
   anthropogenic impact on Tw downstream from the DR. Overall, a
   significant increase in summer Tw suggest the need for appropriate
   flowing water management that would mitigate adverse effects of climate
   warming on the fluvial environment.},

Title = {Evolutionary force in confamiliar marine vertebrates of different
   temperature realms: adaptive trends in zoarcid fish transcriptomes},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Background: Studies of temperature-induced adaptation on the basis of
   genomic sequence data were mainly done in extremophiles. Although the
   general hypothesis of an increased molecular flexibility in the cold is
   widely accepted, the results of thermal adaptation are still difficult
   to detect at proteomic down to the genomic sequence level. Approaches
   towards a more detailed picture emerge with the advent of new sequencing
   technologies. Only small changes in primary protein structure have been
   shown to modify kinetic and thermal properties of enzymes, but likewise
   for interspecies comparisons a high genetic identity is still essential
   to specify common principles. The present study uses comprehensive
   transcriptomic sequence information to uncover general patterns of
   thermal adaptation on the RNA as well as protein primary structure.
   Results: By comparing orthologous sequences of two closely related
   zoarcid fish inhabiting different latitudinal zones (Antarctica:
   Pachycara brachycephalum, temperate zone: Zoarces viviparus) we were
   able to detect significant differences in the codon usage. In the
   cold-adapted species a lower GC content in the wobble position prevailed
   for preserved amino acids. We were able to estimate 40-60\% coverage of
   the functions represented within the two compared zoarcid cDNA-libraries
   on the basis of a reference genome of the phylogenetically closely
   related fish Gasterosteus aculeatus. A distinct pattern of amino acid
   substitutions could be identified for the non-synonymous codon
   exchanges, with a remarkable surplus of serine and reduction of glutamic
   acid and asparagine for the Antarctic species.
   Conclusion: Based on the differences between orthologous sequences from
   confamiliar species, distinguished mainly by the temperature regimes of
   their habitats, we hypothesize that temperature leaves a signature on
   the composition of biological macromolecules (RNA, proteins) with
   implications for the transcription and translation level. As the
   observed pattern of amino acid substitutions only partly support the
   flexibility hypothesis further evolutionary forces may be effective at
   the global transcriptome level.},

Abstract = {A National Research Council report {[}NRC 2000] has highlighted the
   disparity between surface temperature trends (from thermometer readings)
   versus those from MSU instruments in weather satellites and radiosondes
   carried in weather balloons. The global surface record shows a
   substantial warming trend in the last twenty years while the atmospheric
   data from both MSU and radiosondes show little if any warming. As is
   well understood, climate models predict the opposite, namely a stronger
   warming trend for the troposphere than for the surface.
   In order to better understand the disparity between surface and
   atmospheric data, we investigated the latitude, altitude, and seasonal
   dependence of all the trends. We also calculated separate trend values
   for two periods, `79-'98 and `89-'99.
   We discuss several explanations for the observed disparity: ozone
   depletion, volcanism, ENSO, and increase in GH gases. After rejecting
   these, we conclude that PDO may be a candidate. But it is also possible
   that the global surface trends are not credible; they need further
   scrutiny. Well-controlled surface temperature data for the United States
   do not show an appreciable post-1940 warming, in contrast to the global
   surface data. In addition, proxy data from tree rings, ice cores, etc.
   show no post-1940 warming: Many even show a cooling trend after 1940.},

Title = {Unique Temperature Trend Pattern Associated With Internally Driven
   Global Cooling and Arctic Warming During 1980-2022},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {Diagnosing the role of internal variability over recent decades is
   critically important for both model validation and projections of future
   warming. Recent research suggests that for 1980-2022 internal
   variability manifested as Global Cooling and Arctic Warming (i-GCAW),
   leading to enhanced Arctic Amplification (AA), and suppressed global
   warming over this period. Here we show that such an i-GCAW is rare in
   CMIP6 large ensembles, but simulations that do produce similar i-GCAW
   exhibit a unique and robust internally driven global surface air
   temperature (SAT) trend pattern. This unique SAT trend pattern features
   enhanced warming in the Barents and Kara Sea and cooling in the Tropical
   Eastern Pacific and Southern Ocean. Given that these features are
   imprinted in the observed record over recent decades, this work suggests
   that internal variability makes a crucial contribution to the
   discrepancy between observations and model-simulated forced SAT trend
   patterns.
   When comparing model simulations of Earth's recent warming to real-world
   observations, differences may arise from several factors. Two important
   factors are the model errors in the simulated response to increased
   greenhouse gases, and natural fluctuations within the climate system
   that produced discrepancies between observations and models. Thus,
   quantifying the role of these natural fluctuations is important for the
   assessment of model-observation differences. Previous studies have shown
   that natural climate variability has depressed global warming and
   enhanced Arctic warming. By compositing the multi-decadal trend patterns
   from CMIP6 simulations in which natural variability warms the Arctic but
   has a global cooling effect, we find that the majority of these model
   simulations also produce enhanced warming in the Barents and Kara Seas
   and cooling in the Tropical Eastern Pacific and Southern Ocean due to
   natural variability. Since these are the exact features imprinted on
   observed surface temperature changes over 1980-2022, our work suggests
   that natural variability is an important component of several noteworthy
   differences between models and observations.

Title = {Trends in intraseasonal temperature variability in Europe: Comparison of
   station data with gridded data and reanalyses},

Abstract = {Trends in temperature variability are often referred to have higher
   effect on temperature extremes than trends in the mean. We investigate
   trends in three complementary measures of intraseasonal temperature
   variability: (a) standard deviation of mean daily temperature (SD), (b)
   mean absolute value of day-to-day temperature change (DTD) and (c) 1-day
   lagged temporal autocorrelation of temperature (LAG). It is a
   well-established fact that different types of data (station, gridded,
   reanalyses) provide different temperature characteristics and
   particularly their trends. Moreover, we have uncovered that trends in
   measures of variability are considerably sensitive to data
   inhomogeneities. Therefore, we use five different datasets, one station
   based (ECA\&D), one gridded (EOBS) and three reanalyses (JRA-55,
   NCEP/NCAR, 20CR), and compare them. The period from 1961 to 2014 where
   all datasets overlap is examined, and the linear regression method is
   utilized to calculate trends of investigated measures in summer and
   winter. Intraseasonal temperature variability tends to decrease in
   winter, especially in eastern and northern Europe, where trends below
   -7\%<middle dot>decade-1 are detected for all measures. Decreases in DTD
   and LAG (indicating increase in persistence) prevail also in summer
   while summer SD tends to increase. The increase in the width of
   temperature distribution and the simultaneous increase in persistence
   indicate a tendency towards the rise in the frequency of extended
   extreme events in summer. Unlike previous studies, our results imply
   that reanalyses are not the least accurate in determining trends. JRA-55
   appears to be the least diverging from other datasets, while the largest
   discrepancies are detected for DTD at station data.
   The intraseasonal temperature variability tends to decrease in Europe in
   winter (see the top figure). This is especially true for DTD (day-to-day
   temperature change) and LAG (temporal autocorrelation of temperature),
   while for SD (standard deviation of temperature) only three out of five
   datasets exhibit a decrease. Differences between data sources in
   determining variability trends are the main concern of this paper and
   are quantified in the bottom figure. image},

Title = {Reconciling computational and experimental trends in the temperature
   dependence of the interfacial mobility of polymer films},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {152},
Number = {12},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Many measurements have indicated that thin polymer films in their glass
   state exhibit a mobile interfacial layer that grows in thickness upon
   heating, while some measurements indicate the opposite trend. Moreover,
   simulations and limited measurements on glass-forming liquids at
   temperatures above the glass transition temperature T-g exhibit a
   growing interfacial mobility scale xi upon cooling. To better understand
   these seemingly contradictory trends, we perform molecular dynamics
   simulations over a temperature regime for which our simulated polymer
   film enters a non-equilibrium glassy state and find that the relaxation
   time tau(alpha) within the film interior, relative to the polymer-air
   interfacial layer, exhibits a maximum near the computational T-g.
   Correspondingly, we also observe that the interfacial mobility length
   scale exhibits a maximum near T-g, explaining the apparent reversal in
   the temperature dependence of this scale between the glass and liquid
   states. We show that the non-monotonic variation of xi and the relative
   interfacial mobility to the film interior arise qualitatively from a
   non-monotonic variation of the gradient of the effective activation free
   energy of the film; we then obtain a quantitative description of this
   phenomenon by introducing a phenomenological model that describes the
   relaxation time layer-by-layer in the film for a temperature range both
   above and below T-g of the film as a whole. This analysis reveals that
   the non-monotonic trend in the relative interfacial mobility and xi both
   arise primarily from the distinctive temperature dependence of
   relaxation in the interfacial layer, which apparently remains in local
   equilibrium over the whole temperature range investigated.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal trend analysis of air temperature in Europe and Western
   Asia using data-coupled clustering},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {129},
Pages = {45-55},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the last decades, different machine learning techniques have been
   used to detect climate change patterns, mostly using data from measuring
   stations located in different parts of the world. Some previous studies
   focus on temperature as primary variable of study, though there have
   been other works focused on precipitation or even wind speed as
   objective variable. In this paper, we use the self-organized Second
   Order Data Coupled Clustering (SODCC) algorithm to carry out a
   spatio-temporal analysis of temperature patterns in Europe. By applying
   the SODCC we identify three different regimes of spatio-temporal
   correlations based on their geographical extent: small, medium, and
   large-scale regimes. Based on these regimes, it is possible to detect a
   change in the spatio-temporal trend of air temperature, reflecting a
   shift in the extent of the correlations in stations in the Iberian
   Peninsula and Southern France. We also identify an oscillating
   spatio-temporal trend in the Western Asia region and a stable
   medium-scale regime affecting the British Isles. These results are found
   to be consistent with previous studies in climate change. The patterns
   obtained with the SODCC algorithm may represent a signal of climate
   change to be taken into account, and so the SODCC could be used as
   detection method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Urbanization Effect on Trends of Extreme Temperature Indices of National

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Understanding the long-term change of extreme temperature events is
   important to the detection and attribution of climate change. It is
   unclear, however, how much effect urbanization has had on trends of the
   extreme temperature indices series constructed based on the commonly
   used datasets on a subcontinental scale. Applying a homogenized daily
   temperature dataset of the national reference climate stations and basic
   meteorological stations, and a rural station network previously
   developed, urbanization effects on trends of extreme temperature indices
   in mainland China for the time period 1961-2008 are evaluated. It is
   found that 1) the country-averaged annual- and seasonal-mean extreme
   temperature indices series generally experience statistically
   significant trends; 2) annual-mean urbanization effects in the country
   as a whole are statistically significant for daily minimum temperature
   (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), and mean temperature of Tmin and
   Tmax (Tavg), reaching 0.070 degrees, 0.023 degrees, and 0.047 degrees C
   (10 yr)(-1), respectively, with the largest values for annual-mean Tmin
   occurring in north China; 3) annual- and seasonal-mean urbanization
   effects for the declining diurnal temperature range (DTR) are highly
   significant, and the largest seasonal-mean DTR decline because of
   urbanization occurs in winter and spring; 4) annual-mean urbanization
   effects for the lowest Tmin, summer days, tropical nights, and frost
   days series are significant, but an insignificant urbanization effect is
   detected for icing days series; 5) urbanization has led to a highly
   significant decline of annual cold nights at a rate of -1.485 days (10
   yr)(-1) and a highly significant increase of annual warm nights at a
   rate of 2.264 days (10 yr)(-1). Although urbanization effects are also
   significant for cold days and warm days, they are relatively smaller,
   and 6) the smallest absolute values of annual-mean urbanization effects
   for most of the indices series are found to dominantly appear during
   1966-76, a well-known deurbanization period resulting from the Cultural
   Revolution.},

Abstract = {The effect of ambient temperature before and during laying on egg volume
   in birds has been studied by many authors. The objective of this paper
   is to show that trends in daily temperatures changes can also influence
   egg volume. The study was carried out near Warsaw, Poland in 1994 and
   1995. We ascertained the laying sequence, size and volume of 1070 eggs
   in 211 clutches of the Tree Sparrow. The effect of the trend in
   temperature on the mean egg volume in a clutch explained 0.4\% of its
   variation (0.03\%, to 4.2\%, depending on the brood-period), and the
   effect of actual temperature explained 0.9\% (0.5\% to 1.6\% depending
   on the brood-period). The joint effect of temperature and its trend
   explained 3.1\% (1.7\% to 8.9\% depending on the brood-period) of
   variation in the mean egg volume in a clutch. The authors discuss
   possible mechanisms of the effect of temperature and temperature trend
   on egg volume.},

Abstract = {This is a study done to investigate the effects of solar radiation on
   the wall surface temperature of a modern terrace house. It involves the
   analysis of the thermal fluctuations of common building materials used
   for walls or vertical surface areas such as the bricks, glass of the
   window, and metal doors. A thermal imager and data logging system was
   used in collecting the data for the Southeast and Northwest facades of
   the house. The imager gave resourceful data on the thermal heat trend of
   the walls and their surface temperature. The results show that a lighter
   wall surface color reduces the temperature of the surface. Furthermore,
   the bricks, which have a higher density hence a higher absorptivity due
   to their high capacity for storage of heat, decrease the flow of heat.
   However, the use of tinted glass on windows increases the surface
   temperature of the glass area of the wall surface. The metal also shows
   a high similarity with glass in terms of its thermal performance. In
   conclusion, the types of material used on wall surfaces have a
   significant impact on the wall temperature.},

Abstract = {No records exist to evaluate long-term pH dynamics in high-latitude
   oceans, which have the greatest probability of rapid acidification from
   anthropogenic CO2 emissions. We reconstructed both seasonal variability
   and anthropogenic change in seawater pH and temperature by using laser
   ablation high-resolution 2D images of stable boron isotopes (delta B-11)
   on a long-lived coralline alga that grew continuously through the 20th
   century. Analyses focused on four multiannual growth segments. We show a
   long-term decline of 0.08 +/- 0.01 pH units between the end of the 19th
   and 20th century, which is consistent with atmospheric CO2 records.
   Additionally, a strong seasonal cycle (similar to 0.22 pH units) is
   observed and interpreted as episodic annual pH increases caused by the
   consumption of CO2 during strong algal (kelp) growth in spring and
   summer. The rate of acidification intensifies from -0.006 +/- 0.007 pH
   units per decade (between 1920s and 1960s) to -0.019 +/- 0.009 pH units
   per decade (between 1960s and 1990s), and the episodic pH increases show
   a continuous shift to earlier times of the year throughout the
   centennial record. This is indicative of ecosystem shifts in shallow
   water algal productivity in this high-latitude habitat resulting from
   warming and acidification.},

   temperature sensing (RDTS) for oil leakage detection in soil. The
   capability of the distributed Raman sensor in detecting and locating,

   paper by reporting lab experiments demonstrating accurate meter scale
   temperature measurement over more than 50 km of standard single mode
   fiber. The proposed solution, based on distributed Simplex coding
   techniques, can be competitive in terms of cost and performance with
   respect to other distributed sensing technologies.},

Abstract = {European surface temperatures have increased during the past decades.
   According to climate projections, this warming is expected to continue
   in future years under enhanced radiative forcings. In addition to the
   mean increase, changes in temperature variability are likely to occur,
   with more frequent extreme seasons such as those recently observed in
   the past decade (e.g. summer 2003, autumn 2006). Yet, most of the
   processes driving such long-term tendencies remain unidentified and
   unexplored. A particularly important issue is how changes in the
   atmospheric dynamics over the North-Atlantic and Europe (NAE) contribute
   to trends in both mean and extreme temperatures. The high occurrence of
   the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in the
   1980s-1990s suggested that the European warming could result from a
   re-organization in the main structures of the NAE dynamics. However, the
   2000s have rather revealed an inconsistency between atmospheric
   circulation conditions and European temperatures. Here we investigate
   the relationship between sea-level pressure (SLP) and 2-m temperature
   (T2m) using a flow-analogues method applied over both observations and
   future projections. We use 13 models of the Third phase of the Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) over 1961-2000, 2046-2065 and
   2081-2100, from which we extract seasonal subensembles with respect to
   their representation of observed SLP-T2m seasonal relationships. First
   we show that the distribution of SLP does not undergo major changes in
   future climate according to these seasonal model-ensembles, albeit a
   general decline of the variability is observed for all seasons. Then,
   using the flow-analogues, we conclude that the projected European
   warming appears disconnected from changes in the NAE dynamics. Only in
   winter a slight shift towards positive NAO conditions could partially
   contribute to the future temperature increase. Finally, a focus over
   unusually warm/cold seasons reveals that future temperature extremes
   should likely to be associated with similar atmospheric circulations as
   observed during recent ones.},

Abstract = {Coastal warming was analyzed by means of satellite-derived sea surface
   temperature ( SST) along the continental part of the Atlantic Arc
   extending from 37 degrees N to 48 degrees N for the period 1985-2005.
   Interannual SST variability calculated from anomalies shows an
   inhomogeneous warming trend in coastal SST ( Delta SST). Coastal warming
   trend ranges from 3.5 degrees C 100 a(-1) at latitudes close to 48
   degrees N to 1.2 degrees C 100 a(-1) at latitudes close to 37 degrees N.
   This warming is observed to reflect oceanic DSST which increases
   northward in the Atlantic area. In addition, a westward increase was
   also observed across the North Atlantic. Coastal warming is not constant
   all year long. It only occurs during spring and summer in the entire
   area under scope, following a trend similar to the annual one. The mean
   spring DSST values are 5.1 degrees C 100 a(-1) in the French coast, 4.4
   degrees C 100 a(-1) in the Cantabrian coast, and 3.8 degrees C 100 a(-1)
   in the western Iberian Peninsula coast. Similar values ( 5.0 degrees C
   100 a(-1), 3.7 degrees C 100 a(-1), and 2.7 degrees C 100 a(-1)) are
   observed in summer.},

Abstract = {The Caspian Sea - Hindu Kush Index (CasHKI) has been introduced as an
   indicator of modulation of the wind regime and dust activity over
   southwest (SW) Asia. This study analyzes the long-term series in CasHKI
   values and the associated mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) anomalies over
   the Caspian Sea (CS) and Hindu Kush (HK) domains during the period
   1963-2014, aiming at examining the trends in CasHKI and the associated
   climate implications. An overall negative trend (-0.12 hPa per decade)
   in CasHKI is revealed during 1963-2014, mostly driven by the large
   decrease in CasHKI during 1963-1980, whereas an increasing trend is
   found during the 2000s. The CasHKI values are mostly related to the MSLP
   anomalies over the CS rather than HK domain; however, the negative
   anomalies in MSLP over HK during the 1960s determine the corresponding
   CasHKI trends. The MSLP values and anomalies show a regional shift in
   the core maximum and higher increasing trends at the southern compared
   to northern latitudes within the CS domain. The synoptic maps of the
   MSLP, geopotential height at 700 hPa (Z700) and vertical profile of the
   meridional wind are compared between the months with highest and lowest
   CasHKI values, revealing a significant intensification in the north wind
   over the SW Asia and a deepening of the Indian/Pakistan thermal low for
   the high-CasHKI months in summer. In addition, the high-CasHKI months
   are mostly associated with a decrease in Z700 over SW Asia and the
   Middle East, an intensification of the Indian monsoon trough, a decrease
   in temperature over the SW Asia and a slight increase in rainfall over
   parts of SW Asia, Middle East and east Africa. Finally, ENSO variability
   seems not to be significantly linked with CasHKI - but this issue
   requires further examination.},

Abstract = {With the effects of climate change prevailing worldwide, it is essential
   to understand the long-term rainfall and temperature trends at regional
   scales to plan for adaptation strategies. Investigating the temporal
   dynamics of meteorological variables in climate-induced changes,
   particularly in rain-fed agriculture countries such as India, is
   needful. The present study focused on the temporal variation of rainfall
   and temperature trends to analyse the drought characteristics over the
   past 20 years (2001-2020) using ground-based Automatic Weather Station
   (AWS) data at a semi-arid station Anantapur in southern peninsular
   India. The seasonal maximum mean temperature (T-mean) was observed in
   summer (32.20 +/- 1.36 degrees C), followed by the monsoon (29.08 +/-
   1.02 degrees C), postmonsoon (26.45 +/- 2.44 degrees C), and winter
   (25.45 +/- 1.01 degrees C) during the study period. The Mann-Kendall
   trend test result showed the decreasing trend in seasonal mean
   temperature during the drying period (winter {[}-0.069 degrees C center
   dot year(-1)] and summer {[}-0.081 degrees C center dot year(-1)]) and
   increasing trend in the wetting period (monsoon {[}0.012 degrees C
   center dot year(-1)] and postmonsoon {[}0.034 degrees C center dot
   year(-1)]). On the other hand, the seasonal rainfall decreases in the
   postmonsoon (-2.276 mm center dot year(-1)) while increasing in winter
   (0.5 mm center dot year(-1)), summer (2.137 mm center dot year(-1)), and
   monsoon (6.901 mm center dot year(-1)) seasons. The annual trends of
   minimum, maximum, and mean monthly temperatures decrease at the rate of
   -0.121, -0.123, and -0.022 degrees C center dot year(-1), respectively,
   while the rainfall increases at the rate of 8.979 mm center dot
   year(-1). Furthermore, the temporal evolution of meteorological drought
   characteristics was estimated with the help of the standardized
   precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation
   evapotranspiration index (SPEI) on multiple timescales ranging from 1 to
   24 months on a monthly basis during the study period. The 24-month SPI
   values showed that 1 ``severely dry{''} and the 29 ``moderately dry{''}
   long-term drought events were observed. From 24-month SPEI, a total of
   15 ``severely dry{''} and 20 ``moderately dry{''} long-term droughts
   were observed during the study period. The severely dry years were
   observed in 2002 and 2003, while the wettest periods were 2007 and 2010.
   Both indices are identified as more severe dry periods from 2002 to 2006
   and 2013 to 2017 than rest periods. Also, a significant decreasing
   tendency of droughts was observed in both indices. The SPI values are
   compared with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) and found that the SPI versus ENSO
   index negatively correlates with the coefficient of -0.58 significantly,
   while the SPI versus NDVI correlation is insignificant. The study region
   converted to wetter conditions during the last 20 years.},

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},

Abstract = {The near-surface air temperature lapse rate (SATLR) is a result of
   surface energy balance, and the long-term trend of SATLR is linked to
   elevation-dependent warming (EDW). The long-term trend of SATLR in
   China's mainland was examined in the present study. It was found that
   the regional average values of annual, autumn, and winter SATLR
   anomalies in Tmean, Tmax, and Tmin decreased significantly during the
   period of 1961-2018. In terms of spatial distribution, most of the
   annual SATLR trends in Tmean across China's mainland are negative. In
   spring, positive SATLR trends in Tmean are widespread in the northern
   mountainous areas of China, while in winter, strong negative trends are
   found in some areas of the central and eastern parts of the Tibetan
   Plateau and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Most of the negative annual
   SATLR trends in Tmax occur in the central part of China, but in the
   southwestern part of China for Tmin. Widespread negative SATLR trends in
   Tmin are usually found in winter, especially in the Hengduan Mountains
   of Southwestern China and the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. The
   significant positive SATLR trends in Tmax are observed in spring, mostly
   distributed in northern mountainous areas. In the context of global and
   regional warming, the long-term trend of SATLR has the potential to
   detect differences in altitude responses to climate change on a small
   spatial scale, and to explore the local effect of EDW.},

Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {35},
Number = {11},

Abstract = {In this paper, the interdecadal variability of upper-ocean temperature
   in the South China Sea (SCS) is investigated based on several
   objectively analyzed data sets and two reanalysis data sets. The trends
   of the SCS sea surface temperature (SST) have changed from warming to
   cooling since the late 1990s. A heat budget analysis suggests that the
   warming of the surface mixed layer during 1984-1999 is primarily
   attributed to the horizontal heat advection and the decrease of upward
   long wave radiation, with the net surface heat flux playing a damping
   role due to the increase of upward latent and sensible heat fluxes. On
   the other hand, the cooling of the surface mixed layer during 2000-2009
   is broadly controlled by net surface heat flux, with the radiation flux
   playing the dominant role. A possible mechanism is explored that the
   variation of a sea level pressure (SLP) over the North Pacific Ocean may
   change the prevailing winds over the SCS, which contributes to the
   change of the SST in the SCS through the horizontal heat advection and
   heat fluxes.},

Title = {Time Trends and Predictors of Abnormal Postoperative Body Temperature in
   Infants Transported to the Intensive Care Unit},
Journal = {ANESTHESIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Background. Despite increasing adoption of active warming methods over
   the recent years, little is known about the effectiveness of these
   interventions on the occurrence of abnormal postoperative temperatures
   in sick infants. Methods. Preoperative and postoperative temperature
   readings, patient characteristics, and procedural factors of critically
   ill infants at a single institution were retrieved retrospectively from
   June 2006 until May 2014. The primary endpoints were the incidence and
   trend of postoperative hypothermia and hyperthermia on arrival at the
   intensive care units. Univariate and adjusted analyses were performed to
   identify factors independently associated with abnormal postoperative
   temperatures. Results. 2,350 cases were included. 82\% were normothermic
   postoperatively, while hypothermia and hyperthermia each occurred in 9\%
   of cases. During the study period, hypothermia decreased from 24\% to
   2\% (p < 0.0001) while hyperthermia remained unchanged (13\% in 2006,
   8\% in 2014, p = 0.357). Factors independently associated with
   hypothermia were higher ASA status (p = 0.02), lack of intraoperative
   convective warming (p < 0.001) and procedure date before 2010 (p <
   0.001). Independent associations for postoperative hyperthermia included
   lower body weight (p = 0.01) and procedure date before 2010 (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions. We report an increase in postoperative normothermia rates
   in critically ill infants from 2006 until 2014. Careful monitoring to
   avoid overcorrection and hyperthermia is recommended.},

Title = {The effects of urbanization on temperature trends in different economic

Abstract = {Using data collected from 22 urban and 65 rural meteorological stations
   in northwestern China between 1961 and 2009, this paper presents a study
   concerning the effects of urbanization on air temperature trends. To
   distinguish among the potential influences that stem from the economic
   development levels, population scales, and geographic environments of
   the cities in this region, the 49-year study period was divided into two
   periods: a period of less economic development, from 1961 to 1978, and a
   period of greater economic development, from 1979 to 2009. Each of the
   cities was classified as a megalopolis, large, or medium-small,
   depending on the population, and each was classified as a plateau,
   plain, or oasis city, depending on the surrounding geography. The
   differences in the air temperature trends between cities and the average
   of their rural counterparts were used to examine the warming effects of
   urbanization. The results of this study indicate that the magnitude of
   warming effects due to urbanization depends not only on a city's
   economic level, but also on the population scale and geographic
   environment of the city. The urbanization of most cities in northwestern
   China resulted in considerable negative warming effects during 1961-1978
   but evidently positive effects during 1979-2009. The population scale of
   a city represents a significant factor: a city with a larger population
   has a stronger warming influence, regardless of whether the effect is
   negative or positive. Among the three geographic environments of the
   cities considered, plateaus and plains more significantly enhance
   warming effects than oases. The urban population trend has a very
   significant logarithm relationship with the urban temperature effect,
   but no clear relationships between urban temperature effects and city
   elevation were detected. The majority of the temperature trends,
   accounting for more than 60 \% of the trends during 1961-2009, can be
   explained by natural factors, although urbanization has had some obvious
   effects on temperatures in northwestern China.},

Title = {Temperature trends derived from Stratospheric Sounding Unit radiances::
   The effect of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> on the weighting function},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},

Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Stratospheric Sounding Units (SSU) on the NOAA operational satellites
   have been the main source of near-global temperature trend data above
   the lower stratosphere. They have been used extensively for comparison
   with model- derived trends. The SSU senses in the 15 mm band of CO2 and
   hence the weighting function is sensitive to changes in CO2
   concentrations. The impact of this change in weighting function has been
   ignored in all recent trend analyses. We show that the apparent trends
   in global-mean brightness temperature due to the change in weighting
   function vary from about -0.4 Kdecade(-1) to 0.4 Kdecade(-1), depending
   on the altitude sensed by the different SSU channels. For some channels,
   this apparent trend is of a similar size to the trend deduced from SSU
   data but ignoring the change in weighting function. In the
   mid-stratosphere, the revised trends are now significantly more negative
   and in better agreement with model-calculated trends.},

Title = {Modelled wheat phenology captures rising temperature trends: Shortened
   time to flowering and maturity in Australia and Argentina},
Journal = {FIELD CROPS RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {99},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {136-146},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Phenological development is the most important attribute of crop
   adaptation and long-term changes in phenology provide strong evidence of
   the biological impact of warmer climates. This paper takes the
   documented increase in temperature during the last decades as a starting
   point, and quantifies the changes in wheat phenology in (a) 53 locations
   in eastern Australia between 1957 and 2000 using the APSIM model, and
   (b) 17 locations in the Pampas between 1971 and 2000, using CERES-Wheat.
   The expectation is shortened season length associated with warmer
   climate; the aim is to quantify the actual magnitude of phenological
   changes, the relative changes in the duration of pre- and post-flowering
   phases, and the interaction between changing temperature and sowing
   date.
   Modelled time from sowing to maturity was reduced up to similar to 0.3 d
   y(-1); time to flowering accounted for most of the variation in time to
   maturity. The rate of change in the duration of modelled wheat
   phenophases was more marked with early sowing. Owing to the cumulative
   effect of temperature on crop development assumed in the models,
   significant changes in rate of development were detected in some cases
   when change in temperature was statistically undetected. A minimum rate
   of mean temperature increase similar to 0.02 degrees C y(-1) was
   required for significant shortening of time to flowering and season
   length. In agreement with rates derived from field experiments, the rate
   of change in modelled time to flowering and maturity was approximate to
   7 d degrees C-1. The duration of the post-flowering phase was largely
   unchanged. This was associated with lack of change in temperature, or
   where temperature increased, earlier flowering that shifted
   post-flowering development to relatively cooler conditions, thus
   neutralising the trend of increasing temperature. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {MOLECULAR ECOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Rapid increases in global temperature are likely to impose strong
   directional selection on many plant populations, which must therefore
   adapt if they are to survive. Within populations, microgeographic
   genetic differentiation of individuals with respect to climate suggests
   that some populations may adapt to changing temperatures in the
   short-term through rapid changes in gene frequency. We used a genome
   scan to identify temperature-related adaptive differentiation of
   individuals of the tree species Fagus sylvatica. By combining molecular
   marker and dendrochronological data we assessed spatial and temporal
   variation in gene frequency at the locus identified as being under
   selection. We show that gene frequency at this locus varies predictably
   with temperature. The probability of the presence of the dominant marker
   allele shows a declining trend over the latter half of the 20th century,
   in parallel with rising temperatures in the region. Our results show
   that F. sylvatica populations may show some capacity for an in situ
   adaptive response to climate change. However as reported ongoing
   distributional changes demonstrate, this response is not enough to allow
   all populations of this species to persist in all of their current
   locations.},

Abstract = {Reanalysis data are widely used to investigate long-term surface
   temperature changes due to insufficient spatial coverage of
   observational data. However, because of the limitations of data
   assimilation and model performance in the reanalysis datasets, it is
   essential to evaluate the quality of the reanalysis datasets. Based on
   the newly released version of China global Merged Surface Temperature
   dataset, Interim version (CMST-Interim), the performance of five
   reanalysis datasets (ERA5, NCEP/NCAR R1, JRA-55, CERA-20C, and 20CRv3),
   covering more than 50 years, is compared in terms of long-term variation
   bias, warming trend, and the consistency of the extreme temperature
   years from the period 1958-2010. The results reflect that the above
   reanalysis datasets have reasonable representativeness of global
   temperature change. ERA5 and 20CRv3 perform better than the other
   reanalysis datasets, with relatively small deviation, their warming
   trends are closer to the observation results, the appearance of extreme
   temperature years are also more consistent with the observed, and
   CERA-20C is the next. JRA-55 is slightly better in detecting the
   extremely cold years, while NCEP/NCAR R1 is slightly worse in biases but
   performs well in high-temperature years reproduction.},

Abstract = {The Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) profoundly affects human health,
   agriculture, eco-system, and socioeconomic systems. In this study, we
   analyzed past and future changes in DTR using gridded Climate Research
   Unit (CRU) datasets for the years 1950-2020 and an ensemble means of
   thirteen bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6
   (CMIP6) models under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6,
   SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) scenarios for the rest of the 21st century over
   the southern slope of Central Himalaya, Nepal. Furthermore, the
   potential drivers (precipitation and cloud cover) of seasonal and annual
   DTR were studied using correlation analysis. This study found that the
   DTR trends generally declined; the highest decrease was observed in the
   pre-monsoon and winter at a rate of 0.09 degrees C/decade (p <= 0.01).
   As expected, DTR demonstrated a significant negative correlation with
   cloudiness and precipitation in all four seasons. Further, the decreased
   DTR was weakly related to the Sea Surface Temperature variation (SST) in
   the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. We found that the projected DTR
   changes in the future varied from a marginal increase under the SSP1-2.6
   (only pre-monsoon) scenario to continued significant decreases under
   SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. Insights based on retrospective and prospective
   evaluation help to understand the long-term evolution of diurnal

Abstract = {Increasing global CO2 and local land use changes coupled with increased
   nutrient pollution are threatening estuaries worldwide. Local changes of
   estuarine chemistry have been documented, but regional associations and
   trends comparing multiple estuaries latitudinally have not been
   evaluated. Rapid climate change has impacted the annual and decadal
   chemical trends in estuaries, with local ecosystem processes enhancing
   or mitigating the responses. Here, we compare pH, dissolved oxygen,
   temperature, and salinity data from 10 Florida shellfish estuaries and
   hundreds of shellfish bed stations. Over 80,000 measurements, spanning
   from 1980 to 2008, taken on Atlantic Ocean and West Florida coast showed
   significant regional trends of consistent pH decreases in 8 out of the
   10 estuaries, with an average rate of decrease on the Gulf of Mexico
   side estuaries of Florida of 7.3 x 10(-4) pH units year(-1), and average
   decrease on the Atlantic Coast estuaries of 5.0 x 10(-4) pH units
   year(-1). The rates are approximately 2-3.4 times slower than observed
   in pH decreases associated with ocean acidification in the Atlantic and
   Pacific. Other significant trends observed include decreasing dissolved
   oxygen in 9 out of the 10 estuaries, increasing salinity in 6 out of the
   10, and temperature increases in 3 out of the 10 estuaries. The data
   provide a synoptic regional view of Florida estuary trends which reflect
   the complexity of changing climate and coastal ocean acidification
   superimposed on local conditions. These data provide context for
   understanding, and interpreting the past and predicting future of
   regional water quality health of shellfish and other organisms of
   commercial and ecological significance along Florida's coasts.},

Abstract = {Long-term trends in soil temperature are important, but rarely reported,
   as a sensitive climate indicator and its impact on biological, chemical,
   and physical processes that occur in the soil. In this study, the simple
   linear regression and nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test were
   employed to identify trends in monthly air and soil temperature
   anomalies (ATA and STA, respectively) time series at 5-100 cm depths of
   a soil profile, based on long-term (1987-2016) observation data of
   meteorological station of Bajgah Agricultural Experimental station,
   located in a semi-arid region in Iran. The results indicated a
   significant warming trend in ATA for February-October, with the highest
   and lowest rate of warming in March (0.103 degrees C year(-1)) and
   December (-0.001 degrees C year(-1)), respectively. This study further
   revealed a general and strong increase in monthly means of STA over the
   studied period. The rates of soil temperature warming trend were 2-3
   times greater than those of air temperature. The greatest soil warming
   increases with the rates of 0.20 and 0.19 degrees C year(-1) were,
   respectively, observed at 5 and 10 cm soil depths in July. The applied
   linear trend indicated that the STA at 10 and 30 cm depths have warmed
   during May-October. In addition, the MK test revealed a significant
   trend in STA at 10 cm depth in March. Such significant warming trends in
   subsurface soil depths including 50 and 100 cm were observed for
   June-December during the whole period.},

Title = {Analysis of the impacts of station exposure on the US Historical
   Climatology Network temperatures and temperature trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},

Volume = {116},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {The recently concluded Surface Stations Project surveyed 82.5\% of the
   U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) stations and provided a
   classification based on exposure conditions of each surveyed station,
   using a rating system employed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration to develop the U.S. Climate Reference Network. The unique
   opportunity offered by this completed survey permits an examination of
   the relationship between USHCN station siting characteristics and
   temperature trends at national and regional scales and on differences
   between USHCN temperatures and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR)
   temperatures. This initial study examines temperature differences among
   different levels of siting quality without controlling for other factors
   such as instrument type. Temperature trend estimates vary according to
   site classification, with poor siting leading to an overestimate of
   minimum temperature trends and an underestimate of maximum temperature
   trends, resulting in particular in a substantial difference in estimates
   of the diurnal temperature range trends. The opposite-signed differences
   of maximum and minimum temperature trends are similar in magnitude, so
   that the overall mean temperature trends are nearly identical across
   site classifications. Homogeneity adjustments tend to reduce trend
   differences, but statistically significant differences remain for all
   but average temperature trends. Comparison of observed temperatures with
   NARR shows that the most poorly sited stations are warmer compared to
   NARR than are other stations, and a major portion of this bias is
   associated with the siting classification rather than the geographical
   distribution of stations. According to the best-sited stations, the
   diurnal temperature range in the lower 48 states has no century-scale
   trend.},

Abstract = {A simple regression model relating local monthly mean diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) and cloudiness at 10 synoptic stations in the
   Nordic region to monthly mean large-scale tropospheric flow has been
   constructed. The tropospheric how data, which is input to the model,
   includes both 500 hPa height and 500/1000 hPa thickness fields which are
   compressed via an EOF-technique. The regression coefficients are
   calculated from a 27 year record of analysed flow and locally observed
   DTR and cloudiness.
   The regression model has been used to down-scale the large-scale flow
   produced in a CO2 sensitivity experiment with a coupled ocean-atmosphere
   climate model (ECHAM-1). The down-scaled `'high CO2'' DTR is generally
   smaller than found when down-scaling the corresponding climate model
   control experiment. The opposite statement applies to cloudiness.
   DTR-anomalies of the order 2 Kelvin (K) are obtained in the
   central/northern parts of Fenno-Scandia in the middle of the 21st
   century while anomalies much closer to zero are found over the
   Iceland/Southern Greenland region. Consistent with this picture the
   cloudiness anomalies in the high CO2 case are predicted highest near the
   central/northern parts of Fenno-Scandia.
   The results presented here indicate that periods observed to be
   anomalously warm on a large-scale - corresponding to high CO2
   concentrations - are also observed to be more cloudy and it is argued
   that clouds may have a thermostatic effect.
   We have calculated DTR and cloud cover trends at the 10 stations used in
   the regression model in order to assess if they are consistent with the
   predicted estimates and as such reflect a forcing of the climate system,
   We find that none of the stations show DTR/cloud cover trends
   significantly different from zero in the period 1961-1987. We do,
   however, see a negative DTR trend and a positive cloud trend when we
   consider a slightly longer time series (1950-1992) at Reykjavik. All
   statements about trends are, however, very uncertain because the
   observed records in addition to any trends reflect a large natural
   variability on decadal time scales as well as possible observational
   inhomogeneities.},

   surface temperature data twice a day since 2002. The data products were
   first processed to obtain the average daily temperature over the lakes
   and their surrounding land areas from July 2002 to May 2018. A
   statistical approach was applied to calculate the temperature trends of
   the lake water, the surrounding land. Moreover, the relationship between
   the LST trends and potential driving factors such as the land cover
   changes in the lakes' basins, lakes areas, depth, and latitude were
   investigated. The primary results show that lakes water temperature are
   warming faster than the surrounding land temperature. Furthermore,
   67.54\% of lakes are shrinking while 24.92\% are growing.},

Abstract = {Trend identification plays a significant role in climate change studies
   to make future predictions about possible consequences on the urban
   environment, agriculture, water availability, etc. The Variation of
   Extreme Temperature intensity is observed in many regions all over the
   globe as an outcome of abrupt changes in climate. Keeping in mind the
   non-stationary climate conditions, it is essential to incorporate
   potential future changes in climatological studies. In the present
   study, the statistical parameters and the variability in time series of
   extreme daily temperature were analyzed using Generalized Extreme Value
   (GEV) distribution and its suitability has been examined by
   superimposing onto Gringorten plotting positions. The trend analysis of
   extreme daily temperatures was carried out using an innovative trend
   template proposed by Sen {[}7] and non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK)
   trend test. The trend detection and variability of extreme daily
   temperature of Abu Dhabi City station, UAE was also carried out in this
   study. 34 years of temperature data were used for the analysis. Also,
   the extreme daily temperatures time series were checked for their serial
   correlation.},

Abstract = {Historical trends in the tropical Pacific zonal sea surface temperature
   gradient (SST gradient) are analyzed herein using 41 climate models (83
   simulations) and 5 observational data sets. A linear inverse model is
   trained on each simulation and observational data set to assess if
   trends in the SST gradient are significant relative to the stationary
   statistics of internal variability, as would suggest an important role
   for external forcings such as anthropogenic greenhouse gasses. None of
   the 83 simulations have a positive trend in the SST gradient, a
   strengthening of the climatological SST gradient with more warming in
   the western than eastern tropical Pacific, as large as the mean trend
   across the five observational data sets. If the observed trends are
   anthropogenically forced, this discrepancy suggests that
   state-of-the-art climate models are not capturing the observed response
   of the tropical Pacific to anthropogenic forcing, with serious
   implications for confidence in future climate projections. There are
   caveats to this interpretation, however, as some climate models have a
   significant strengthening of the SST gradient between 1900 and 2013
   Common Era, though smaller in magnitude than the observational data
   sets, and the strengthening in three out of five observational data sets
   is insignificant. When combined with observational uncertainties and the
   possibility of centennial time scale internal variability not sampled by
   the linear inverse model, this suggests that confident validation of
   anthropogenic SST gradient trends in climate models will require further
   emergence of anthropogenic trends. Regardless, the differences in SST
   gradient trends between climate models and observational data sets are
   concerning and motivate the need for process-level validation of the
   atmosphere-ocean dynamics relevant to climate change in the tropical
   Pacific.},

Abstract = {Over the past 18,000 years, sea surface temperatures for the Southern
   Ocean do not align with those of the adjacent, high-latitude landmasses.
   During the late glacial period, the ocean surface warmed rapidly to
   present-day temperatures(1), whereas the land warmed only slowly, as
   evidenced by the lagged response of forest and glaciers(2,3). However,
   in the Holocene epoch, land-based records suggest strong warming whereas
   marine records indicate that ocean surface temperatures cooled. Here we
   present reconstructions of summer temperature for Campbell Island, in
   the Southern Ocean, over the past 16,500 years based on fossil pollen.
   We find a pronounced warming 12,500-11,000 years ago, a cooling until
   9,200 years ago, and a rapid warming to a peak between 6,000 and 5,000
   years ago, followed by minor cool intervals from 5,200-4,000,
   3,000-1,700 and 700-100 years ago. As expected, our temperature
   reconstructions show a late glacial lag behind nearby records of sea
   surface temperature(6,7), and opposing trends in the Holocene. We
   suggest that this discrepancy arises because land-based reconstructions
   record summer temperatures, whereas marine proxies generally reflect
   annual temperatures. We conclude that the divergence of the records
   therefore reflects changes in the seasonality of atmospheric heat
   transport. As atmospheric heat transport is tied to the Southern
   Hemisphere westerly winds, we attribute our observed changes to shifts
   in the position and intensity of the southern westerlies.},

Abstract = {Epilimnetic temperatures from early 1980s through 2017 were analyzed for
   12 Wisconsin (USA), German, and Finnish lakes. Seasonal temperature
   metrics exhibited large interannual variability with trends differing
   among regions. In the Wisconsin lakes, only late summer and fall
   temperatures increased significantly. In the 2 northeastern German
   lakes, temperatures increased in all seasons (not all significantly).
   The 3 Finnish lakes exhibited large spring temperature increases
   influenced by earlier ice-out; summer and fall temperatures also
   increased except for Konnevesi (central Finland) in early summer and
   polar Kevoj?rvi in midsummer. Kevoj?rvi also exhibited no increase in
   maximum recorded temperatures. Earlier records from 4 lakes were
   analyzed to elucidate longer-term epilimnetic temperature patterns. For
   Lake Mendota (southern Wisconsin), spring and late fall temperatures
   have increased modestly but significantly since 1894; summer
   temperatures have also increased modestly because of higher frequency of
   warm temperatures in recent summers and not from new record high
   temperatures. Trout Lake (northern Wisconsin) exhibited warm
   temperatures in some summers during the 1930s?1940s, similar to warm
   temperatures in some recent summers. Air?water temperature relationships
   coupled with long-term regional air temperature data also indicated
   summer epilimnetic temperatures in the study lakes were likely as warm
   in the 1930s?1940s as in recent years. Lake data confirmed cooler
   epilimnetic temperatures occurred in many summers during the 1950s?1980s
   coincident with cooler air temperatures. Because epilimnetic
   temperatures have not increased monotonically since 1900, our study
   supports continued temperature monitoring in lakes with extensive
   historical data to better understand and predict future effects of
   climate change on lake ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The comparison of trends in various climate indices in observations and
   models is of fundamental importance for judging the credibility of
   climate projections. Tropical tropospheric temperature trends have
   attracted particular attention as this comparison may suggest a model
   deficiency. One can think of this problem as composed of two parts: one
   focused on tropical surface temperature trends and the associated issues
   related to forcing, feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake and a second part
   focusing on connections between surface and tropospheric temperatures
   and the vertical profile of trends in temperature. Here we focus on the
   atmospheric component of the problem. We show that two ensembles of
   Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory HiRAM model runs (similar results
   are shown for National Center for Atmospheric Research's CAM4 model)
   with different commonly used prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs),
   namely, the HadISST1 and ``Hurrell{''} data sets, have a difference in
   upper tropical tropospheric temperature trends (similar to 0.1 K/decade
   at 300 hPa for the period 1984-2008) that is about a factor 3 larger
   than expected from moist adiabatic scaling of the tropical average SST
   trend difference. We show that this surprisingly large discrepancy in
   temperature trends is a consequence of SST trend differences being
   largest in regions of deep convection. Further, trends, and the degree
   of agreement with observations, not only depend on SST data set and the
   particular atmospheric temperature data set but also on the period
   chosen for comparison. Due to the large impact on atmospheric
   temperatures, these systematic uncertainties in SSTs need to be resolved
   before the fidelity of climate models' tropical temperature trend
   profiles can be assessed.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to determine the mean temperature trends in the
   south-southeast region of Mexico during the historical period of
   1980-2014, as well as during the future periods of 2021-2040, 2041-2060,
   and 2081-2100, as recommended by the IPCC. Additionally, the study
   sought to identify the climate change scenario that is most closely
   aligned with the socio-environmental conditions of the south-southeast
   zone of Mexico and that has the greatest impact on the region's average
   temperature. The downscaling method of bias correction was conducted at
   a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees, and an analysis of
   historical trends was performed for the period 1980-2014 with ERA5 and
   four CMIP6 models (CNRM-ESM2-1, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC6, and MRI-ESM2-0).
   This process was extended to future projections. The models indicated
   temperature differences of less than 0.5 degrees C with respect to ERA5,
   in agreement with other studies. Additionally, the current study
   calculated future trends for the south-southeast region using three of
   the CMIP6 scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP4-6.0, and SSP5-8.5). The z-eq
   proposal was used to compare the slopes, enabling us to determine which
   of the three scenarios corresponded to the historical trend, assuming
   identical socio-environmental conditions. The SSP4-6.0 scenario was
   found to correspond to the historical trend.},

   (2011-2100) maximum temperature (T (max)) and minimum temperature
   (T-min) time series were generated using the statistical downscaling
   technique for low emission scenario (RCP2.6), moderate emission scenario
   (RCP6.0), and extreme emission scenario (RCP8.5). Trends and change of
   magnitude in T (max), T (min), and diurnal temperature range (DTR) were
   analyzed for different interdecadal time scales (2011-2100, 2011-2040,
   2041-2070, 2070-2100) using Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and Sen's
   slope estimator, respectively. The temperature data series for the
   observed duration (1981-2000) has been found to show increasing trends
   in T (max) and T (min) at both annual and monthly scale. Trend analysis
   of downscaled temperature for the period 2011-2100 shows increase in
   annual maximum temperature and annual minimum temperature for all the
   selected RCP scenarios; however, on the monthly scale, T (max) and T
   (min) have been seen to have decreasing trends in some months.},

Abstract = {In order to detect daily temperature trend in eastern China, observed
   daily temperature data spanning over 32 years (1979-2010) including
   daily maximum temperature (T-max), minimum temperature (T-min) and mean

   grassland/cropland around 102 meteorological stations were also
   investigated to explore the sensitivity of temperature to
   grassland/cropland. Increasing trends were detected in observed T-max
   and T-min, with distinct connection to the distribution of
   grassland/cropland. T-max changed greatly in grassland and T-min in
   cropland. Besides, unique seasonal and spatial variability was
   discovered in T-max and T-min, respectively. Finally, percentile-based
   temperature indices derived from observed daily temperature data were
   further involved to demonstrate the sensitivity of temperature extremes
   to grassland/cropland, which showed that the annual occurrences of warm
   day, summer heat wave and winter warm night events were increasing,
   while those of cold night were decreasing. Analysis of thresholds that
   distinguished summer heat wave and winter warm night events suggested
   higher temperature in grassland.},

Abstract = {Quantitative reconstructions of atmospheric CO2 by using terrestrial and
   marine records are critical for understanding the so-called
   ``greenhouse{''} conditions in the Cretaceous, but data from terrestrial
   plants for several stages of this period remain quite limited. Using the
   stomatal index (SI) technique, here we estimate the Santonian (Late
   Cretaceous) CO2 contents based on a sequence of fossil cuticles of
   Ginkgo adiantoides (Ung.) Heer from three beds of the Yong'ancun
   Formation in Jiayin, Heilongjiang Province, northeastern China. By the
   regress function, SIs of Ginkgo fossils reveal a pronounced CO2
   reduction from the early to late Santonian (similar to 661 and similar
   to 565 ppm, respectively). The relatively high CO2 levels provide
   additional evidence for paleoclimatic warmth in this interval. Moreover,
   available paleobotanical data illustrate a decline trend of CO2 contents
   throughout the Late Cretaceous, punctuated by several fluctuations in
   particular episodes with different magnitudes. The CO2 contents shifted
   notably in the late Cenomanian, Turonian, early Santonian, late
   Campanian, and probably latest Maastrichtian. Furthermore, a
   comprehensive study based on CO2 data shows that the global mean land
   surface temperature (GMLST) fluctuated several times accordingly. The
   change ratios of GMLST (Delta T) increased from similar to 3A degrees C
   in late Cenomanian to similar to 4.7A degrees C in mid Turonian, and
   then dramatically reduced to similar to 2.2A degrees C in mid Coniacian.
   From the Santonian onward, it appears that the temperature gradually
   decreased with a few minor fluctuations.},

Title = {Data-Driven Analysis of Climate Change in Saudi Arabia: Trends in

Abstract = {We have analyzed the long-term temperature trends and extreme
   temperature events in Saudi Arabia between 1979 and 2019. Our study
   relies on high-resolution, consistent, and complete ERA5 reanalysis data
   from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We
   evaluated linear trends in several climate descriptors, including
   temperature, dewpoint temperature, thermal comfort, and extreme event
   indices. Previous works on this topic used data from weather station
   observations over limited time intervals and did not include temperature
   data for recent years. The years 2010-19 have been the warmest decade
   ever observed by instrumental temperature monitoring and are the eight
   warmest years on record. Therefore, the earlier results may be
   incomplete, and their results may no longer be relevant. Our findings
   indicate that, over the past four decades, Saudi Arabia has warmed up at
   a rate that is 50\% higher than the rest of the landmass in the Northern
   Hemisphere. Moreover, moisture content of the air has significantly
   increased in the region. The increases of temperature and humidity have
   resulted in the soaring of dewpoint temperature and thermal discomfort
   across the country. These increases are more substantial during summers,
   which are already very hot relative to winters. Such changes may be
   dangerous to people over vast areas of the country. If the current trend
   persists into the future, human survival in the region will be
   impossible without continuous access to air conditioning.},

Title = {Phenological trends of winter wheat in response to varietal and

Abstract = {Understanding the confounding impacts of climatic and varietal changes
   on crop phenology is of importance to help make appropriate adaptation
   measures and target future directions for crop breeding. This paper
   investigated the changes in winter wheat phenology and analysed the
   impact of climatic, varietal and sowing date changes on crop phenology
   during the last three decades by combining field data with modeling. The
   APSIM crop model was used to quantify the changes in wheat phenology in
   terms of vernalization and photoperiod sensitivity as well as the
   changes in thermal time of pre- and post-flowering stage among wheat
   varieties at six sites in the North China Plain (NCP). The results
   showed that APSIM model could capture the phenological changes of winter
   wheat caused by interannual climatic change. There was a large spatial
   difference in the response pattern of wheat phenology to climatic, and
   varietal changes across NCP. At most sites the increase in temperature
   shortened the growth duration of winter wheat mainly by shortening the
   growth period from sowing to jointing. The delayed sowing of winter
   wheat further shortened the growth period from sowing to jointing at two
   northern sites (Tianjin and Huimin). Continuous adoption of new wheat
   varieties shortened the growth period from sowing to jointing at Huimin,
   Xinxiang and Zhumadian, from jointing to flowering at Tianjin, but
   helped increase the length of growth period from jointing to flowering
   at Huimin, Tangyin and Xinxiang and post-flowering growth period at all
   the sites except for Tangyin. The findings of the study suggest that
   past cultivar changes in wheat in the NCP have been varied
   geographically. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {IPCC AR6 states that the neglect of recent rapid warming in the Arctic
   generally leads to an underestimate of global warming trends. In this
   study, by reconstructing the surface temperature (ST) datasets in the
   Arctic under different sea ice extent scenarios (Imax and Imin), we
   respectively evaluated the annual and seasonal warming trends and their
   uncertainties from 1900 to 2020. The results show that the reconstructed
   datasets have a good representation of the ST change trends in the
   Arctic. In 1900-2020, the annual warming trends in the Arctic (0.17 \&
   PLUSMN; 0.031 and 0.14 \& PLUSMN; 0.025 \& DEG;C per decade under the
   Imax and Imin reconstruction, respectively) are roughly 1.6-1.8 times
   the global mean warming trends (0.10 \& PLUSMN; 0.008 and 0.09 \&
   PLUSMN; 0.008 \& DEG;C per decade). While in 1979-2020, the Arctic
   warming trends (0.66 \& PLUSMN; 0.100 and 0.55 \& PLUSMN; 0.080 \& DEG;C
   per decade) increase to 3.1-3.5 times of the global warming trend (0.19
   \& PLUSMN; 0.023 and 0.18 \& PLUSMN; 0.023 \& DEG;C per decade) for Imax
   and Imin, respectively, indicating that the Arctic amplification effect
   has been significantly enhancing in recent decades. Although the
   seasonal warming trends are closely related to cloud feedback
   mechanisms, atmospheric circulation, and ocean circulation, they are not
   sensitive to the different recon-struction scenarios.},

Title = {Climatology and trends of wintertime diurnal temperature range over East
   Asia in CMIP6 models: Evaluation and attribution},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {280},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Based on the 18 realizations of three state-of-the-art climate models
   participated in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6
   (CMIP6), this paper examines the changes in climatology and trends of
   winter diurnal temperature range (DTR) over East Asia in response to
   natural and anthropogenic forcings. In the observation, the climatology
   of DTR during 1979-2014 displays a horizontal tile from southwest to
   northeast over East Asia. In addition, the observed DTR also presents an
   obviously declining trend in recent decades, with the magnitude of
   roughly-0.10 ? decade(-1). The historical all-forcing simulations well
   reproduce the geographical distributions and magnitude of climatology
   and trends of winter DTR over East Asia in 1979-2014. Furthermore, the
   winter DTR exhibits a continuous declining trend from the historical
   scenario to the future SSP245 scenario over East Asia, with the most
   significant declining during the first half of twenty-first century (i.
   e., 2021-2060). Based on the individual forcing experiments, it suggests
   that the greenhouse gases forcing plays a primary role in driving the
   climatology and trends of DTR over East Asia, especially for the SSP245
   scenario. Further analysis indicates that the increasing precipitation
   under greenhouse gases forcing largely explain the declining DTR trends
   over East Asia, especially over the northern East Asia both in
   historical and SSP245 scenarios.},

Abstract = {Concurrent with the background rise in global mean temperatures, changes
   in extreme events are also becoming evident, and are arguably more
   impactful on society. This research examines trends in three components
   of seasonally-relative extreme temperature and humidity events in North
   America that directly influence human thermal comfort: event frequency,
   duration, and areal extent. Results indicate that for the majority of
   the study domain, changes in these events are in the expected direction
   with changes in means. Extreme heat events are generally increasing
   throughout the domain, with the largest changes in summer and autumn in
   the eastern portion of Canada and the United States. Cold events are
   largely decreasing in these same locations and seasons, with additional
   widespread decreases in winter. Interestingly, significant increases in
   cold events are also evident in autumn in parts of the western United
   States. Extreme humidity events are showing an even greater change than
   temperature events - nearly all of Canada and most of the United States
   is seeing significant increases in extreme humid events and decreases in
   dry events, while the southwestern deserts show widespread significant
   increases in dry events, especially in winter and spring. Changes in
   event duration and spatial extent mimic these results. Importantly, this
   research demonstrates that there are regions that show changes to
   extreme events that differ from the overall changes in means,
   highlighting the importance of looking beyond climate averages to
   examine not only extreme events, but changes in higher-order statistical
   moments.},

Title = {Insect temperature-body size trends common to laboratory, latitudinal
   and seasonal gradients are not found across altitudes},
Journal = {FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {948-957},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. Body size affects rates of most biological and ecological processes,
   from individual performance to ecosystem function, and is fundamentally
   linked to organism fitness. Within species, size at maturity can vary
   systematically with environmental temperature in the laboratory and
   across seasons, as well as over latitudinal gradients. Recent
   meta-analyses have revealed a close match in the magnitude and
   -direction of these size gradients in various arthropod orders,
   suggesting that these size responses share common drivers.
   2. As with increasing latitude, temperature also decreases with
   increasing altitude. Although the general direction of body size clines
   along altitudinal gradients has been examined previously, to our
   knowledge altitude-body size (A-S) clines have never been synthesised
   quantitatively, nor compared with temperature-size (T-S) responses
   measured under controlled laboratory conditions.
   3. Here we quantitatively examine variation in intraspecific A-S clines
   among 121 insect species from 50 different global locations,
   representing 12 taxonomic orders. While some taxa were better
   represented in the literature than others, our analysis reveals
   extensive variation in the magnitude and direction of A-S clines.
   Following the assumption that temperature on average declines by 1
   degrees C per 150 m increase in altitude, order-specific A-S clines in
   the field appear to deviate from laboratory T-S responses. Specifically,
   the magnitude of A-S clines and T-S responses are more closely matched
   in some taxonomic orders (e.g. Diptera) than others (e.g. Orthoptera).
   These findings contrast with the strong co-variation observed between
   latitude-size clines and T-S responses, and between laboratory and
   seasonal T-S responses.
   4. The lack of clear size relationships with elevation, and hence
   temperature, is likely due to the counteracting effects of other major
   drivers with altitude, including season length and oxygen partial
   pressure. Switches in voltinism within species across altitude, and the
   dispersal of individuals across different elevations, may also obscure
   trends.},

Title = {Historical Trends in Surface Air Temperature Estimated by Ensemble
   Empirical Mode Decomposition and Least Squares Linear Fitting},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {10-16},
Abstract = {Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and least squares linear
   fitting (LSLF) are applied to estimate the historical trends of surface
   air temperature (SAT) from observations and Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations during the period
   1901-2005. The magnitudes of trends estimated by the two approaches are
   comparable. The trend calculated by the EEMD approach is larger than
   that by the LSLF approach in most (23/27) of the models during
   1901-2005. During the slow warming period, the EEMD trend is smaller
   than the LSLF trend. The rootmean-square errors (RMSEs) between the raw
   and reconstructed times series by the LSLF approach are larger than
   those by the EEMD trend component and multi-decadal variability
   components during 1901-2005 in most of the models and observations.
   During 1901-70 (or 1971-2005), the RMSEs between the raw and
   reconstructed times series by LSLF are larger than those by the EEMD
   trend component. In this sense, the EEMD trend is a better choice to
   obtain the climate trends in observations and CMIP5 models, especially
   for short time periods. This is because the trend estimated by LSLF
   cannot capture the internal variability and the cooling in some years.
   The estimated global warming rates (trend) are consistently larger
   (smaller) than those from observations in 11 of 27 CMIP5 models during
   1901-2005 in the slow and rapid warming periods. This implies these 11
   models have consistent responses to greenhouse gases for any period.},

Title = {Poleward migration of tropical corals inhibited by future trends of
   seawater temperature and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {929},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Poleward range expansion of marine organisms is commonly attributed to
   anthropogenic ocean warming. However, the extent to which a single
   species can migrate poleward remains unclear. In this study, we used
   molecular data to examine the current distribution of the Pocillopora
   damicornis species complex in Taiwan waters and applied niche modeling
   to predict its potential range through the end of the 21st Century. The
   P. damicornis species complex is widespread across shallow, tropical and
   subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific regions. Our results revealed
   that populations from subtropical nonreefal coral communities are P.
   damicornis, whose native geographical ranges are approximately between
   23 degrees N and 35 degrees N. In contrast, those from tropical reefs
   are P. acuta. Our analysis of 50 environmental data layers demonstrated
   that the concentrations of CaCO3 termediate shared socioeconomic
   pathways (SSP) 2-4.5 and very high (SSP5-8.5) scenarios of greenhouse
   gas emissions showed that while sea surface temperature (SST) isotherms
   would shift northwards, saturation isolines of two CaCO3 3 polymorphs,
   calcite (Omega cal) Omega cal) and aragonite (Omega arag), Omega arag),
   would shift southwards by 2100. Subsequent predictions of future
   suitable habitats under those conditions indicated that distinct
   delimitation of geographical ranges for the two species would persist,
   and neither would extend beyond its native geographical zones,
   indicating that tropical Taiwan waters are the northern limit for P.
   acuta. In contrast, , subtropical waters are the southern limit for P.
   damicornis. . We concluded that the decline in CaCO3 3 saturation would
   make high latitudes less inhabitable, which could be one of the boundary
   elements that limit poleward range expansion driven by rising SSTs and
   preserve the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) on Earth.
   Consequently, poleward migration of tropical reef corals to cope with
   warming oceans should be reevaluated.},

Title = {The Impact of Dynamic Emissivity-Temperature Trends on Spaceborne Data:
   Applications to the 2001 Mount Etna Eruption},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Spaceborne detection and measurements of high-temperature thermal
   anomalies enable monitoring and forecasts of lava flow propagation. The
   accuracy of such thermal estimates relies on the knowledge of input
   parameters, such as emissivity, which notably affects computation of
   temperature, radiant heat flux, and subsequent analyses (e.g., effusion
   rate and lava flow distance to run) that rely on the accuracy of
   observations. To address the deficit of field and laboratory-based
   emissivity data for inverse and forward modelling, we measured the
   emissivity of `a'a lava samples from the 2001 Mt. Etna eruption, over
   the wide range of temperatures (773 to 1373 K) and wavelengths (2.17 to
   21.0 mu m). The results show that emissivity is not only wavelength
   dependent, but it also increases non-linearly with cooling, revealing
   considerably lower values than those typically assumed for basalts. This
   new evidence showed the largest and smallest increase in average
   emissivity during cooling in the MIR and TIR regions (similar to 30\%
   and similar to 8\% respectively), whereas the shorter wavelengths of the
   SWIR region showed a moderate increase (similar to 15\%). These results
   applied to spaceborne data confirm that the variable emissivity-derived
   radiant heat flux is greater than the constant emissivity assumption.
   For the differences between the radiant heat flux in the case of
   variable and constant emissivity, we found the median value is 0.06,
   whereas the 25th and the 75th percentiles are 0.014 and 0.161,
   respectively. This new evidence has significant impacts on the modelling
   of lava flow simulations, causing a dissimilarity between the two
   emissivity approaches of similar to 16\% in the final area and similar
   to 7\% in the maximum thickness. The multicomponent emissivity input
   provides means for `best practice' scenario when accurate data required.
   The novel approach developed here can be used to test an improved
   version of existing multi-platform, multi-payload volcano monitoring
   systems.},

Abstract = {Currently, the international scientific community has shown that a
   global phenomenon known as Climate Change is taking place, which can be
   felt with greater intensity in those most sensitive and vulnerable
   places. The Parque Nacional Doflana (PND) is a site where studies are
   being carried out that deal with the possible impact and vulnerability
   of this phenomenon. This research aims to analyze the evolution and
   trend of the temperature and speed of the surface wind in the PND during
   the period 1994 - 2014. For this, data from the global scale
   meteorological model of the European Center for Medium Range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF) were used and the evolution of the monthly average
   (EPM), the evolution and interannual trend (ETI), and the evolution and
   seasonal trend were obtained (ETE). The EPM of both variables is typical
   of the Northern Hemisphere, that is, warm months with mild temperatures
   and less windy, and cold months with mild and windy temperatures. The
   ETI shows different fluctuations, in general a warming trend (0.23
   degrees C) and a slight increase in the wind (0.1 m.s(-1)) were observed
   in the last two decades. TEE for the winter indicates a tendency to be
   colder and less windy; while for the other seasons a tendency to be
   warmer and windier. A temperature increases in spring (0.8 degrees C)
   and summer / autumn (1.5 degrees C) is estimated in the next 35 years.
   The contribution generated in this study represents a guiding element
   for various disciplines related to flora, fauna, marsh flooding, among
   others.},

Title = {Atlantic and Pacific Multidecadal Variability Influence on Taiwan Winter
   Temperature Centennial Trend During the Period 1911-2010},

Abstract = {The sea surface temperature (SST) of the marginal seas off the East
   coast of China is known for its large warming trend during the twentieth
   century. The station data in Taiwan is of particular importance as a
   reliable complementing measurement for SST. This paper analyzes the
   temperature from 1911 - 2010 at six stations using the data adaptive
   method Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). Multidecadal modes
   (period > 40 years) in winter with the warm (1931 - 1950) and cold (1971
   - 1980) phases are identified. In addition to the warm and cold phases,
   the 1951 - 1970 period is identified as the cooling phase, a transition
   phase from a warm to a cold regime, while the 1911 - 1930 and 1991 -
   2010 periods are identified as the warming phase. The multidecadal
   variability in the Taiwan winter temperature is robust because it is
   rooted in the major multidecadal variability modes of the global SST,
   the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), and the Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO). The centennial secular trend (ST) shows much larger
   warming rate than the linearly regressed. Because the multidecadal mode
   has been in a warming phase since 1991, the surpassed warming rate is
   likely due to a compensation effect to the decadal or sub-decadal scale
   cooling variations, while the possibility of anthropogenic influence
   cannot be ruled out.},

   have been used for detecting trend and sequential shift in time series
   of temperature parameters. The results of annual trend analysis for
   period of 1971-2005 show increasing as well as decreasing trends in
   average (T-Mean), maximum (T-Max), minimum (T-Min) temperature and
   increasing trends in Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) at different
   stations. But the annual trend analysis of downscaled data has revealed
   statistically significant (95\% confidence level) rising trends in
   T-Mean, T-Max, T-Min and falling trend in DTR for the period 2011-2099.
   The decreasing trend in DTR is due to higher rate of increase in T-Min

Volume = {79},

Abstract = {Trenbolone acetate (TBA) is a synthetic androgenic steroid hormone
   administered as a subcutaneous implant for growth promotion in beef
   cattle. The primary metabolite excreted in manure from implanted cattle
   is 17 alpha-trenbolone with lesser amounts of 17 beta-trenbolone and
   trendione also present. At 22 degrees C and favorable moisture
   conditions in a controlled laboratory environment, trenbolone degrades
   to trendione in a few hours; however, these conditions are often not
   what exist in the field. Therefore, aerobic degradation rates of 17
   alpha-trenbolone, 17 beta-trenbolone and trendione were determined in a
   sandy soil and silty clay loam under a range of temperature and water
   availability combinations that may be expected in the field. A
   first-order exponential decay model was used to estimate rates and
   generally resulted in good model fits to the data. Degradation rates
   decreased with decreasing water availability (i.e., more negative soil
   matric potential) and decreasing temperature. However, when water
   availability was substantially reduced (-1.0 MPa), hotter temperatures
   (35 degrees C) significantly reduced trenbolone degradation rates. Once
   temperature was low enough to limit microbial activity, no further
   changes were observed with decreasing matric potential. Trendione also
   exhibited similar moisture and temperature dependent degradation, but
   persisted longer than the parent trenbolone. The latter was discussed in
   light of extracellular versus intracellular enzymatic degradation and
   sorption. Half lives at colder temperatures (5 degrees C) even under
   favorable moisture conditions were 2-3d for the trenbolone isomers and
   approached 10 d for trendione. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Effects of temperature extremes on daily mortality in Castile-La Mancha

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine time trends and the geographical distribution
   of mortality trigger temperature thresholds due to extreme temperatures
   in Castile-La Mancha (central Spain) between 1975 and 2003.
   Methods: The analysis was divided into three periods (1975 - 1984, 1985
   - 1994 and 1995 - 2003) for each province of the region. Daily mortality
   due to organic causes (dependent variable) was modelled using
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) procedures. The
   resulting residual series was related to the maximum temperature series
   grouped in 2 degrees C intervals to obtain a threshold temperature for
   cold or heat when the residuals rose significantly (p < 0,05) above the
   mean residual mortality value of the corresponding study period.
   Results: Mortality trigger temperature thresholds decreased over time in
   Castile-La Mancha. In Toledo, the trigger temperature diminished from 40
   degrees C to 38 degrees C. In Cuenca and Guadalajara, threshold
   temperatures for heat events were obtained in the last few decades but
   not in the first. These thresholds varied from the 92nd percentile in
   Cuenca to the 98th percentile in Albacete in the last decade. No
   threshold temperatures for cold spells were observed in any province or
   period.
   Conclusions: Castile-La Mancha registered an upward trend in the
   relationship between high temperatures and mortality, probably due to
   population aging. This trend could have been influenced by the increased
   frequency of extremely hot days. Prevention plans should be periodically
   reviewed. (C) 2009 SESPAS. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights

Title = {Diurnal Temperature Range and Its Response to Heat Waves in 16 European
   Cities-Current and Future Trends},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An important indicator of climate change is the diurnal temperature
   range (DTR), defined as the difference between the daily maximum and
   daily minimum air temperature. This study aims to investigate the DTR
   distribution in European cities of different background climates in
   relation to the season of the year, climate class and latitude, as well
   as its response to exceptionally hot weather. The analysis is based on
   long-term observational records (1961-2019) coupled with Regional
   Climate Model (RCM) data in order to detect any projected DTR trends by
   the end of the 21st century under intermediate and high emission
   greenhouse gases (GHGs) scenarios. The analysis reveals marked
   variations in the magnitude of DTR values between the cities, on the one
   hand, and distinct patterns of the DTR distribution according to the
   climate class of each city, on the other. The results also indicate
   strong seasonal variability in most of the cities, except for the
   Mediterranean coastal ones. DTR is found to increase during hot days and
   heat wave (HW) days compared to summer normal days. High latitude cities
   experience higher increases (3.7 degrees C to 5.7 degrees C for hot
   days, 3.1 degrees C to 5.7 degrees C for HW days) compared to low
   latitude cities (1.3 degrees C to 3.6 degrees C for hot days, 0.5
   degrees C to 3.4 degrees C for HW days). The DTR is projected to
   significantly decrease in northernmost cities (Helsinki, Stockholm,
   Oslo), while it is expected to significantly increase in Madrid by the
   end of the 21st century under both the intermediate- and high-emission
   scenarios, due to the asymmetric temperature change. The asymmetrical
   response of global warming is more pronounced under the high-emission
   scenario where more cities at higher latitudes (Warsaw, Berlin,
   Rotterdam) are added to those with a statistically significant decrease
   in DTR, while others (Bucharest, Nicosia, Zurich) are added to those
   with an increase in DTR.},

Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Extreme heat events (EHEs) have been linked to increased mortality
   rates, rendering them a valuable research topic in both climate and
   public health. Early warning systems are highly impactful in prevention
   and management of heat-related illnesses. We aimed to determine the
   preliminary maximum temperature thresholds for Nagpur and Rajkot city of
   India by analyzing the meteorological and mortality data to enable the
   heat-health response system based on the heat wave disaster risk of a
   particular state and city. We conducted a trend analysis with daily
   maximum temperature and all-cause mortality data of Nagpur and Rajkot
   (2003-2017) cities, also city-specific thresholds evaluated for both
   cities. There was a significant association between all-cause mortality
   and extreme heat events and it was more profound when temperatures were
   above 40.1 degrees C, but V-shaped relationship of mortality-temperature
   was noted only for Nagpur city. The dose-response relationship between
   maximum temperatures and deaths alert thresholds to activate heat health
   response for red alert set at 46 degrees C and 44 degrees C for Nagpur
   and Rajkot city respectively. This study suggests that determining local
   thresholds is important for developing and implementing scientific early
   warning systems to prevent heat-related illnesses.},

Title = {Bell-shaped tree-ring responses to air temperature drive productivity
   trends in long-lived mountain Mediterranean pines},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {We investigated the dendroclimatic response of a Pinus heldreichii
   metapopulation distributed over a wide elevation interval (from 882 to
   2143 m a.s.l.), spanning from low mountain to upper subalpine vegetation
   belts in the southern Italian Apennines. The tested hypothesis is that
   wood growth along an elevational gradient is non-linearly related to air
   temperature. During three years of fieldwork (2012-2015) at 24 sites, we
   collected wood cores from a total of 214 pine trees with diameter at
   breast height from 19 to 180 cm (average 82.7 \& PLUSMN; 32.9 cm). We
   used a combination of tree-ring and genetic methods to reveal factors
   involved in growth acclimation using a space-for-time approach. Scores
   from ca-nonical correspondence analysis were used to combine individual
   tree-ring series into four composite chronologies re-lated to air
   temperature along the elevation gradient. Overall, the June
   dendroclimatic response followed a bell-shaped thermal niche curve,
   increasing until a peak around 13-14 \& DEG;C. A similarly bell-shaped
   response was found with previ-ous autumn air temperature, and both
   dendroclimatic signals interacted with stem size and growth rates,
   generating a divergent growth response between the top and the bottom of
   the elevation gradient. Increased tree growth in the upper subalpine
   belt was consistent with the consequences of increasing air temperature
   under no drought stress. A positive link was uncovered between pine
   growth at all elevations and April mean temperature, with trees growing
   at the lowest elevations showing the strongest growth response. No
   elevational genetic differences were found, hence long-lived tree
   species with small geographical ranges may reverse their climatic
   response between the lower and upper bioclimatic zones of their
   environmental niche. Our study revealed a high resistance and
   acclimation capa-bility of Mediterranean forest stands, and such low
   vulnerability to changing climatic conditions highlights the poten-tial
   to store carbon in these ecosystems for the coming decades.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Forty-seven years of week-long total suspended particle samples
   from Kevo Finland were analyzed for methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and
   sulfate. Kevo is located 350 km north of the Arctic Circle. MSA and
   non-sea-salt sulfate (NSS-SO4) showed clear seasonal trends. MSA peaks
   from May to July, coinciding with warmer waters and increased biogenic
   activity in the surrounding seas. NSS-SO4 peaks in March with a minimum
   during the summer, the typical pattern for Arctic haze. MSA
   concentrations were found to be positively correlated (p<0.001) with sea
   surface temperature anomalies in the surrounding seas. MSA showed a
   trend of 0.405 ng/m(3)/yr (0.680\%/yr) for June and July. NSS-SO4
   concentrations at Kevo declined dramatically in the early 1990s,
   probably as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The decline
   has continued since the mid-1990s.},

   Possible mechanisms for the relationships are suggested. The changes
   from year to year were also analyzed, both on the basis of annual means
   or totals and individual values. The short-term variability is high but
   no dominant cyclic changes were found in the series of annual figures.
   However, most variables show trends over the period studied and although
   these are of relatively small amplitude they are sufficiently large to
   be important biologically. These trends are not shown equally in all
   months which may also be significant from the biological point of view.
   In accordance with observations elsewhere in the northern hemisphere it
   is suggested that the trends are related to changes in the atmospheric
   circulation, which may be brought about by changes in the amount of heat
   reaching the earth from the sun.},

Title = {Climate vulnerability of Swedish newborns: Gender differences and time
   trends of temperature-related neonatal mortality, 1880-1950},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {192},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: In resource-poor societies, neonatal mortality (death in the
   first 28 days of life) is usually very high. Young infants are
   particularly vulnerable to environmental health risks, which are
   modified by socioeconomic factors that change over time. We investigated
   the association between ambient temperature and neonatal mortality in
   northern Sweden during the demographic transition.
   Methods: Parish register data and temperature data in coastal
   Vasterbotten, Sweden, between 1880 and 1950 were used. Total and
   sex-specific neonatal mortality was modelled as a function of mean
   temperature, adjusting for age, seasonality and calendar time, using
   discrete-time survival analysis. A linear threshold function was applied
   with a cut point at 14.5 degrees C (the minimum mortality temperature).
   Odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed.
   Further analyses were stratified by study period (1800-1899, 1900-1929,
   and 1930-1950).
   Results: Neonatal mortality was 32.1 deaths/1000 live births, higher in
   boys than in girls, and decreased between 1880 and 1950, with high
   inter-annual variability. Mean daily temperature was +2.5 degrees C,
   ranging from 40.9 degrees C to +28.8 degrees C. At -20 degrees C, the OR
   of neonatal death was 1.56 (CI 1.30-1.87) compared to the reference at
   +14.5 degrees C. Among girls, the OR of mortality at -20 degrees C was
   1.17 (0.88-1.54), and among boys, it was 1.94 (1.53-2.45). A temperature
   increase from +14.5 to +20 degrees C was associated with a 25\% increase
   of neonatal mortality (OR 1.25, CI 1.04-1.50). Heat- and cold-related
   risks were lowest between 1900 and 1929.
   Conclusions: In this remote sub-Arctic region undergoing socio-economic
   changes, we found an increased mortality risk in neonates related to low
   but also to high temperature. Climate vulnerability varied across time
   and was particularly high among boys. This demonstrates that
   environmental impacts on human health are complex and highly dependent
   on the specific local context, with many, often unknown, contributing
   determinants of vulnerability.},

Abstract = {After the construction of Qinghai-Tibet Highway and Railway, the
   Qinghai-Tibet Power Transmission (QTPT) line is another major permafrost
   engineering project with new types of engineering structures. The
   changing process and trend of ground temperature around tower
   foundations are crucial for the stability of QTPT. We analyzed the
   change characteristics and tendencies of the ground temperature based on
   field monitoring data from 2010 to 2014. The results reveal that soil
   around the tower foundations froze and connected with the artificial
   permafrost induced during the construction of footings after the first
   freezing period, and the soil below the original permafrost table kept
   freezing in subsequent thawing periods. The ground temperature lowered
   to that of natural fields, fast or slowly for tower foundations with
   thermosyphons, while for tower foundations without thermosyphons, the
   increase in ground temperature resulted in higher temperature than that
   of natural fields. Also, the permafrost temperature and ice content are
   significant factors that influence the ground temperature around tower
   foundations. Specifically, the ground temperature around tower
   foundations in warm and ice-rich permafrost regions decreased slowly,
   while that in cold and ice poor permafrost regions cooled faster.
   Moreover, foundations types impacted the ground temperature, which
   consisted of different technical processes during construction and
   variant of tower footing structures. The revealed changing process and
   trend of the ground temperature is beneficial for evaluating the thermal
   regime evolution around tower foundations in the context of climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Changes in climatic variables at the sub-basins scale (having different
   features of land cover) are crucial for planning, development and
   designing of water resources infrastructure in the context of climate
   change. Accordingly, to explore the features of climate changes in
   sub-basins of the Source Region of Yellow River (SRYR), absolute changes
   and trends of temperature variables, maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum
   temperature (Tmin), mean temperature (Tavg) and diurnal temperature
   range (DTR), were analyzed annually and seasonally by using daily
   observed air temperature dataset from 1965 to 2014. Results showed that
   annual Tmax, Tmin and Tavg for the SRYR were experiencing warming trends
   respectively at the rate of 0.28, 0.36 and 0.31A degrees C (10 yr)(-1).
   In comparison with the 1st period (1965-1989), more absolute changes and
   trends towards increasing were observed during the 2nd period
   (1990-2014). Apart from Tangnaihai (a low altitude sub-basin), these
   increasing trends and changes seemed more significant in other basins
   with highest magnitude during winter. Among sub-basins the increasing
   trends were more dominant in Huangheyan compared to other sub-basins.
   The largest increase magnitude of Tmin, 1.24 and 1.18A degrees C (10
   yr)(-1), occurred in high altitude sub-basins Jimai and Huangheyan,
   respectively, while the smallest increase magnitude of 0.23A degrees C
   (10 yr)(-1) occurred in a low altitude sub-basin Tangnaihai. The high
   elevation difference in Tangnaihai probably was the main reason for the
   less increase in the magnitude of Tmin. In the last decade, smaller
   magnitude of trend for all temperature variables signified the signal of
   cooling in the region. Overall, changes of temperature variables had
   significant spatial and seasonal variations. It implies that seasonal
   variations of runoff might be greater or different for each sub-basin.},

Title = {The Effects of Gridding Algorithms on the Statistical Moments and Their
   Trends of Daily Surface Air Temperature},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {This paper explores the effects from averaging weather station data onto
   a grid on the first four statistical moments of daily minimum and
   maximum surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies over the entire globe.
   The Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCND) and the Met
   Office Hadley Centre GHCND (HadGHCND) datasets from 1950 to 2010 are
   examined. The GHCND station data exhibit large spatial patterns for each
   moment and statistically significant moment trends from 1950 to 2010,
   indicating that SAT probability density functions are non-Gaussian and
   have undergone characteristic changes in shape due to decadal
   variability and/or climate change. Comparisons with station data show
   that gridded averages always underestimate observed variability,
   particularly in the extremes, and have altered moment trends that are in
   some cases opposite in sign over large geographic areas. A statistical
   closure approach based on the quasi-normal approximation is taken to
   explore SAT's higher-order moments and point correlation structure. This
   study focuses specifically on relating variability calculated from
   station data to that from gridded data through the moment equations for
   weighted sums of random variables. The higher-order and nonlinear
   spatial correlations up to the fourth order demonstrate that
   higher-order moments at grid scale can be determined approximately by
   functions of station pair correlations that tend to follow the usual
   Kolmogorov scaling relation. These results can aid in the development of
   constraints to reduce uncertainties in climate models and have
   implications for studies of atmospheric variability, extremes, and
   climate change using gridded observations.},

Abstract = {Trend magnitudes of 11 indices of temperature extremes at 71 stations
   with elevations above 2000 m a. s.l. in the eastern and central Tibetan
   Plateau (TP) during 1961 - 2005 are examined. Most trends in extremes
   are consistent with general warming in the TP. There are no significant
   correlations between elevation and trend magnitude of temperature
   extremes with the exception of TXn (coldest day temperature) and TX10
   (cold day frequency). Thus an enhanced sensitivity of temperature
   extremes at higher elevations in the eastern and central TP is not
   apparent in the context of recent warming in this region. Although
   previous work showed a correlation between elevation and mean
   temperature trends in the TP, this analysis fails to substantiate this
   relationship for extremes. Analysis of trend magnitudes by topographic
   type and degree of urbanization show both factors to have a strong
   influence in this dataset, which overrides that of elevation.},

Abstract = {The solar activity expressed in its various forms (the total solar
   irradiance (TSI) and a permanent injection of the solar charged
   particles called as the solar wind) is considered in this study as a
   possible candidate capable to influence on the long-term variations of
   the atmospheric temperature. The data of atmospheric balloon sounding at
   four polar and subpolar stations were chosen for the study of long-term
   variations of atmospheric temperature as functions of the solar
   activity. The experimentally observed long-term trends in variations of
   the tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures could be related to some
   extent to the variability of the solar activity. The impact of the solar
   wind energy on thermal regime of the stratosphere and troposphere in the
   Arctic could be different due to non-uniformity of electric conductivity
   of the ground surface as well as to different relations between
   conductivity of the atmospheric layers and ground surface. (C) 2006

   temperature based on EMD and least square},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},

Volume = {111},

Abstract = {The trend analysis of the temperature change of burning zone is very
   important for the normal production of cement clinker. In this paper,
   empirical mode decomposition (EMD) combined with the least square method
   is researched to realize the trend extraction and identification of
   cement burning zone flame temperature. Firstly, the temperature data is
   decomposed by EMD to obtain every intrinsic mode function (IMF) and the
   remainder. Then, the least square method is used to fit every IMF and
   the remainder. With the fitting error as the judgment criterion, the
   trend of the signal is extracted as the combination of the IMF
   components with less fitting error and the remainder. Further, the first
   derivative of the fitting function is used to determine the fundamental
   change in the trend of the signal, and the trend identification result
   is obtained. At last, the trend extraction and identification method is
   validated on the burning zone temperature data obtained from a cement
   company. The results show that the trend extraction and identification
   of the burning zone temperature based on EMD and least square is
   effective. More importantly, the method proposed in this paper can
   automatically determine the number of EMD decomposition layers. It does
   not have the problem of artificial selection of basis function and
   decomposition layers, and does not require empirical knowledge and
   complex experimental procedures for extracting trend item of burning
   zone temperature. This paper provides a feasible method for the
   extraction and identification of the burning zone temperature.},

Abstract = {Understanding the causes of long-term temperature trends is at the core
   of climate change studies. Any observed trend can result from natural
   variability or anthropogenic influences or both. In the present study,
   we evaluated the performance of 18 climate models from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 on simulating the Asian diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) and explored the potential causes of the
   long-term trend in the DTR by examining the response of the DTR to
   natural forcing (volcanic aerosols and solar variability) and
   anthropogenic forcing (anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) and
   aerosols) in the historical period of 1961-2005. For the climatology,
   the multimodel ensemble mean reproduced the geographical distribution
   and amplitude of the DTR over eastern China and India but underestimated
   the magnitudes of the DTR over the Tibetan Plateau and the high-latitude
   regions of the Asian continent. These negative biases in the DTR over
   frigid zones existed in most models. Seasonal biases in the DTR pattern
   from models were similar to the bias in the annual mean DTR pattern.
   Based on three selected state-of-the-art models, the observed decreasing
   trend in the DTR over Asia was reasonably reproduced in the all-forcing
   run. A comparison of separate forcing experiments revealed that
   anthropogenic forcing plays the dominant role in the declining trend in
   the DTR. Observations and model simulations showed that GHG forcing is
   mainly responsible for the negative trends in the DTR over Asia but that
   anthropogenic aerosol forcing was also behind the decreasing trend in
   the DTR over China and especially over eastern China.},

Title = {Global burden of non-optimal temperature attributable stroke: The
   long-term trends, population growth and aging effects},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Since the 20th century, the world has undergone climate change,
   population growth and population aging, which may result in alterations
   in the epidemiology of non-optimal temperature-associated strokes. We
   employed multiple methodologies and data from the global burden of
   disease 2019 to unveil the long-term curvilinear trends in strokes
   attributed to non-optimal temperature and the impact of aging and
   population growth on its changing epidemiology. From 1990 to 2019, the
   age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) of strokes attributable to low
   temperature had been decreasing, but from 2016, the continued downward
   trend in ASDR disappeared and began to remain stable. On the contrary,
   the ASDR of strokes attributable to high temperature continued to
   increase. The high socio-demographic index (SDI) region experienced the
   fastest decreased trend. The disease burden of stroke attributable to
   low temperature is increased by aging in 178 countries (87.25\%),
   compared with 130 (63.73\%) for high temperature. After excluding aging
   and population growth, the DALY rate for strokes attributed to high
   temperature was increasing in 87 countries and territories (42.64\%).
   The disease burden of strokes attributed to low temperature is far
   greater than that of high temperature in absolute figures. However,
   globally, there is a significant trend toward an increase in strokes
   attributed to high temperature. Social development has largely offset
   the burden of strokes attributed to low temperature, but most regions of
   the world are equally affected by strokes attributed to high
   temperature. Simultaneously, in the framework of climate change, aging
   is also largely hindering stroke prevention efforts.},

Title = {Temperature trends and elevation dependent warming during 1965-2014 in
   headwaters of Yangtze River, Qinghai Tibetan Plateau},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {The understanding of temperature trends in high elevation mountain areas
   is an integral part of climate change research and it is critical for
   assessing the impacts of climate change on water resources including
   glacier melt, degradation of soils, and active layer thickness. In this
   study, climate changes were analyzed based on trends in air temperature
   variables (T-max, T-min, T-mean), and Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) as
   well as elevation-dependent warming at annual and seasonal scales in the
   Headwaters of Yangtze River (HWYZ), Qinghai Tibetan Plateau. The Base
   Period (1965-2014) was split into two subperiods; Period-I (1965-1989)
   and Period-II (1990- 2014) and the analysis was constrained over two
   subbasins; Zhimenda and Tuotuohe. Increasing trends were found in
   absolute changes in temperature variables during Period-II as compared
   to Period-I. T-max, T-min, and T-mean had significant increasing trends
   for both sub-basins. The highest significant trends in annual time scale
   were observed in T-min (1.15 degrees C decade(-1)) in Tuotuohe and 0.98
   degrees C decade(-1) in Zhimenda sub-basins. In Period-II, only the
   winter season had the highest magnitudes of T-max and T-min 0.58 degrees
   C decade(-1) and 1.26 degrees C decade(-1) in Tuotuohe subbasin,
   respectively. Elevation dependent warming analysis revealed that T-max,
   T-min and T-mean trend magnitudes increase with the increase of
   elevations in the middle reaches (4000 m to 4400 m) of the HWYZ during
   Period-II annually. The increasing trend magnitude during Period-II, for
   T-max, is 1.77, 0.92, and 1.31 degrees C decade(-1), for T-min 1.20,
   1.32 and 1.59 degrees C decade(-1), for T-mean 1.51, 1.10 and 1.51
   degrees C decade(-1) at elevations of 4066 m, 4175 m and 4415 m
   respectively in the winter season. T-mean increases during the spring
   season for > 3681 m elevations during Period-II, with no particular
   relation with elevation dependency for other variables. During the
   summer season in Period- II, T-max, T-min, T-mean increases with the
   increase of elevations (3681 m to 4415 m) in the middle reaches of HWYZ.
   Elevation dependent warming (EDW), the study concluded that magnitudes
   of T-min are increasing significantly after the 1990s as compared to
   T-max in the HWYZ. It is concluded that the climate of the HWYZ is
   getting warmer in both sub-basins and the rate of warming was more
   evident after the 1990s. The outcomes of the study provide an essential
   insight into climate change in the region and would be a primary index
   to select and design research scenarios to explore the impacts of
   climate change on water resources.},

   reanalysis products. The equivalent tropospheric and stratospheric
   temperature from radiosonde and reanalyses are calculated based on the
   vertical weighting function of the MSU channel 2 (CH2) and channel 4
   (CH4) measurements, respectively. The results show that both cooling in
   the stratosphere and warming in troposphere significantly depends on the

Title = {An Analysis of the Stability and Trends in the LST\_cci Land Surface
   Temperature Datasets Over Europe},
Journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Long-term satellite land surface temperature (LST) data are desirable to
   augment 2m air temperatures (T2m) measured in situ and as an independent
   measure of surface temperature change. However, previous studies show
   variable agreement between LST and T2m time series. The objective of
   this study is to assess the stability and trends in six new LST data
   sets from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative for LST
   (LST\_cci). LST anomalies are compared with homogenized station T2m
   anomalies over Europe, which verifies all six data sets are well coupled
   (LST vs T2m anomaly correlations and slopes: 0.6-0.9). The temporal
   stability of the LST\_cci data is assessed through a comparison with the
   T2m anomaly time series. Only the LST\_cci data sets for the MODerate
   resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and the
   Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) appear stable; the
   MODIS/Terra, ATSR-2, and multisensor InfraRed and MicroWave data sets
   show non-climatic discontinuities associated with changes in sensor
   and/or drift over time. For MODIS/Aqua (2002-2018), significant trends
   in LST of 0.64-0.66 K/decade compare well with the equivalent T2m trends
   of 0.52-0.59 K/decade. The LST and T2m trends for AATSR (2002-2012) are
   found to be statistically insignificant, likely due to the comparatively
   short study period and specific years available for analysis. No
   evidence is found to suggest that trends calculated using cloud-free
   InfraRed observations are affected by clear-sky bias. This study
   suggests that satellite LST data can be used to assess warming trends
   over land and for other climate applications if the required homogeneity
   is assured.
   Plain Language Summary Long-term changes in surface temperature due to
   climate change are usually studied using near-surface air temperatures
   (T2m) from weather stations. However, these data are not available
   everywhere and changes in T2m are poorly understood in some regions
   (e.g., parts of Africa). This study assesses the potential for
   satellite-observed land surface temperatures (LST) to help fill these
   gaps. The study finds that LST and T2m provide very similar information
   on surface temperatures and therefore LST can provide useful information
   where T2m data are unavailable. However, some of the LST data sets are
   found to be ``unstable{''} and suffer from jumps and changes over time
   that result from for example, changes in satellite instrument or a
   change in the orbit of the satellite platform. These unstable LST data
   sets cannot be used to measure changes in surface temperature. However,
   the study finds that for ``stable{''} LST data sets, which do not suffer
   from these non-climatic jumps and changes, the changes in LST over time
   are very similar to, or even the same as, the changes in T2m. Therefore,
   this work suggests that satellite LST data could be used to measure
   changes in surface temperature where there are not enough stations to
   make these measurements using T2m.},

Title = {Temporal trends of the association between ambient temperature and
   cardiovascular mortality: a 17-year case-crossover study},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Aim. To examine the temporal variations of the association between
   ambient temperature and mortality for cardiovascular diseases in
   Queensland, Australia between 1997 and 2013.
   Methods. We obtained 147 238 cardiovascular deaths data from Queensland
   Health between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2013. Time-stratified
   case-crossover design was fitted via the conditional quasi-Poisson
   regression with time-varying distributed lag non-linear model to
   estimate the associations between temperature and cardiovascular
   mortality. Stratified analyses were performed by age, sex, climate zone,
   and socioeconomic status.
   Results. We found a substantial decrease in the cold effect, while there
   was no significant change in the heat effect. Results of subgroup
   analyses showed an increasing trend for heat effects in men, people 84
   years old, those living in low and middle socioeconomic areas and those
   living in hot climate areas. There was a decreasing trend for the
   magnitude of associations between temperature (both cold and hot
   temperatures) and cardiovascular mortality in people 85 years old and in
   areas of high socioeconomic status.
   Conclusions. The associations between cold temperature and
   cardiovascular mortality decreased in Queensland, Australia between 1997
   and 2013, but no declines were observed for hot temperatures. Men,
   people 84 years old, people living in low and middle socioeconomic score
   areas and people living in hot climate areas demonstrated increased
   susceptibility to hot temperatures. Our findings suggest a need for heat
   awareness health promotion campaigns to enhance adaptation to a warming
   climate among vulnerable population.},

Title = {Trends and irregular variation of spatial temperature differences in the

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {41-57},
Abstract = {Spatio-temporal dynamics of urban heat island (UHI) and other spatial
   temperature variations were studied for a 17 yr period (2002-2018) in
   the mid-sized (193 000 inhabitants in 2019) coastal city of Turku in
   south-western Finland. The study was based on GIS data and 30 min
   interval air temperature observations from 52 observation sites in the
   city and its surroundings. Correlation and regression analyses, image
   interpretation and various GIS methods were used to investigate
   temperature dynamics and associated factors on a diurnal, monthly and
   seasonal basis. The results showed relative cooling and warming trends
   of certain areas as well as fluctuating and random variation of the
   coldest and warmest regions, respectively. Relative cooling trends were
   observed in semi-urban and urban areas that remained unchanged during
   the study period. Relative warming trends were most common in semi-urban
   areas where urbanization and construction of new buildings occurred
   rapidly. Fluctuating variation was mainly related to variation in
   weather conditions, especially the severity of winter and related
   sea-ice extent on the archipelago south-west of the city. The UHI
   intensity showed a slight, albeit statistically significant,
   intensifying trend of 0.11 degrees C per decade. Our findings
   demonstrate the dynamic nature of spatio-temporal intra-urban
   temperature differences, a fact that should more actively be taken into
   account in climate-related urban planning in general.},

Abstract = {A long-term series of meteorological measurements will allow for a
   better understanding of the rate and nature of climate change. Such
   analysis presumes a historical knowledge of the particular place of
   measurements and changing measurement techniques, as well as a further
   evaluation of the quality of the available data. This research focuses
   on the city of Pozna and temperature measurements conducted from 1848 to
   2016. By 1919, the location of meteorological stations had changed five
   times, causing time-series inhomogeneities. In 1921, meteorological
   measurements began to be carried out at the Pozna-awica airport, which
   have there been maintained to this day. The monthly means of air
   temperature for the period 1848-1919 clearly indicate a break in their
   homogeneity. For this reason, the main objective of this study is to
   reconstruct the 169-year long air temperature records in a homogeneous
   way so as to make it coherent with the surrounding series of long-term
   measurements. Data gaps are supplemented by the constant difference
   method based on the homogenized data series from the nearest stations.
   The monthly means are homogenized according to the Alexanderson's
   Standard Normal Homogeneity Test. In addition, evaluation of the annual,
   seasonal, and monthly temperature trends is also provided. An increasing
   long-term trend can be observed for the entire period of analysis. For
   the years 1848-2016, the air temperature grew at a rate of 1.1 degrees C
   per 100years. As far as seasons go, the highest increase was observed in
   Winter (+1.5 degrees C/100years) with the lowest in Summer (+0.6 degrees
   C/100years). In the last 30years, the pace of trend has increased to a
   rate of +4.6 degrees C per 100years, with the highest values recorded
   for Summer (+7.5 degrees C/100years).},

Title = {Trend, seasonality, and abrupt change detection method for land surface
   temperature time-series analysis: Evaluation and improvement},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {280},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Long-term land surface temperature (LST) variation is vital for the
   study of climate change and environmental monitoring. Change detection
   methods provide access to recovery trajectories of trend and seasonality
   and detect abrupt changes in LST time series, but a comprehensive
   evaluation of the published methods is lacking. In this study, simulated
   LST data with a temporal resolution of 8 days under different scenarios
   were used to evaluate the performance of three commonly used methods:
   Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST), Breaks
   for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST), and Bayesian Estimator of
   Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). The results obtained
   using the simulated data indicated that BEAST was the best method for
   decomposing LST time series into trend and seasonality (mean RMSEs were
   0.28 K and 0.27 K, respectively) and for detecting abrupt changes in
   these two components (mean F1 scores were 0.83 and 0.95, respectively).
   BFAST was less robust to high-complexity data (F1: 0.56 and 0.52, RMSE:
   1.34 K and 1.46 K). 0.91 K and 1.29 K). DBEST is recommended to capture
   component details because it yields the least generalized output (F1 for
   trend: 0.37, RMSE: 0.64 K and 1.37 K). Both BFAST and DBEST exhibited
   reduced accuracy when the time-series data has long-lasting continuous
   missing data. An application using the 20-year MODIS LST time series
   supports the results obtained using the simulated data. BEAST exhibited
   the highest detection accuracy for land cover change (13 correct
   detections among 15 true changes), followed by DBEST (9) and BFAST (7).
   All three methods were ineffective for detecting low-magnitude
   disturbances: wildfires, heatwaves, and cold spells due to their low
   intensity or short duration. To reduce the non-negligible commission
   error of BEAST, this study proposes an improved BEAST, which eliminates
   the false breakpoints in BEAST using a set of thresholds. Compared with
   BEAST, the user accuracy of the improved BEAST was significantly
   increased by 13.9\% in the simulated data, resulting in an F1 increase
   of 0.04, and 15 false breakpoints were eliminated among 53 detected
   disturbances in the MODIS LST time series. This study outlines commonly
   used change detection methods and offers guidance for choosing the
   optimal method to detect changes in LST time series. Furthermore,
   suggestions on the determination of parameters and false breakpoints
   elimination in the improved BEAST enable it more practical.},

   the Urmia Lake basin, for the period 1972-2011 was employed. The
   prewhitening approach was applied to remove the effects of serial
   correlation in the air temperature series based on the Mann-Kendall (MK)
   test. The results of Ljung-Box test showed positive serial correlation
   in the T-mean and T-max series for all of the stations at the 0.05
   significance level. In the monthly series, the significant warming
   trends in the T-mean series were more perceptible than the same ones in
   T-max series; however, T-max trend was found more than T-min series. The
   Mann-Whitney (MW) test detected a significance upward shift changes in
   the annual T-mean, T-max and T-min series of about 86, 73 and 80 \% of
   the stations, respectively. The average magnitude of significant warming
   trends in annual T-mean, T-max and T-min series were (+) 0.58 degrees C,
   (+) 0.52 degrees C and (+) 0.69 degrees C per decade, respectively.
   Furthermore, the interpolation maps showed that warming trends in the
   east and west of Urmia Lake were more than southern area. Therefore, the
   results showed that the basin has suffered from increasing trends in the
   T-mean, T-max and T-min ov er the recent decades. Finally, significant
   changes were found in 1980s and 1990s based on the Mann-Kendall ranks
   and change point tests. In this study, it is interesting that the period
   of significant changes in warming trends were close to the beginning of
   decreasing water level of the Lake.},

Title = {High-precision abundances of elements in solar twin stars Trends with
   stellar age and elemental condensation temperature},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {579},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Context. High-precision determinations of abundances of elements in the
   atmospheres of the Sun and solar twin stars indicate that the Sun has an
   unusually low ratio between refractory and volatile elements. This has
   led to the suggestion that the relation between abundance ratios,
   {[}X/Fe], and elemental condensation temperature, T-C, can be used as a
   signature of the existence of terrestrial planets around a star.
   Aims. HARPS spectra with S/N greater than or similar to 600 for 21 solar
   twin stars in the solar neighborhood and the Sun (observed via reflected
   light from asteroids) are used to determine very precise (sigma similar
   to 0.01 dex) differential abundances of elements in order to see how
   well {[}X/Fe] is correlated with T-C and other parameters such as
   stellar age.
   Methods. Abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn,
   and Y are derived from equivalent widths of weak and medium-strong
   spectral lines using MARCS model atmospheres with parameters determined
   from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines. Non-LTE effects
   are considered and taken into account for some of the elements. In
   addition, precise (sigma less than or similar to 0.8 Gyr) stellar ages
   are obtained by interpolating between Yonsei-Yale isochrones in the log
   g - T-eff diagram.
   Results. It is confirmed that the ratio between refractory and volatile
   elements is lower in the Sun than in most of the solar twins (only one
   star has the same {[}X/Fe]-T-C distribution as the Sun), but for many
   stars, the relation between {[}X/Fe] and T-C is not well defined. For
   several elements there is an astonishingly tight correlation between
   {[}X/Fe] and stellar age with amplitudes up to similar to 0.20 dex over
   an age interval of eight Gyr in contrast to the lack of correlation
   between {[}Fe/H] and age. While {[}Mg/Fe] increases with age, the
   s-process element yttrium shows the opposite behavior meaning that
   {[}Y/Mg] can be used as a sensitive chronometer for Galactic evolution.
   The Na/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are not well correlated with stellar age, but
   define a tight Ni-Na relation similar to that previously found for more
   metal-poor stars albeit with a smaller amplitude. Furthermore, the C/O
   ratio evolves very little with time, although {[}C/Fe] and {[}O/Fe]
   change by similar to 0.15 dex.
   Conclusions. The dependence of {[}X/Fe] on stellar age and the
   {[}Ni/Fe]-{[}Na/Fe] variations complicate the use of the {[}X/Fe]-T-C
   relation as a possible signature for the existence of terrestrial
   planets around stars. The age trends for the various abundance ratios
   provide new constraints on supernovae yields and Galactic chemical
   evolution, and the slow evolution of C/O for solar metallicity stars is
   of interest for discussions of the composition of exoplanets.},

Abstract = {The vertical temperature structure in the area of Garmisch-Partenkirchen
   between the Loisach river valley and the highest mountain in Germany
   (Zugspitze, 2962 m a.s.l.) is analysed. Using long time series
   (19362008) of daily mean, minimum and maximum temperatures from two
   meteorological stations, in the valley floor and on the mountain top, we
   studied seasonal variations in temperature lapse rates. By using daily
   data on weather types, significantly different altitudinal temperature
   lapse rates and daily temperature ranges for low and high pressure
   weather situations were found. There was no significant influence of
   snow cover in the valley on the lapse rate. At both stations, there has
   been an increase in temperature during recent decades. As there was a
   slight difference between these trends, the lapse rate has tended to
   become more negative, i.e. the difference between the mountain top and
   the valley has become more pronounced. In order to investigate the lapse
   rates in more detail, unpublished temperature data from 1989 to 1990 on
   slope transects near Garmisch-Partenkirchen were evaluated. Despite the
   fact that an exact description of the vertical structure of the
   atmospheric temperature is possible only from free air measurements,
   there are some indications that major inversions occur in the first 500
   m above the valley ground, depending on season, weather situation and
   time of day. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Polycarbosilane (PCS) fiber as a precursor for ceramic fiber of silicon
   carbide was cured by electron beam (EB) irradiation under oxygen free
   atmosphere. Oxygen content in the cured PCS fiber was scarce and the
   obtained silicon carbide (SIC) fiber with low oxygen content showed high
   heat resistance up to 1973 K and tensile strength of 3 GPa. Also, the EB
   cured PCS fiber with very low oxygen content could be converted to
   silicon nitride (Si3N4) fiber by the pyrolysis in NH, gas atmosphere,
   which was the new processing to produce Si3N4 fiber. The process of SIC
   fiber synthesis was developed to the commercial plant.
   The other application was the crosslinking of polytetrafluoroethylene
   (PTFE). PTFE, which had been recognized to be a typical chain scission
   polymer, could be induced to crosslinking by irradiation at the molten
   state in oxygen free atmosphere. The physical properties such as
   crystallinity, mechanical properties, etc, changed much by crosslinking,
   and the radiation resistance was much improved. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {In this work, 29 elements were evaluated as promoters for silica
   supported iron catalysts for high temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
   using a high-throughput experimentation unit. The selected promoters
   include alkali/alkaline metals, transition metals, precious metals and
   lanthanides. Several general selectivity trends were observed and
   discussed. The selectivity enhancement to light olefins requires
   maintaining low selectivity to methane and light paraffins and at the
   same time, slowing the chain growth to the C5+ hydrocarbons.
   A major increase in Fischer-Tropsch rate principally due to higher
   intrinsic site activity, was observed over the catalysts promoted with
   metals with low melting points such as tin, antimony, bismuth and lead.
   These promoted catalysts also exhibited better stability. The effect of
   the promotion with tin and antimony on the olefin selectivity was not
   noticeable, while the presence of bismuth and lead results in the major
   enhancement of the selectivity to light olefins, lower methane and
   C-2-C-4 paraffin selectivities.},

Title = {Spatial and temporal analysis of trends in extreme temperature indices

Abstract = {The recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in frequency, severity,
   duration and geographical extent of extreme weather events. Having an
   area of 1648195km(2), Iran spans over a wide latitudinal range and
   enjoys a diverse terrain in terms of topography and elevation. The
   combination of this topographic complexity with the effects of extensive
   water bodies in the north and the south plays a major role in the
   distribution of temperature over this country. This study analysed the
   temporal trend of extreme temperature indices observed in 33 synoptic
   stations across Iran over the period 1960-2014, and then examined their
   relationship with elevation and latitude. The results showed a
   significant warming trend in extreme temperature indices of many
   stations, especially the indices that are based on daily minimum
   temperature. At low elevations, the trends of indices exhibited the
   features of a warming climate, but at higher elevations, these indices
   showed a mixture of positive and negative trends. Examining the
   relationship between the trends of indices and elevation showed that in
   the altitudinal band E1 {[}elevations lower than 23m above sea level
   (ASL)], only the trend of growing season length is correlated with
   elevation; but in the altitudinal band E2 (elevations higher than 700m
   ASL), elevation exhibited significant correlation with the trends of
   percentage of cool nights, frequency of frost days, diurnal temperature
   range, cold spell duration, percentage of warm nights and frequency of
   tropical nights. The analysis did not show any meaningful relationship
   between extreme temperature indices trends with latitude. Considering
   the high heterogeneity of the trends of indices and the limited number
   of stations with sufficient data, generalizing the results and
   predicting the wider trend patterns require further studies using a
   denser network of stations.},

   the help of application of methods of multi-fractal dynamics. Over the
   period of 1010 years there were founded 26 periods and for each of them
   a value of fractal dimension of D was settled. Also, the function of
   jumps of difference h = D - D-0 (where D-0 is an equilibrium value of
   fractal dimension) describing the dynamics of fractal dimension for the
   period under consideration was constructed. The question of correlation
   of a historical process and behavior of function h has been discussed.},

Title = {Solvent vapor effects in planar high-field asymmetric waveform ion
   mobility spectrometry: Solvent trends and temperature effects},

Abstract = {Solvent vapor added to the drift gas in a planar high-field asymmetric
   waveform ion mobility spectrometer (FAIMS) leads to dramatic shifts to
   larger CV values while retaining narrow peaks, leading to dramatically
   increased resolving power (up to 140) for a variety of ions including
   isomeric ions. Here we present studies designed to improve the
   fundamental understanding of the role of solvent vapor on performance of
   planar FAIMS, focusing on solvent trends with molecular size and effects
   of temperature. The studies employ as test compounds the {[}M-H](-) ions
   of the three positional isomers of phthalic acid and the M- and
   {[}M-H](-) ions of trinitrotoluene (TNT). The addition of solvent vapor
   to FAIMS carrier gas has a significant impact on the behavior of the
   ions inside the FAIMS cell and can impact the overall performance of the
   cell. We have shown that by comparing a range of solvent vapors (water
   and C-1-C-4 alcohols), the magnitude of the effect correlates to the
   molecular volume of the solvent molecule. This fits well with the model
   of clustering/declustering of ions with neutral molecules on the time
   scale of waveform used in FAIMS. We have also shown that with the
   addition of heat, the effect of the solvent vapor is lessened, as one
   would expect with the cluster/decluster model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Here we report on trends in mercury (Hg) concentrations in lake trout
   (Salvelinus namaycush), burbot (Lota Iota), and northern pike (Esox
   lucius) from Great Slave Lake, located in the Mackenzie River Basin
   (MRB) and investigate how climate factors may be influencing these
   trends. Hg concentrations in lake trout and burbot increased
   significantly over the early 1990s to 2012 in the two major regions of
   the lake; no trend was evident for northern pike over 1999-2012.
   Temporal variations in Hg concentrations in lake trout and burbot were
   similar with respect to timing of peaks and troughs. Inclusion of
   climate variables based on annual means, particularly temperature,
   improved explanatory power for variations in Hg over analyses based only
   on year and fish length; unexpectedly, the temperature coefficient was
   negative. Climate analyses based on growing season means (defined as May
   September) had less explanatory power suggesting that trends were more
   strongly associated with colder months within the year. Inclusion of the
   Pacific/North American index improved explanatory power for the lake
   trout model suggesting that trends may have been affected by air
   circulation patterns. Overall, while our study confirmed previously
   reported trends of Hg increase in burbot in the MRB, we found no
   evidence that these trends were directly driven by increasing
   temperatures and productivity.},

Title = {Body temperature trends of critically Ill patients on continuous renal

Abstract = {Background: Interpretation of human body temperature in patients on
   continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is chal-lenging. Clinicians
   currently use definitions of `normal' temperature derived from healthy
   patients over a century ago and apply these definitions to patients on
   continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). There is a significant
   opportunity to refine tem-perature definitions to apply to the
   increasing population of critically ill patients on CRRT. Methods: A
   total of 1361 critically ill patients admitted to the hospital between
   12/1/2006 and 11/31/2015 and requiring CRRT were studied. Temperature
   data were summarized (median, IQR) and compared during time periods that
   patients were on CRRT and time periods that they were not on CRRT using
   paired comparisons. Additionally, analyses were per-formed to compare
   temperature dynamics between patients who died during their
   hospitalization with those who did not. Results: The median body
   temperature change was-0.6 degrees C (95\% CI-1.3,-0.6) from 12 h before
   CRRT to 12 h after CRRT (p < .001), and an increase of 0.6 degrees C
   (95\% CI 0.2, 0.6) from 12 h before CRRT end to 12 h after CRRT end (p <
   .001). Temperature significantly increased by a median 0.3 degrees C
   from the start to the end of CRRT. Conclusions: There are significant
   body temperature changes in critically ill patients on CRRT with cooling
   at the time of CRRT initiation and warming at the time of CRRT
   cessation.},

Title = {Role of Japan Sea Throughflow in the spatial variability of the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {80},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Japan Sea shows a much stronger warming of long-term sea surface
   temperature (SST) than surrounding oceans. The warming trend possesses a
   meridionally alternating zonal band pattern, with weak trends along the
   paths of the Japan Sea Throughflow and strong trends in the remaining
   interior region. Using idealized models of the Japan Sea Throughflow and
   atmospheric heating, this study examines the process behind the
   formation of such spatial patterns in the SST trend. We find that zonal
   band structures form in a flat rectangular coastline model, and heat
   budget analysis shows that horizontal heat transport, due to
   throughflow, reduces the warming effect created by the surface heat
   flux. A weak SST trend appears around the jet, while a strong SST trend
   appears elsewhere. Bathymetric effects are also examined using a model
   with realistic coastline settings. The location of the western boundary
   current stabilizes, and the coastal branch begins to disconnect from the
   Japanese coastline toward the north, allowing a more stable SST warming
   region to form in the southern interior region. Lagrangian particle
   tracking experiments confirm that a weak (strong) SST trend corresponds
   to a short (long) residence time, and eddies in the Japan Sea prolong
   the residence time in interior regions. The model results suggest that
   the accumulation time of surface heating is essential to the spatial
   distribution of the long-term SST warming trend.},

Abstract = {In this study, the simulation results of temperature by regional climate
   model (RegCM4) over South Korea were corrected by Hempel et al. (2013)'s
   method (Hempel method), and evaluated with the observation data of 50
   stations from Korea Meteorological Administration. Among the 30 years
   (1981 similar to 2010) of simulation data, 20 years (1981 similar to
   2000) of simulation data were used as a training data, and the remnant
   10 years (2001 similar to 2010) data were used for the evaluation of
   correction. In general, the Hempel method and parametric quantile
   mapping show a reasonable correction both in mean and extreme climate of
   temperature. As the results, the systematic underestimation of mean
   temperature was greatly reduced after bias correction by Hempel method.
   And the overestimation of extreme climate, such as the number of TN5\%
   and freezing day, was significantly recovered. In addition to that, the
   Hempel method better preserved the temporal trend of simulated
   temperature than other bias correction methods, such as the quantile
   mapping. However, the overcorrection of the extreme climate related to
   the upper quantile, such as TX5\% and hot days, resulted in the
   exaggeration of the simulation errors. In general, the Hempel method can
   reduce the systematic biases embedded in the simulation results
   preserving the temporal trend but it tends to overcorrect the non-linear
   biases, in particular, extreme climate related to the upper percentile.},

Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Sixteen temperature minimum and maximum series arc used to quantify
   annual and seasonal changes in temperature means and extremes over
   Georgia (Southern Caucasus) during the period 1961 and 2010. Along with
   trends in mean minimum and maximum temperature, eight indices are
   selected from the list of climate extreme indices as defined by the
   Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) of the
   Commission for Climatology of the World Meteorological Organization
   (WMO), for studying trends in temperature extremes. Between the analysis
   periods 1961-2010, 1971-2010 and 1981-2010 pronounced warming trends are
   determined for all Georgia-averaged trends in temperature means and
   extremes, while all magnitudes of trends increase towards the most
   recent period. During 1981 and 2010, significant warming trends for
   annual minimum and maximum temperature at a rate of 0.39 degrees C (0.47
   degrees C) days/decade and particularly for the warm temperature
   extremes, summer days, warm days and nights and the warm spell duration
   index are evident, whereas warm extremes show larger trends than cold
   extremes. The most pronounced trends are determined for summer clays 62
   days/decade, while the warm spell duration index indicates an increase
   in the occurrence of warm spells by 5.4 days/decade during 1981 and
   2010. in the comparison of seasonal changes in temperature means and
   extremes, the largest magnitudes of warming trends can be observed for
   temperature maximum in summer and temperature minimum in fall. Between
   1981 and 2010, summer maximum temperature shows a significant warming at
   a rate of 0.84 degrees C/decade, increasing almost twice as fast as its
   annual trend (047 degrees C/decade). The Georgia-averaged trends for
   temperature minimum in fall increase by 0.59 degrees C/clecade.
   Strongest significant trends in temperature extremes are identified
   during 1981 and 2010 for warm nights (4.6 days/decade) in summer and
   fall as well as for warm days (5.6 days/decade) in summer. Analyses
   demonstrate that there have been increasing warming trends since the
   1960s, particularly for warm extremes during summer and fall season,
   accompanied by a constant wamiing of temperature means in Georgia. (C)

Title = {Ensemble spread and its implication for the evaluation of temperature
   trends from multiple radiosondes and reanalyses products},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {37},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Based on the ensemble spread, a methodology of measuring uncertainty in
   weather forecasts, the temperature trend and spread have been estimated
   using five radiosonde data sets and seven reanalysis products beginning
   in 1989. The results show that the magnitude of warming or cooling
   depends on the data sources, atmospheric heights, and geophysical
   latitudes. Over low-middle latitudes, the cooling varies from -2.6
   K/decade in NCEP-DOE to -0.8 K/decade in HADAT2 in the lower
   stratosphere. The warming weakly changes from 0.2 through 0.4 K/decade
   in the middle troposphere. Over Antarctica, there is a pronounced
   warming in the low-middle troposphere in the three NCEP reanalyses and
   the RATPAC radiosonde data sets, and cooling in the other eight
   products. Over the Arctic, the warming is observed from the lower
   troposphere to the lower stratosphere in all twelve data sets.
   Significant cooling is identified over the middle stratosphere (above 50
   hPa) in all five radiosondes. For global mean temperature, the trend is
   approximately 0.2 K/decade in the troposphere and -0.8 K/decade in the
   stratosphere. The spread increases significantly with atmospheric height
   from approximately 0.1 K/decade at 850hPa to 0.8 K/decade at 30hPa. The
   spread in the reanalysis data sets is much larger than in the
   radiosondes in the stratosphere. In contrast, the spread in both the
   reanalysis and radiosondes data sets is very small and shows the trend
   in better agreement with each other in the troposphere. Citation: Xu,

Title = {Changes of Diurnal Temperature Range in Taiwan and Their Large-Scale
   Associations: Univariate and Multivariate Trend Analyses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {88},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {By analyzing the long-term (1950-2007) variability of diurnal
   temperature range {[}DTR; daytime maximum (T-max) minus nighttime
   minimum (T-min)] at 21 stations in Taiwan, this study applies univariate
   analysis, a trend-free prewhitening procedure combined with a modified
   Mann-Kendall test, and EOF-based multivariate trend analysis (TEOFA) to
   the ranked station DTR, T-max, and T-min. To reveal the large-scale
   associations with the local TEOFA results, this study also uses global
   gridded T-max, T-min, nighttime marine air temperature, and sea level
   pressure (SLP) datasets archived at the U.K. Meteorological Office
   Hadley Centre. On the basis of the signs and relative magnitudes between
   the annually-mean T-max, and T-min trends, the stations can be
   classified into three types through univariate analysis. With a common
   increasing T-min, type-A (type-B) stations have an increasing T-min
   (T-max) faster than T-max (T-min) whereas type-C stations have a
   decreasing T-max. Both type-A and type-C (type-B) thus show(s) a
   decreasing (an increasing) DTR. For most stations, the increasing T-min
   is the largest in December-February. In contrast, all type-B stations
   have an increasing T-max, peaking in June-August. Noticeably, six of
   nine type-B stations, either in the remote islands or in the seaports,
   are particularly influenced by the ocean. Three DTR trend modes stand
   out of TEOFA. The first mode, TEOF1, captures increasing DTR trends at
   four type-B stations and decreasing DTR trends elsewhere. The associated
   increasing T-min (T-max) trend is consistent with the increasing
   (decreasing) clouds during nighttime (daytime) and is well-correlated
   with the large-scale patterns, suggesting that it is part of the global
   warming scenario. Nevertheless, TEOF1 also captures a decreasing T-max
   trend in Taiwan's highly developed western plains (i.e., type C) and
   eastern China where an increasing SLP pattern is observed, implying the
   anthropogenic forcings on DTR. TEOF2 (TEOF3) depicts the
   decadal-to-interdecadal DTR variability in central (northern) Taiwan.
   Evolution of TEOF2 shows smaller (larger) amplitude before 1970s (after
   mid-1980s). The associated large-scale patterns suggest that TEOF2
   (TEOF3) captures the relationship between an intensified (weakened) East
   Asian winter monsoon and La Nina (El Nino)-like condition in eastern
   (central) equatorial Pacific. Embedded in a Pacific-Japan-like
   teleconnection pattern, the southwestward intrusion of Pacific
   subtropical anticyclone in June August that signifies the weakened
   southwesterly monsoon is also depicted by TEOF2.},

Abstract = {Urbanization-related growth and development have been recognized as
   substantial factors in increasing surface temperatures. India's rapid
   urbanization has exacerbated climate change challenges, particularly the
   rising Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Urban Heat Island (UHI)
   phenomena. The study used LST data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to examine decadal variances in LST and
   diurnal LST variations over the summer months in a study region. We
   compared the LST values in 2010, 2020, and 2022 with the reference year
   2000 by analyzing LST data collected from 2000 to 2022 using geospatial
   analysis. The study found a significant increase in the LST over a
   two-decade period, particularly in May and June, with temperature jumps
   of up to 10 (degrees C) both during the day and at night. The study also
   revealed differences in LST patterns between rural and urban regions,
   with rural areas having a higher daytime LST than urban areas and urban
   areas witnessing an elevated nighttime LST owing to the UHI impact.
   Analysis revealed significant differences in LST patterns, with 2020
   showing lower surface temperatures due to limited heat released from
   anthropogenic activities such as industrial operation and vehicular
   traffic due to the COVID-19 lockdown. However, in the years 2010 and
   2022, the study observed a significant increase in LST during the summer
   months both during the day and at night. These findings provided useful
   insights for urban development and planning and contribute to the
   implementation of measures aimed at reducing heat-related risks and
   improving the well-being of urban residents.},

Abstract = {Under global climate change, the change in temperature has greatly
   affected the hydrological processes and water resource security in the
   source region of the Yellow River, which is located in the Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau and serves as a major source of domestic and agricultural water
   supply in the watershed. Multiple spatiotemporal analysis methods,
   including the S-mode empirical orthogonal function analysis, the inverse
   distance weighted interpolation, the weighted moving average method, and
   the Mann-Kendall test method were used to comprehensively analyze the
   temperatures of 14 meteorological stations at yearly and seasonal scales
   from 1961 to 2010. The results indicated that (1) general trends of
   temperature change have been rising, with an especially significant
   warming trend since the late 1990s; (2) in the last five decades,
   temperature trends in the study area underwent three stages, namely a
   cool stage (approximately 1961-1980), a fluctuating stage (approximately
   1981-1997), and a warm stage (approximately 1998-2010); and (3) due to
   the combined effects of monsoons and geographic features, the source
   region could be divided into three zones according to the annual
   temperature variations: a low-value zone centered on Henan station in
   the northeastern edge; a high-value zone situated in the central,
   southern, and western area; and a transitional zone between the two
   zones mentioned above. This study is helpful for understanding
   temperature trends under climate change and can provide a basis for
   ecological protection.},

Title = {The influence of surface versus free-air decoupling on temperature trend
   patterns in the western United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {We analyzed temperature trends from 460 GHCNv2 weather stations in the
   western United States for 1948-2006 to determine whether the extent of
   decoupling of surface temperatures from the free atmosphere influences
   past change. At each location we derived monthly indices representative
   of anticyclonicity using NCEP/NCAR 700 hPa reanalysis pressure fields.
   The number of anticyclonic days minus cyclonic days (A-C) is positively
   correlated with temperature anomalies at exposed convex sites and in the
   north of the domain where the free atmosphere controls temperature,
   anticyclonic months being warmer. In topographic concavities, and in the
   south of the domain where the influence of upper air ridges and troughs
   is muted, the relationship is much weaker. We use the gradient of the
   A-C index-temperature relationship to represent a coupling index,
   highest at exposed free-air locations. On a mean annual basis there are
   no strong relationships between temperature trend magnitude, elevation,
   topographic incision, or coupling index. However, in winter, warming is
   weaker at decoupled locations, especially when snow cover is present.
   Where snow is absent in winter, and in fall, the relationship is
   reversed. Circulation changes (increased cyclonicity) can explain the
   disparity in warming between decoupled and exposed locations in fall and
   to a certain extent in winter (increased anticyclonicity), although
   winter results are also regionally sensitive. Thus, future climate
   change may be different (amplified or muted dependent on season and/or
   surface characteristics) in locations prone to surface decoupling,
   compared with locations exposed to the free atmosphere. Understanding
   such processes will aid downscaling of future climate change.},

Abstract = {Recently, the USNRC has proposed a Voluntary alternative to the
   pressurized thermal shock (PTS) rule (10CFR50.61(a)) that may be used
   instead of the existing PTS rule (10CFR50.61) by power reactor licensees
   to demonstrate the safety of their RPVs. The reference temperature (RT)
   screening limits in 10CFR50.61(a) are less restrictive than those of
   10CFR50.61; this relaxation being justified by the much more realistic
   models that underlie the technical basis of the revised rule. One of the
   many models that constitute this technical basis is used to estimate the
   effect of irradiation damage on the fracture toughness transition
   temperature. This relationship, which is called the embrittlement trend
   curve, or ETC, can change as time goes on due to the continued
   development of new knowledge (e.g., from on-going reactor vessel
   surveillance programs. from test reactor studies aimed at better
   understanding the physical mechanisms of irradiation damage, etc.). In
   this paper we present information that quantifies the effect of
   different ETCs on the through wall cracking frequencies that are
   calculated using the probabilistic fracture mechanics computer code that
   was used to establish the RT limits that have been proposed in
   10CFR50.61(a)},

Title = {Evaluating warming trend over the tibetan plateau based on remotely
   sensed air temperature from 2001 to 2020},

Abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP), the Third Pole of the world, has experienced
   significant warming over the past several decades. Previous studies have
   mostly relied on station-observed air temperature (Ta), reanalysis data,
   and remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) to analyze the
   warming trend over the TP. However, the uneven distribution of stations,
   the poor spatial resolution of reanalysis data, and the differences
   between LST and Ta may lead to biased warming rates. This paper first
   maps Ta over the TP from 2001 to 2020 based on multi-source remote
   sensing data, and then quantifies the spatio-temporal variations of
   remotely sensed Ta and elevation dependent warming (EDW) of this region.
   The monthly mean Ta is estimated using machine learning (ML) method year
   by year, and its accuracy is validated based on station-observed Ta. The
   coefficient of determination (R2 ranges from 0.97 to 0.98 and the mean
   absolute error (MAE) ranges from 1.01 to1.04 degrees C. The remotely
   sensed Ta is used to analysis warming trend and EDW over the TP. The
   overall warming trend of the TP during 2001-2020 is 0.17 degree
   celsius/10a, and warming mainly distributed in the eastern TP, central
   TP and western Kunlun Mountains. Among the four seasons, autumn shows
   the most significant warming, tripling the annual warming rate. Winter
   shows a significant cooling trend, with the warming rate of -0.18 degree
   celsius/10a. The study also reveales the existence of EDW at both the
   annual and seasonal scales. This paper suggests the potential of
   remotely sensed Ta in global warming study, and also provides an
   improved understanding of climate warming over the TP.},

Title = {Intercomparison of Local Warming Trends of Shanghai and Hong Kong Based

Abstract = {Using surface air temperature observations from 1901 to 2020, this study
   compared the warming trends of Shanghai and Hong Kong over a period of
   120 years. The statistical results reveal the following: (1) The average
   temperatures of the two cities underwent fluctuating increases during
   the past 120 years, with linear warming rates of 0.23 degrees C/decade
   in Shanghai and 0.13 degrees C/decade in Hong Kong. (2) The fluctuation
   ranges of maximum temperature in the two cities were considerably higher
   than those of mean temperature. Moreover, in both cities, the annual
   mean maximum temperature decreased during a phase of more than a decade.
   The fluctuation ranges of minimum temperature were smaller, whereas the
   linear increases were higher than those for the mean temperature. (3)
   The diurnal temperature ranges (DTRs) of the two cities decreased; a
   certain phase of the decreases in DTR in the two cities was caused by
   decreases in the maximum temperature. (4) At a certain stage of urban
   development, owing to the shading effect of new high-rise buildings, the
   solar shortwave radiation reaching the Earth's surface decreased, and
   anthropogenic heat generated by the energy consumption of buildings and
   urban human activities at that time was not sufficient to make up for
   the reduced shortwave radiation. This result may have led to the
   declines in the maximum temperature experienced by both cities. (5)
   Currently, the number of hot days and extremely hot days in the two
   cities has increased significantly compared with that a century ago,
   indicating that climate warming has an adverse impact on human
   settlements.},

Title = {Internal variability in multidecadal trends of surface air temperature
   over antarctica in austral winter in model simulations},

Abstract = {The surface air temperature (SAT) exhibits pronounced warming over West
   Antarctica in recent decades, especially in austral spring and winter.
   Using a 30-member ensemble of simulations by Community Earth System
   Model (CESM), two reanalysis datasets, and observed station data, this
   study investigates the relative contributions of internally generated
   low-frequency climate variability and externally forced climate change
   to the austral winter SAT trend in Antarctica. Although these
   simulations share the same external forcing, the SAT trends during
   1979-2005 show large diversity among the individual members in the CESM
   ensemble simulations, suggesting that internally generated variability
   contributes a considerable part to the multidecadal SAT change in
   Antarctica. Quantitatively, the total forced contribution to the SAT
   (1979-2005) change is about 0.53 k/27 yr, and the internal variability
   can be strong enough to double or cancel the externally forced warming
   trend. A method called ``dynamical adjustment{''} is utilized to further
   divide the forced response. We find both the forced
   thermodynamically-induced and the forced dynamically-induced SAT trends
   are positive over all the regions in Antarctica, with the regional mean
   values of 0.20 k /27 yr and 0.33 k/27 yr, respectively. The diversity of
   SAT trends among the simulations is closely linked to a Southern
   hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM)-like atmospheric circulation multidecadal
   change in the Southern Hemisphere. When there exists a positive-negative
   seesaw of pressure trend between Antarctica and the mid-latitudes, the
   SAT trend is positive over most of Antarctica but negative over the
   Antarctic Peninsula, and vice versa. The SAM-like atmospheric
   circulation multidecadal change mainly arises from atmospheric internal
   variability rather than remote tropical Sea Surface Temperature (SST).},

Abstract = {The increase of air surface temperature at global scale is a fact with
   values around 0.85 A degrees C since the late nineteen century.
   Nevertheless, the increase is not equally distributed all over the
   world, varying from one region to others. Thus, it becomes interesting
   to study the evolution of temperature indices for a certain area in
   order to analyse the existence of climatic trend in it. In this work,
   monthly temperature time series from two Mediterranean areas are used:
   the Umbria region in Italy, and the Guadalquivir Valley in southern
   Spain. For the available stations, six temperature indices (three annual
   and three monthly) of mean, average maximum and average minimum
   temperature have been obtained, and the existence of trends has been
   studied by applying the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. Both regions
   show a general increase in all temperature indices, being the pattern of
   the trends clearer in Spain than in Italy. The Italian area is the only
   one at which some negative trends are detected. The presence of break
   points in the temperature series has been also studied by using the
   non-parametric Pettit test and the parametric standard normal
   homogeneity test (SNHT), most of which may be due to natural phenomena.},

Volume = {115},

Abstract = {Daily minimum temperature (Tmin) and maximum temperature (Tmax) data of
   Huairou station in Beijing from 1960 to 2008 are examined and adjusted
   for inhomogeneities by applying the data of two nearby reference
   stations. Urban effects on the linear trends of the original and
   adjusted temperature series are estimated and compared. Results show
   that relocations of station cause obvious discontinuities in the data
   series, and one of the discontinuities for Tmin are highly significant
   when the station was moved from downtown to suburb in 1996. The daily
   Tmin and Tmax data are adjusted for the inhomogeneities. The mean annual
   Tmin and Tmax at Huairou station drop by 1.377A degrees C and 0.271A
   degrees C respectively after homogenization. The adjustments for Tmin
   are larger than those for Tmax, especially in winter, and the seasonal
   differences of the adjustments are generally more obvious for Tmin than
   for Tmax. Urban effects on annual mean Tmin and Tmax trends are -0.004A
   degrees C/10 year and -0.035A degrees C/10 year respectively for the
   original data, but they increase to 0.388A degrees C/10 year and 0.096A
   degrees C/10 year respectively for the adjusted data. The increase is
   more significant for the annual mean Tmin series. Urban contributions to
   the overall trends of annual mean Tmin and Tmax reach 100\% and 28.8\%
   respectively for the adjusted data. Our analysis shows that data
   homogenization for the stations moved from downtowns to suburbs can lead
   to a significant overestimate of rising trends of surface air
   temperature, and this necessitates a careful evaluation and adjustment
   for urban biases before the data are applied in analyses of local and
   regional climate change.},

   recently in nature. Here, we find that the magnitude of the cloud-SST
   feedback in the subtropical Southeast Pacific is correlated across
   models with the magnitude of Eastern Pacific multi-decadal SST
   variability. A heat-budget analysis reveals coupling between
   cloud-radiative effects, circulation, and SST gradients in driving
   multi-decadal variability in the Eastern Pacific. Using this
   relationship and observed feedback estimates, we find that internal
   Eastern Pacific SST variability is underestimated in most models.
   Adjusting for model bias increases the likelihood of generating a
   cooling trend at least as large as observations in preindustrial control
   simulations by similar to \$\{\textbackslash{}sim\} \$56\% on average.
   If models underestimate climate ``noise,{''} as our results suggest,
   this bias should be accounted for when attributing the relative
   importance of forced versus unforced changes in the climate.
   In recent decades, observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have cooled
   in the eastern tropical Pacific and warmed in the western tropical
   Pacific. Historical simulations using state-of-the-art climate models
   fail to reproduce this pattern. We find that the feedback between
   low-lying clouds and SSTs is related to the magnitude of naturally
   occurring SST variability in the Southeast Pacific. On average, climate
   models that have too weak a cloud-SST feedback in the Southeast Pacific
   underestimate the likelihood of multi-decadal cooling in the eastern
   Pacific in preindustrial simulations. Our results suggest that biases in
   cloud feedbacks may be causing models to underestimate internal SST
   variability.
   Multi-decadal Southeast Pacific sea surface temperature trends are
   related to the strength of the subtropical cloud feedback Cloud
   radiative effects amplify multi-decadal Pacific sea surface temperature
   trends by impacting circulation and surface energy fluxes Correcting
   model biases in cloud feedback raises the likelihood of internally
   producing Southeast Pacific cooling as large as observations},

Abstract = {In the global lands, the bias of urbanization effects still exits in the
   surface air temperature series of many city weather stations to a
   certain extent. Reliable reference climate stations need to be selected
   for the detection and correction of the local manmade warming bias. The
   underlying image data of remote sensing retrieval is adopted in this
   study to obtain the spatial distribution of surface brightness
   temperature, and the surface air temperature reference stations are
   determined based on the locations of the weather stations in the remote
   sensing surface thermal fields. Among the 672 national reference climate
   stations and national basic weather stations of mainland China, for
   instance, 113 surface air temperature reference stations are selected
   for applying this method. Compared with the average surface air
   temperature series of the reference stations obtained by a more
   sophisticated method developed in China, this method is proven to be
   robust and applicable, and can be adopted for the evaluation and
   adjustment study on the urbanization bias of the currently used air
   temperature records of surface climate stations in the global lands.},

Title = {Signals of anthropogenic influence on European warming as seen in the
   trend patterns of daily temperature variance},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Signals of anthropogenic warming over Europe are searched for in the
   spatial trend patterns for the variance and skewness (expressed by the
   10th and 90th percentiles) of the distribution of daily mean
   temperature. Comparisons are made between these patterns in the station
   records of the European Climate Assessment dataset for the 1976-99
   period, the patterns associated with natural variability in the
   observations (which were empirically derived from the observations in
   the 1946-75 period), and the patterns of future warming and natural
   variability as simulated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research
   Community Climate System Model in the Challenge ensemble experiment.
   The results indicate that, on the basis of the patterns for the
   variance, a distinction can be made between temperature change due to
   natural variability and temperature change due to changes in external
   forcing. The observed variance trend patterns for the spring (March-May)
   and summer (June-August) warming 1976-99 are clearly different from the
   patterns for the change in variance associated with a warming due to
   natural variability in the observations. This led us to conclude that a
   change in an external forcing has to be invoked to explain the observed
   spring and summer warming. From the evaluation of the greenhouse and
   natural variability patterns in the climate model simulations, we infer
   that the observed spring and summer variance trend patterns contain
   imprints consistent with anthropogenic warming. The analysis of the
   variance trend patterns for the winter (December-February) season is
   inconclusive about identifying causes of the observed warming for that
   season. Unlike the other three seasons, the autumn (September-November)
   is for Europe a period of cooling in recent decades. The observed
   variance trend pattern for this season closely resembles the estimated
   pattern for the change in variance associated with a cooling due to
   natural variability, indicating that the observed autumn cooling can be
   ascribed to random weather variations in the period under consideration.

Abstract = {Recent observations of a decreasing ice extent and a possible thinning
   of the ice cover in the Arctic make it imperative that detailed studies
   of the current Arctic environment are made, especially since the region
   is known to be highly sensitive to a potential change in climate. A
   continuous dataset of microwave, thermal infrared and visible satellite
   data has been analyzed for the first time to concurrently study, in
   spatial detail the variability of the sea-ice cover, surface
   temperature, albedo and cloud statistics in the region from 1987 to
   1998. Large warming anomalies during the last four years (i.e. 1995-98)
   are indeed apparent and spatially more extensive than previous years.
   The largest surface temperature anomaly occurred in 1998, but this was
   confined mainly to the western Arctic and the North American continent,
   while cooling occurred in other areas. The albedo anomalies show good
   coherence with the sea-ice concentration anomalies except in the central
   region, where periodic changes in albedo are observed, indicative of
   inter-annual changes in duration and areal extent of melt ponding and
   snow-free ice cover. The cloud-cover anomalies are more difficult to
   interpret, but are shown to be well correlated with the expected warming
   effects of clouds on the sea-ice surface. The results from trend
   analyses of the data are consistent with a general warming trend and an
   ice-cover retreat that appear to be even larger during the last dozen
   years than those previously reported.},

Abstract = {This study characterizes the spatial patterns of the overall and monthly
   trends in sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) of the
   Gulf of Mexico (GoM) to investigate the seasonal variations in oceanic
   climate trends. We also investigate the trends in mesoscale eddies using
   three parameters to identify ocean-eddy-related energetic features in
   their area, strength, and intensity. Multidecadal remote-sensing-based
   observations of monthly SST, Chl-a, and sea surface height are used to
   detect trends at both basin and grid scales. Prominent warming trends
   are found in most regions of the GoM in all months, with the largest
   trends in the northern GoM. Winter cooling trends are also detected
   along the Texas and Florida coast. The overall summer warming trend
   (similar to 0.22 degrees C/decade) is larger than the winter trend
   (similar to 0.05 degrees C/decade), suggesting seasonal variations of
   increase in SST with warming. Chl-a trends and variations are confined
   on the continental shelf and slope in the northern GoM. The largest
   increase trends are found near the Mississippi River Delta. No obvious
   Chl-a trend is detected in the deepwater of the GoM, consistent with
   previous studies. Small but significant changes are found in eddy
   characteristics, indicating the eddy activities might be slowly affected
   by climate change in the GoM. The detailed monthly trends at per-grid
   scale are valuable for regional resource management, environmental
   protection, and policy making in the GoM.},

Title = {Temperature change as a driver of spatial patterns and long-term trends

Journal = {GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have led to a global decline in biodiversity,
   and monitoring studies indicate that both insect communities and wetland
   ecosystems are particularly affected. However, there is a need for
   long-term data (over centennial or millennial timescales) to better
   understand natural community dynamics and the processes that govern the
   observed trends. Chironomids (Insecta: Diptera: Chironomidae) are often
   the most abundant insects in lake ecosystems, sensitive to environmental
   change, and, because their larval exoskeleton head capsules preserve
   well in lake sediments, they provide a unique record of insect community
   dynamics through time. Here, we provide the results of a metadata
   analysis of chironomid diversity across a range of spatial and temporal
   scales. First, we analyse spatial trends in chironomid diversity using
   Northern Hemispheric data sets overall consisting of 837 lakes. Our
   results indicate that in most of our data sets, summer temperature
   (T-jul) is strongly associated with spatial trends in modern-day
   chironomid diversity. We observe a strong increase in chironomid alpha
   diversity with increasing T-jul in regions with present-day T-jul
   between 2.5 and 14 degrees C. In some areas with T-jul > 14 degrees C,
   chironomid diversity stabilizes or declines. Second, we demonstrate that
   the direction and amplitude of change in alpha diversity in a
   compilation of subfossil chironomid records spanning the last
   glacial-interglacial transition (similar to 15,000-11,000 years ago) are
   similar to those observed in our modern data. A compilation of Holocene
   records shows that during phases when the amplitude of temperature
   change was small, site-specific factors had a greater influence on the
   chironomid fauna obscuring the chironomid diversity-temperature
   relationship. Our results imply expected overall chironomid diversity
   increases in colder regions such as the Arctic under sustained global
   warming, but with complex and not necessarily predictable responses for
   individual sites.},

Abstract = {The generation of quality climatic series is the first step in the
   analysis of climate characteristics and behaviour in any region of the
   world. This article approaches the construction of homogeneous average
   temperature series for the period 1982-2011, for the study of spatial
   distribution and temporal evolution in the Province of Santa Elena, in
   the most western point of continental Ecuador in South America. Despite
   the low variability registered in the temperatures of the Province,
   these were higher and more homogeneous in the inland region than on the
   coast and almost 3 degrees C higher in the trimesters of the rainy
   season December-January-February (DJF) and March-April-May (MAM) than in
   the trimesters of the dry season June-July-August (JJA) and
   September-October-November (SON). Trend analysis detected positive
   increasing rates for the temperature of the province, with values three
   times higher during DJF and MAM in comparison with SON and annual
   average trend of 0.33 degrees C decade(-1) in the region. The
   construction of homogeneous average temperature series in the Province
   of Santa Elena has been an important step towards the spatial-temporal
   characterization of this peculiar climatic zone. These series can also
   be employed as base scenarios for the development of climate change
   studies in the region.},

Title = {Uncertainty estimation of the global temperature trends for multiple
   radiosondes, reanalyses, and CMIP3/IPCC climate model simulations},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {108},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {505-518},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Based on three groups of datasets that include radiosondes, reanalyses,
   and climate model simulations (e.g., Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project, CMIP3) from 1979 to 2008, the interannual variability, global
   temperature trends, and their uncertainty using ensemble spread among
   intra-group and inter-group datasets have been discussed. The results
   show that the interannual temperature variability increased from the
   troposphere to stratosphere, and the maximum occurs around 50 hPa. The
   CMIP3 climate models have the largest discrepancy in the stratosphere.
   The intra-group correlations at 500 hPa generally show high similarity
   within each data group while the inter-group correlations between
   reanalyses and the CMIP3 climate model simulations indicate lesser
   similarity. In contrast, the inter-group correlation at 50 hPa is
   improved except with the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis Project (JRA-25)
   dataset, and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) reanalysis shows a
   weak cross correlation. The global temperature trends are highly
   dependent on the individual data sources. Compared to the radiosondes,
   the reanalyses show a large ensemble spread of trends in the
   stratosphere, and the CMIP3 climate model simulations have a large
   ensemble spread in the height of the crossover point where tropospheric
   warming changes into stratospheric cooling. The largest ensemble spread
   among the reanalyses in the stratosphere is mainly from the large
   discrepancy in the JRA-25 reanalysis after 1998 and a relatively weak
   anomaly in the 20CR before 1986. The largest ensemble spread among the
   CMIP3 climate models in the troposphere is related to the influence of
   both volcanic eruptions and El Nio/La Nia-Southern Oscillation events.
   The strong anomalies corresponding to the volcanic eruptions of El
   Chichon in 1982 and Mt Pinatubo in 1991 are clearly identified in the
   stratosphere. These volcanic eruptions reduced the warming in the
   troposphere and strengthened the cooling in the stratosphere during the
   most recent 30 years.},

Title = {Recent Near-surface Temperature Trends in the Antarctic Peninsula from

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {This study investigates the recent near-surface temperature trends over
   the Antarctic Peninsula. We make use of available surface observations,
   ECMWF's ERA5 and its predecessor ERA-Interim, as well as numerical
   simulations, allowing us to contrast different data sources. We use
   hindcast simulations performed with Polar-WRF over the Antarctic
   Peninsula on a nested domain configuration at 45 km (PWRF-45) and 15 km
   (PWRF-15) spatial resolutions for the period 1991-2015. In addition, we
   include hindcast simulations of KNMI-RACMO21P obtained from the
   CORDEX-Antarctica domain (similar to 50 km) for further comparisons.
   Results show that there is a marked windward warming trend except during
   summer. This windward warming trend is particularly notable in the
   autumn season and likely to be associated with the recent deepening of
   the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea low and warm advection towards the
   Antarctic Peninsula. On the other hand, an overall summer cooling is
   characterized by the strengthening of the Weddell Sea low as well as an
   anticyclonic trend over the Amundsen Sea accompanied by northward winds.
   The persistent cooling trend observed at the Larsen Ice Shelf station is
   not captured by ERA-Interim, whereas hindcast simulations indicate that
   there is a clear pattern of windward warming and leeward cooling.
   Furthermore, larger temporal correlations and lower differences
   exhibited by PWRF-15 illustrate the existence of the added value in the
   higher spatial resolution simulation.},

Abstract = {We examine the 1979-2014 Southern Ocean (SO) sea surface temperature
   (SST) trends simulated in an ensemble of coupled general circulation
   models and evaluate possible causes of the models' inability to
   reproduce the observed 1979-2014 SO cooling. For each model we estimate
   the response of SO SST to step changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing
   and in the seasonal indices of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Using
   these step-response functions, we skillfully reconstruct the models'
   1979-2014 SO SST trends. Consistent with the seasonal signature of the
   Antarctic ozone hole and the seasonality of SO stratification, the
   summer and fall SAM exert a large impact on the simulated SO SST trends.
   We further identify conditions that favor multidecadal SO cooling: (1) a
   weak SO warming response to GHG forcing, (2) a strong multidecadal SO
   cooling response to a positive SAM trend, and (3) a historical SAM trend
   as strong as in observations.},

Title = {Comparison of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature variability and

Abstract = {Coral Sr/Ca is widely used to reconstruct past ocean temperatures.
   However, some studies report different Sr/Ca-temperature relationships
   for conspecifics on the same reef, with profound implications for
   interpretation of reconstructed temperatures. We assess whether these
   differences are attributable to small-scale oceanographic variability or
   vital effects associated with coral calcification and quantify the
   effect of intercolony differences on temperature estimates and
   uncertainties. Sr/Ca records from four massive Porites colonies growing
   on the east and west sides of Jarvis Island, central equatorial Pacific,
   were compared with in situ logger temperatures spanning 2002-2012. In
   general, Sr/Ca captured the occurrence of interannual sea surface
   temperature events but their amplitude was not consistently recorded by
   any of the corals. No long-term trend was identified in the instrumental
   data, yet Sr/Ca of one coral implied a statistically significant cooling
   trend while that of its neighbor implied a warming trend. Slopes of
   Sr/Ca-temperature regressions from the four different colonies were
   within error, but offsets in mean Sr/Ca rendered the regressions
   statistically distinct. Assuming that these relationships represent the
   full range of Sr/Ca-temperature calibrations in Jarvis Porites, we
   assessed how well Sr/Ca of a nonliving coral with an unknown
   Sr/Ca-temperature relationship can constrain past temperatures. Our
   results indicate that standard error of prediction methods underestimate
   the actual error as we could not reliably reconstruct the amplitude or
   frequency of El Nino-Southern Oscillation events as large as 2 degrees
   C. Our results underscore the importance of characterizing the full
   range of temperature-Sr/Ca relationships at each study site to estimate
   true error.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the spatial patterns of atmospheric circulation
   associated with surface air temperature variability trends between the
   Antarctic Peninsula and South America, during the austral summer
   (1979-2020). The first mode shows a positive score trend, with warming
   in northern Antarctic Peninsula and southern South America. This mode is
   mainly associated with the positive/neutral Southern Annular Mode and La
   Nina phases. There is an anomalous low pressure in the Southeast
   Pacific, a strengthening (weakening) of the polar (subtropical) jet and
   a strengthening and/or south/southwest displacement of the South
   Atlantic Subtropical High, which can prevent the passage of transient
   systems over the continent. In addition, there is a negative phase
   pattern of the South Atlantic Dipole, which contributes to the
   strengthening of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone convective
   activity. The second mode shows a negative score trend, with cooling in
   the Antarctic Peninsula/southernmost South America and warming between
   10-40 degrees S over South America. This mode is mainly associated with
   the spatial pattern of Central Pacific El Nino. There is a strengthening
   of the low-level jet and a strengthening of the western branch of the
   South Atlantic Subtropical High, all of which contribute to the
   suppression of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone.},

Abstract = {We describe the recovery of three daily meteorological records for the
   southern Alps (Domodossola, Riva del Garda, and Rovereto), all starting
   in the second half of the nineteenth century. We use these new data,
   along with additional records, to study regional changes in the mean
   temperature and extreme indices of heat waves and cold spells frequency
   and duration over the period 1874-2015. The records are homogenized
   using subdaily cloud cover observations as a constraint for the
   statistical model, an approach that has never been applied before in the
   literature. A case study based on a record of parallel observations
   between a traditional meteorological window and a modern screen shows
   that the use of cloud cover can reduce the root-mean-square error of the
   homogenization by up to 30\% in comparison to an unaided statistical
   correction. We find that mean temperature in the southern Alps has
   increased by 1.4 degrees C per century over the analyzed period, with
   larger increases in daily minimum temperatures than maximum
   temperatures. The number of hot days in summer has more than tripled,
   and a similar increase is observed in duration of heat waves. Cold days
   in winter have dropped at a similar rate. These trends are mainly caused
   by climate change over the last few decades.},

Abstract = {Global radiation is a fundamental source of energy in the climate
   system. A significant impact of global radiation on temperature change
   is expected due to the widespread dimming/brightening phenomenon
   observed since the second half of the twentieth century. This work
   describes the analysis of 312 stations with sunshine duration (SD)
   series, a proxy for global radiation, and temperature series in the
   European Climate Assessment \& Dataset (ECA\&D) with data over the
   period 1961-2010. The relationship between SD and temperature series is
   analyzed for four temperature variables: maximum (T-max), minimum
   (T-min), mean temperature (T-mean), and diurnal temperature range (DTR).
   The analyses are performed on annual and seasonal basis. The results
   show strong positive correlations between SD and temperatures over
   Europe, with highest correlation for DTR and Tmax during the summer
   period. These results confirm the strong relationship between SD and
   temperature trends over Europe since the second half of the twentieth
   century. This study supports previous suggestions that dimming
   (brightening) has partially decreased (increased) temperatures thereby
   modulating the greenhouse gas induced warming rates over Europe.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},

Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Two methods, based on different assumptions, have been investigated for
   computing the uncertainty in the trend of 960 mesopause region
   temperature profiles taken over 20 years. In addition to the trend, the
   fitting model includes annual and semiannual variations, a solar effect,
   and an episodic term that can be associated with the Mount Pinatubo
   volcanic eruption. In our standard procedure we assume that the unknown
   uncertainties of each measurement, and thus the weights of the
   observations, are constant with time and are determined by assuming that
   we have a good model. In addition we investigate including second
   derivatives along with first derivatives of the Hessian matrix. In the
   Monte Carlo bootstrap method one resamples the data with replacement to
   obtain new data sets which are fit to the model and yield a distribution
   of fitting parameters. The standard deviation of the distribution for a
   parameter is taken to be the uncertainty in the parameter. A possible
   assumption to justify this method is that the data are ``independent and
   identically distributed.{''} Although we have not been able to justify
   the assumptions of either method, the two methods support each other
   since they give essentially the same results.},

Title = {Solar cycle signature and secular long-term trend in OH airglow
   temperature observations at South Pole, Antarctica},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS},
Year = {2007},

Abstract = {{[}1] We have examined Michelson Interferometer OH airglow temperature
   data to investigate solar cycle and long-term variations of mesospheric
   temperatures at South Pole Station (SPS), Antarctica (90 degrees S). The
   data set used here is continuous (24 hours a day) and taken during
   1994-2004 austral winters. We have used a Multiple Linear Regression
   (MLR) technique to elucidate solar cycle and the trend term in the MI
   temperature time series data. The 11-year time series of OH rotational
   temperature shows a strong correlation with F10.7 radio flux (R = 0.60).
   The amplitude of solar cycle response seen in the mesopause temperature
   records at South Pole is about 0.04 +/- 0.01 K/sfu (Solar Flux Units),
   however, the trend term is statistically insignificant and is about 0.1
   +/- 0.2 K/year. Superposed epoch studies have been carried out in order
   to determine climatological variations in OH temperatures above South
   Pole derived from 11 years of austral winter observations. The mean
   amplitude of this variation is about 12.6 K and its maximum occurs near
   30 May which is in agreement with the Fabry-Perot Spectrometer (FPS)
   observations of OH temperatures at SPS (Hernandez, 2003). However,
   whereas Hernandez (2003) reported 35 K cooling in 2002, MI OH
   temperatures at SPS do not show any significant deviation from previous
   years.},

Title = {Trend Decomposition for Temperature Compensation in a Radar-Based
   Structural Health Monitoring System of Wind Turbine Blades},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The compensation of temperature is critical in every structural health
   monitoring (SHM) system for achieving maximum damage detection
   performance. This paper analyses a novel approach based on seasonal
   trend decomposition to eliminate the temperature effect in a radar-based
   SHM system for wind turbine blades that operates in the frequency band
   from 58 to 63.5 GHz. While the original seasonal trend decomposition
   searches for the trend of a periodic signal in its entirety, the new
   method uses a moving average to determine trends for each point of a
   periodic signal. The points of the seasonal signal no longer need to
   have the same trend. Based on the determined trends, the measurement
   signal can be corrected by temperature effects, providing accurate
   damage detection results under changing temperature conditions. The
   performance of the trend decomposition is demonstrated with experimental
   data obtained during a full-scale fatigue test of a 31 m long wind
   turbine blade subjected to ambient temperature variations. For
   comparison, the well-known optimal baseline selection (OBS) approach is
   used, which is based on multiple baseline measurements at different
   temperature conditions. The use of metrics, such as the contrast in
   damage indicators, enables the performance assessment of both methods.},

Abstract = {We built a model for daily temperatures based on a seasonal functional
   heteroscedastic autoregressive model (SFHAR) and address also to
   extremes values, not taken in account in the literature concerning these

   seasonality components by both nonparametric and parametric methods.
   Then, we model the reduced series by a periodic-stationary
   (cycloperiodic) model. The seasonality remains in all the dynamics of
   reduced series and is important. On the other hand, we use the specific
   framework extreme theory for bounded diffusions corresponding to Weibull
   case to obtain the final estimate. The model is tested by simulations.

Abstract = {Biological processes in surface waters appreciably depend on temperature
   of water. This paper summarizes our investigations of water temperature
   in the Bela River. The Bela River is a mountainous stream not influenced
   by direct human activities, draining the headwaters of the Vah River
   basin in the Tatra National Park (TANAP), Slovakia. Our primary aim was
   to identify the long-term trends and multi-annual variability of the
   annual water temperature at the Podbanske gauging station, using
   temperature readings taken at 7.00 am for the period of 50 years
   (1959-2008). Long-term mean of the annual water temperature of the Bela
   River at the Podbanske gauging station (922 m a.s.l.) was 4.2 degrees C,
   the air temperature at Podbanske meteorological station (972 m a.s.l.)
   was 5.0 degrees C. Both, air and water temperature, show an increasing
   trend. While the air temperature within 50-years increased significantly
   by 1.5 degrees C, in the case of water temperature this increase was
   merely by 0.12 degrees C. On November 19, 2004, a wind-throw brushed the
   investigated area with an aftermath of 15.4\% destroyed forest in the
   Bela basin, mainly along the area adjacent to the river. Therefore, in
   the second part of the study, the impact of the riparian vegetation
   growing along the river banks was evaluated for two distinctive periods,
   i.e. the period prior and after the wind-throw. We statistically
   analysed the changes in water temperature on 6-year time series of daily
   water temperature (November 2001 through November 2007). The results
   presented herein may be useful for defining boundary values for surface
   water temperature, as required by the EC Water Framework Directive. (C)

Abstract = {Surface temperature trends during the last two decades show a
   significant increase which appears to be anthropogenic in origin. We
   investigate global temperature changes using surface as well as
   satellite measurements and show that lower tropospheric temperature
   trends for the period 1979-2001 are spatially correlated to
   anthropogenic surface CO2 emissions, which we use as a measure of
   industrialization. Furthermore, temperature trends for the regions not
   spatially correlated with these CO2 emissions are considerably smaller
   or even negligible for some of the satellite data. We also show, using
   the same measure, that two important climate models do not reproduce the
   geographical climate response to all known forcings as found in the
   observed temperature trends. We speculate that the observed surface
   temperature changes might be a result of local surface heating processes
   and not related to radiative greenhouse gas forcing.},

Abstract = {The 1221 weather observation stations that compose the U.S. Historical
   Climatology Network were designated as either urban, suburban, or rural
   based on data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
   Operational Linescan System (OLS). The designations were based on local
   and regional samples of the OLS data around the stations (OLS method).
   Trends in monthly maximum and minimum temperature and the diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) were determined for the 1950-96 interval for
   each of three land use/land cover (LULC) designations. The temperature
   trends for the OLS-derived designations of LULC were compared to
   similarly designated LULC based on (i) map- (Operational Navigation
   Charts) and population-based estimates of LULC (ONCP method), and (ii)
   LULC designations that resulted from of a survey of the network station
   operators. Although differences were not statistically significant, the
   DTR trends (degrees Celsius per 100 years)did differ between the LULC
   classes defined by the OLS method, from -0.41 for the rural stations to
   -0.86 for the urban stations. Trends also differed, although not
   significantly, between the methods used to define an LULC class, such
   that the trends in rural DTR varied from -0.41 for the OLS defined
   stations to -0.67 for the ONCP defined stations. Although the trends
   between classes were not significantly different, they do present some
   contrasts that might confound the interpretation of temperature trends
   when the local and regional environments associated with the analyzed
   stations are not considered. The general (urban, suburban, or rural)
   LULC associated with surface observation stations appears to be one of
   the factors that can influence the trends observed in temperatures and
   thus should be considered in the analysis and interpretation of

Abstract = {The temperature-related growth characteristics of Microcystis sp. and
   its competitor Cyclotella meneghiniana were examined in a series of
   monoculture experiments at six different temperatures. Then, the
   temperature-related term of each species was established for a
   previously developed interspecific competition model, which can not be
   applied in actual lakes due to the lack of temperature-related terms.
   Based on experimental results, the highest temperature-dependent growth
   rate for C. meneghiniana was calculated to be 0.64 day(-1) at 29 degrees
   C and that for Microcystis sp. was 0.65 day(-1) at 37 degrees C. The
   coefficient epsilon, which reflects the extent of the biovolume change
   affected by temperature, was 19.4 for C. meneghiniana and 8.7 for
   Microcystis sp., indicating that C. meneghiniana is more sensitive to
   the temperature than Microcystis sp. Moreover, cocultivation experiments
   at low temperature (20 degrees C) and high temperature (30 degrees C)
   were conducted to verify the influence of these temperature-dependent
   growth characteristics on the interspecific interaction. The biovolume
   in saturation and dominant species were portrayed in the two temperature
   groups to assess the effect of temperature on their interaction. This
   study also discussed the effect of temperature on Microcystis blooms
   formation by comparing experimental results with the observed situation
   in the field of Lake Tega.},

   Mean ion mass number manifests a negative trend at 175 km which should
   correspond to a negative trend in Ti contrary the results obtained below
   200 km with ISRs. Therefore, routine ISR observations based on a fixed

Abstract = {The trend in sea surface temperature has been determined from 20 yr of
   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Pathfinder data (version 5).
   The data span the period from January 1985 to December 2004, inclusive.
   The linear trends were calculated to be 0.18 degrees +/- 0.04 degrees
   and 0.17 degrees +/- 0.05 degrees C decade(-1) from daytime and
   nighttime data, respectively. However, the measured trends were found to
   be somewhat smaller if version 4.1 of the Pathfinder data was used, or
   if the time series of data ended earlier. The influence of El Nino on
   global temperatures can be seen clearly in the data. However, it was not
   found to affect the trend measurements significantly. Evidence of cool
   temperatures after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 was also
   observed.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {Several studies indicate that incident shortwave radiation at land
   surfaces has significantly decreased between 1960 and 1990. Despite
   this, land temperature has increased by 0.4degreesC over the same
   period. From a surface energy balance perspective, this counterintuitive
   behaviour can be resolved either 1) through an increase in the downward
   longwave radiation which outweighs the decreased insolation or 2)
   through a decrease of surface evaporation and associated reduced
   evaporative surface cooling. It is suggested that 1) may not be large
   enough, so that the available energy for evaporation may rather have
   decreased than increased over the period considered. This is in line
   with an analysis of observed surface net radiation records. The inferred
   decrease of evaporation would further imply that the observed
   intensification of the hydrological cycle over extratropical land has
   been more likely due to increased moisture advection from the oceans
   than due to increased local moisture release through evaporation.},

Abstract = {The presence of Vermetid reefs in temperate waters, their diffusion in
   the Mediterranean Sea, and the possibility of performing C-14 ages
   allowed the use of Vermetids as an indicator of sea level changes. We
   present new data on sea climate trend fluctuations that could be
   interpreted as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) variations, recorded on
   Vermetid (Dendropoma petraeum) reefs, by means of isotopic analysis. The
   isotopic records show positive values of the delta(18)O relative to
   present-day values in the period between 1600 and 1850 AD; this
   deviation occurs in association with the climatic cooling event known as
   Little Ice Age (LIA). Subsequently, we can observe the warming trend
   that characterized the last century. These preliminary results indicate
   that Vermetids could be considered a new SST proxy-data for the
   Mediterranean Sea and, more generally, for temperate areas. (C) 2003

Title = {Effective climate sensitivity distributions from a 1D model of global

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},

Abstract = {Current theoretically based Earth system models (ESMs) produce Effective
   Climate Sensitivities (EffCS) that range over a factor of three, with
   80\% of those models producing stronger global warming trends for
   1970-2021 than do observations. To make a more observationally based
   estimate of EffCS, a 1D time-dependent forcing-feedback model of
   temperature departures from energy equilibrium is used to match measured
   ranges of global-average surface and sub-surface land and ocean
   temperature trends during 1970-2021. In response to two different
   radiative forcing scenarios, a full range of three model free parameters
   are evaluated to produce fits to a range of observed surface temperature
   trends (\& PLUSMN; 2 \& sigma;) from four different land datasets and
   three ocean datasets, as well as deep-ocean temperature trends and
   borehole-based trend retrievals over land. Land-derived EffCS are larger
   than over the ocean, and EffCS is lower using the newer Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP245, 1.86 \& DEG;C global EffCS, \& PLUSMN;
   34\% range 1.48-2.15 \& DEG;C) than the older Representative
   Concentration Pathway forcing (RCP6, 2.49 \& DEG;C global average EffCS,
   \& PLUSMN; 34\% range 2.04-2.87 \& DEG;C). The strongest dependence of
   the EffCS results is on the assumed radiative forcing dataset,
   underscoring the role of radiative forcing uncertainty in determining
   the sensitivity of the climate system to increasing greenhouse gas
   concentrations from observations alone. The results are consistent with
   previous observation-based studies that concluded EffCS during the
   observational period is on the low end of the range produced by current
   ESMs.},

Title = {Trend of annual and semiannual harmonics of sea surface temperature in
   the tropical Indian Ocean, 1979-2018},
Journal = {DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the Indian Ocean (IO), the annual and semiannual oscillations of the
   sea surface temperature (SST) contribute more than 80\% of the total
   variance. It is known that the SST in the tropical IO has warmed at a
   rate of 0.15 degrees C/ decade since 1979. However, such an estimate of
   the decadal trend of the annual and semiannual harmonics of SST remains
   unknown, despite being a strong component of the SST signal. Here we use
   a widely accepted data product (TropFlux) to quantify the annual and
   semiannual harmonics in the tropical IO for the first time. The northern
   IO has a distinctly strong semiannual cycle (1-1.8 degrees C), which is
   showing an amplifying trend (0.04 degrees C/decade) since 1979.
   Furthermore, a damping trend in annual amplitude exists over much of the
   IO, except along the northwestern Bay of Bengal, the Seychelles-Chagos
   thermocline ridge, the Persian Gulf, and the Indonesian throughflow
   region. The estimated damping of the annual amplitude is highest over
   the Arabian Sea. In contrast, the southern tropical IO has a predominant
   annual cycle, the amplitude of which has weakened during 1979-2018. In
   the north IO, net air-sea heat flux and vertical processes show a
   dominant semiannual harmonic oscillation similar to SST. Additionally,
   the annual amplitude is influential over southern IO. Horizontal
   advection contributes significantly along the boundary-current regions
   and the western equatorial IO. Our analysis of combined annual and
   semiannual cycles shows significant warming in the tropical IO during
   October-November and cooling during July-August owing to the
   amplification of semiannual oscillation. These changes in the SST can
   influence air-sea interaction processes such as cyclogenesis and
   monsoon.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of autocorrelation on temporal trends
   and step change on a monthly, seasonal and annual temperatures of six
   meteorological stations over the North of Algeria. Afterwards, links
   between the general atmospheric circulation, via six climate indices,
   and temperature data are examined. The trends in temperatures are
   analysed using six different versions of the Mann-Kendall approach
   while, the step changes of the time series are defined using the
   original Pettitt test and the modified-Pettitt. The Statistical tests
   have shown an increase in annual temperatures from 0.8 to 0.9 degrees C
   since the 1980s in the coastal regions and the 1990s on the highlands.
   This warming most often exceeds 1 degrees C on a seasonal scale,
   particularly in summer; however, no significant trend is observed in the
   winter. On a monthly scale, the increase in temperatures is marked
   between April and October. The analysis of the relationships between six
   climate indices and average temperatures has shown that the inter-annual
   temperature variability is most often associated with the East Atlantic
   oscillation for the entire study area. The winter temperatures are
   influenced by the Mediterranean oscillation as well as the North
   Atlantic oscillation. The East Atlantic oscillation is the dominant mode
   of circulation in spring and summer, whereas in autumn, the temperatures
   are strongly linked to the West Mediterranean oscillation. However, no
   significant correlations have been observed between temperatures and the
   Arctic oscillation and El Nino southern oscillation.},

Abstract = {The weather of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, the largest ice-free
   region of the Antarctica, has been continuously monitored since 1985
   with currently 14 operational meteorological stations distributed
   throughout the valleys. Because climate is based on a 30-year record of
   weather, this is the first study to truly define the contemporary
   climate of the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Mean air temperature and solar
   radiation based on all stations were -20 degrees C and 102 W m(-2),
   respectively. Depending on the site location, the mean annual air
   temperatures on the valleys floors ranged between -15 degrees C and -30
   degrees C, and mean annual solar radiation varied between 72 and 122 W
   m(-2). Surface air temperature decreased by 0.7 degrees C per decade
   from 1986 to 2006 at Lake Hoare station (longest continuous record),
   after which the record is highly variable with no trend. All stations
   with sufficiently long records showed similar trend shifts in 2005 +/- 1
   year. Summer is defined as November through February, using a physically
   based process: up-valley warming from the coast associated with a change
   in atmospheric stability.},

Abstract = {The variability of zonal trends of surface air temperature for the

   atmospheric circulation model (AGCM) with identical prescribed

   conditions. It is shown that the dependence of the variability of
   intra-ensemble zonal temperature trends on the variability of zonal
   fluctuations of temperature anomalies (associated with the internal
   variability of atmospheric circulation in the AGCM) is described quite
   well in terms of the stationary stochastic process model. In such a
   model, the dependence of the standard deviation of intra-ensemble trends
   can be approximated by a linear function of the standard deviation of
   temperature fluctuations, which agrees well with the AGCM results.},

Abstract = {The IPCC Third Assessment Report noted that three major temperature
   analyses exhibited different warming rates over global land areas since
   1976. This paper attempts to explain these trend discrepancies by
   quantifying the sensitivity of global, hemispheric, and grid-box trends
   to both the spatial averaging technique and the underlying station
   network. The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) analysis and
   the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) analysis have comparable trends when
   the same approach is used to compute the global time series, and since
   the mid-1970s the rate of warming in both is as much as a third greater
   than in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) analysis. On the
   hemispheric scale, GHCN and CRU have similar trends regardless of the
   gridding approach, whereas GISS again has less warming in recent decades
   ( particularly in the Southern Hemisphere). GHCN and CRU also exhibit
   reasonable agreement at the grid-box level during the period 1976-2003.},

Title = {The vertical profile of recent tropical temperature trends: Persistent
   model biases in the context of internal variability},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Tropospheric and stratospheric tropical temperature trends in recent
   decades have been notoriously hard to simulate using climate models,
   particularly in the upper troposphere. Aside from the warming trend
   itself, this has broader implications, e.g. atmospheric circulation
   trends depend on latitudinal temperature gradients. In this study,
   tropical temperature trends in the CMIP6 models are examined, from 1979
   to 2014, and contrasted with trends from the RICH/RAOBCORE radiosondes,
   and the ERA5/5.1 reanalysis. As in earlier studies, we find considerable
   warming biases in the CMIP6 modeled trends, and we show that these
   biases are linked to biases in surface temperature. We also uncover
   previously undocumented biases in the lower-middle stratosphere: the
   CMIP6 models appear unable to capture the time evolution of
   stratospheric cooling, which is non-monotonic owing to the Montreal
   Protocol. Finally, using models with large ensembles, we show that their
   standard deviation in tropospheric temperature trends, which is due to
   internal variability alone, explains similar to 50\% (+/- 20\%) of that
   from the CMIP6 models.},

Title = {Linear trends in temperature extremes in China, with an emphasis on

Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Record-breaking hot and cold extremes have occurred in China in recent
   years and, therefore, it is compelling to investigate the long-term
   trend in temperature extremes at individual stations to see whether they
   have become more frequent. Many previous studies on the linear trend
   analysis of temperaure extremes in China have used oridinary least
   squares (OLS) regression, without consideration of non-Gaussian and/or
   serially dependent characteristics, or nonparametric methods, again not
   considering the latter, thus leaving some uncertainty in the
   significance testing. The present study examines in detail these
   characteristics in eight commonly used extreme temperature indices, on
   the basis of both station data and gridded data across China. The
   results show that 71-100\% of the stations or grids cannot directly use
   standard OLS regression to analyze the statistical significance of the
   linear trend, because of either non-Gaussian or Gaussian but serially
   dependent characteristics in the regression residuals. Also, more than
   43\% of the stations and more than 54\% of the grid boxes for annual
   indies cannot directly use the original Sen's slope estimator and
   Mann-Kendall test because of serial dependence. Based on a nonparamtric
   method that takes into account serial dependence, the spatial patterns
   of the linear trend on an annual basis, as well as in hot and cold
   extremes, are examined for the period 1960-2017. The results show that
   hot extremes at most stations have increased, more than 57\% of which
   are statistically significant; whereas, cold extremes at almost all
   stations have decreased, more than 32\% (85\%) of which are
   statistically significant during daytime (at night).},

Abstract = {The seasonal distribution of linear trends in air temperature on the
   coast of the Black and Azov seas in 1936-2010 is analyzed using the
   quantile regression method. Monthly mean and median values of
   temperature as well as 10\% and 90\% quantiles of average daily values
   of temperature are considered to describe changes in extreme positive
   and negative temperature anomalies. It is demonstrated that besides
   tendencies that are common for all meteorological stations, local
   features and physiographic location of the stations are of great
   importance for the distribution of temperature trends.},

Abstract = {Mechanical properties and glass transition temperatures (T-g) of
   Fe-Cr-Mo-P-C-B bulk metallic glasses containing up to 27 at. \%
   metalloids have been studied. The shear modulus (G) is found to decrease

   similar to 3\% is obtained, despite the increase in the number of strong
   metal-metalloid bonds. Also, T-g increases with the decrease in G, in
   contrast to usual behavior. By employing first-principles calculations,
   the results are discussed in light of atomic bonding and connectivity in
   the amorphous network. The findings are relevant to understanding
   ductility and glass transition of metallic glasses. (c) 2008 American

Abstract = {The Baltic Sea is one of the fastest-warming marginal seas globally, and
   its temperature rise has adversely affected its physical and biochemical
   characteristics. In this study, forty years (1982-2021) of sea surface
   temperature (SST) data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer
   (AVHRR) were used to investigate spatial and temporal SST variability of
   the Baltic Sea. To this end, annual maximum and minimum SST stacked
   series, i.e., time series of stacked layers of satellite data, were
   generated using high-quality observations acquired at night and were fed
   to an automatic algorithm to detect linear and non-linear trend
   patterns. The linear trend pattern was the dominant trend type in both
   stacked series, while more pixels with non-linear trend patterns were
   detected when using the annual minimum SST. However, both stacked series
   showed increases in SST across the Baltic Sea. Annual maximum SST
   increased by an average of 0.062 +/- 0.041 degrees C per year between
   1982 and 2021, while annual minimum SST increased by an average of 0.035
   +/- 0.017 degrees C per year over the same period. Averaging annual
   maximum and minimum trends produces a spatial average of 0.048 +/- 0.022
   degrees C rise in SST per year over the last four decades.},

Abstract = {The global mean surface air temperature (GMST) shows multidecadal
   variability over the period of 1910-2013, with an increasing trend. This
   study quantifies the contribution of hemispheric surface air temperature
   (SAT) variations and individual ocean sea surface temperature (SST)
   changes to the GMST multidecadal variability for 1910-2013. At the
   hemispheric scale, both the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS)
   observations and the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Community
   Atmosphere Model 5.3 (CAM5.3) simulation indicate that the Northern
   Hemisphere (NH) favors the GMST multidecadal trend during periods of
   accelerated warming (1910-1945, 1975-1998) and cooling (1940-1975,
   2001-2013), whereas the Southern Hemisphere (SH) slows the intensity of
   both warming and cooling processes. The contribution of the NH SAT
   variation to the GMST multidecadal trend is higher than that of the SH.
   We conduct six experiments with different ocean SST forcing, and find
   that all the oceans make positive contributions to the GMST multidecadal
   trend during rapid warming periods. However, only the Indian, North
   Atlantic, and western Pacific oceans make positive contributions to the
   GMST multidecadal trend between 1940 and 1975, whereas only the tropical
   Pacific and the North Pacific SSTs contribute to the GMST multidecadal
   trend between 2001 and 2013. The North Atlantic and western Pacific
   oceans have important impacts on modulating the GMST multidecadal trend
   across the entire 20th century. Each ocean makes different contributions
   to the SAT multidecadal trend of different continents during different
   periods.},

Abstract = {This study seeks a further understanding on climate trends in a
   subtropical mountain forest, SW China. Air (Ta) and soil temperature
   (Ts), both in open land (19832010) and under a forest canopy (19862010),
   were investigated. Short-term radiation components were also measured
   simultaneously both in open land and understory to explore the
   relationships of microclimatic variables. Correlations of Ta and Ts with
   sunshine hours (St) and wind speed (Ws) were also analysed as driving
   factors of the temperature trends. The results showed that (1)
   Understory radiation components were greatly reduced by the forest
   canopy, showing a strong effect of forest canopy on microclimatic
   variables. Ts\_0 in open land was significantly correlated with solar
   radiation. Wind speed had significant influences on differences between
   Ta and Ts\_0, between open land Ts\_0 and understory Ts\_0. The
   long-term data showed that Ts\_0 under forest canopy were closely
   coupled with Ta in open land. (2) Ta had a larger increase than Ts\_0 in
   open land, and temperature increases in winter were greater than in
   other seasons. Soil temperature at depths under forest canopy had nearly
   twice the increases of those on open land; we attributed this to the
   higher relative increase of Ws over St. (3) A slope change in 1998 was
   detected in the Ts\_0 and Ta difference (Ts\_0 Ta) series, suggesting
   different response of Ts\_0 and Ta since that year. Deceleration of St
   and stability of Ws may have been factors. This study improves our
   understanding of warming in a nature reserve where anthropogenic
   influences are absent. Further studies are needed for the biological and
   biochemical implications on subtropical mountain forest. Copyright (c)

Title = {Factors governing the interannual variation and the long-term trend of

Abstract = {This study examines the ability of the interannual variability in the
   occurrence of synoptic types, intensity of large-scale circulations and
   global temperature to explain that of the 850 hPa temperature in Israel
   for the summer and the winter. The synoptic factor was represented by 19
   types defined by Alpert etal. (2004b). For the summer, the deep and the
   weak Persian Trough explained 35\% of the interannual temperature
   variance. For the winter, the lows to the east and to the north
   explained 44\% of the interannual temperature variance. Two additional
   factors were incorporated: large-scale circulations, the North Atlantic
   Oscillation for the summer and the Arctic Oscillation for the winter;
   and global radiative forcing, represented by the global temperature.
   Both of them were found to be significant, and the variance explained by
   all of them is 56\% for the summer and 64\% for the winter. In the
   summer the variation is dominated by warm and cool types whereas in the
   winter the cold systems dominate.
   The individual contribution of each factor to the long-term temperature
   trend was estimated. While the global radiative forcing contribution was
   positive and large in both seasons, the synoptic contribution was
   positive, four times larger in the summer. The large-scale contribution
   was negative, three times larger in the winter. The considerable warming
   in the summer results from a rapid increase in the occurrence of the
   weak Persian Trough, which is a warm type. The study approach may be
   useful for predicting future temperature regimes, based on predicted
   synoptic features in climatic models. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal

Abstract = {A study of glacial-interglacial periods shows that, once ice sheets
   reach a critical maximal mass, the glaciation period changes to an
   interglacial one; the latter gives way to the following glaciation
   period, during which the ice sheet mass becomes minimal. The last
   interglacial period, the Holocene, has been going on for more than 10
   ka; this raises the question of the timing of the end of the Holocene
   and the beginning of the upcoming glaciation. The retrieval of detailed
   information on the mechanisms of climate change is connected with the
   study of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, oceanic sediments, and
   continuous terrestrial proxy data. Long-term continuous data on the
   variability of land ice in Greenland and Antarctica provide valuable
   information on the climate variability pattern in the time intervals of
   the transition from glacial conditions to interglacial ones and vice
   versa. The data on temperature anomalies in Greenland and Antarctica are
   compared and analyzed here. The paper mainly focuses on the temperature
   variability pattern for the time interval of the transition from the
   last glacial maximum to the present moment (i.e., the temperature and
   trends in its changes are reconstructed).},

Title = {Climate change simulation and trend analysis of extreme precipitation

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Due to climate change and global warming, speed and intensity of the
   hydrological cycle will accelerate. In order to carry out regional risk
   assessment, integrated water resources management and flood protection,
   far reaching predictions and future scenarios of climate change effects
   on extreme precipitation and flooding are of particular relevance. In
   this study, trends in frequencies of extreme precipitation and floods
   until 2099 are analysed for the German Rur catchment, which is half
   located in highlands and half in lowlands and therefore has a high
   topographical and climatological contrast. To predict future trends,
   coupled modeling is performed based on NCEP reanalysis data and a
   General Circulation Model (GCM). Assuming HadCM3 future emission
   scenarios A2a and B2a, an empirical Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM)
   is developed and daily precipitation amounts are projected until 2099 by
   a stochastic weather generator. The generated precipitation data are
   used as an input for the ecohydrological Soil \& Water Assessment Tool
   (SWAT model) to simulate daily water discharge until 2099. Statistical
   trend analyses are implemented based on three annual extreme
   precipitation indices (EPIs) and the magnitudes of ten flood return
   periods derived with GEV and Gumbel extreme value distributions for 109
   30-year moving periods using regression analyses and Mann-Kendall
   tendency tests to check for significant trends in the frequencies until
   2099. As a result, it could be demonstrated for all EPIs that the
   frequency of extreme precipitation in the upper Rur catchment will
   significantly increase by +33\% to +51\% until 2099 compared to the base
   period 1961-1990, whereas mostly non-significant negative trends of
   extreme precipitation can be projected in the lowlands. For runoff, it
   was found that the magnitudes of the ten flood return periods will
   significantly increase by +31\% for B2a to +36\% for A2a until 2099
   compared to the base period.},

Abstract = {The Earth's surface temperatures have increased significantly since the
   beginning of industrialisation. The high emissions of greenhouse gases
   have contributed to global warming and climate change, which is expected
   to continue. Here, we investigate the long-term trends of surface
   temperature in India using surface, satellite and reanalysis data for
   the period of 1980-2020, and assess the influence of geophysical drivers
   on temperature change using the causal discovery. The highest mean
   surface temperatures are observed in the southern India and the lowest
   in Himalaya in accordance with the incidence of solar radiation. Causal
   discovery reveals the relative influence of atmospheric processes,
   aerosols and specific humidity on surface temperature. We observe a
   positive trend in temperature during pre-monsoon (0.1-0.3 degrees C
   dec-1) and post-monsoon (0.2-0.4 degrees C dec(-1)) seasons in the
   northwest, northeast and north-central India. The analysis exposes high
   annual (0.22 +/- 0.14 degrees C dec(-1)) and monsoon (0.24 +/- 0.08
   degrees C dec(-1)) warming in the northeast India. Post-monsoon season
   shows a positive trend in the entire India, where the highest value is
   estimated for the western Himalaya (0.2-0.5 degrees C dec(-1)) and
   northeast India (0.1-0.4 degrees C dec(-1)). Analyses with the Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) results show that temperature
   can increase up to 1.1-5.1 degrees C by year 2100 under the Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP5)-8.5 scenario. The increasing trend of
   temperature in India is a big concern, which calls for adaption and
   mitigation measures to alleviate adverse effects of accelerated warming
   and regional climate change.},

Title = {On the Observed Trends and Changes in Global Sea Surface Temperature and
   Air-Sea Heat Fluxes (1984-2006)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {18},
Pages = {6123-6135},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Global satellite observations show the sea surface temperature (SST)
   increasing since the 1970s in all ocean basins, while the net air-sea
   heat flux Q decreases. Over the period 1984-2006 the global changes are
   0.28 C in SST and -9.1 W m(-2) in Q, giving an effective air-sea
   coupling coefficient of -32 W m(-2) degrees C-1. The global response in
   Q expected from SST alone is determined to be -12.9 W m(-2), and the
   global distribution of the associated coupling coefficient is shown.
   Typically, about one-half (6.8 W m(-2)) of this SST effect on heat flux
   is compensated by changes in the overlying near-surface atmosphere. Slab
   Ocean Models (SOMs) assume that ocean heating processes do not change
   from year to year so that a constant annual heat flux would maintain a
   linear trend in annual SST. However, the necessary 6.1 W m(-2) increase
   is not found in the downwelling longwave and shortwave fluxes, which
   combined show a -3 W m(-2) decrease. The SOM assumptions are revisited
   to determine the most likely source of the inconsistency with
   observations of (-12.9 + 6.8 - 3) = -9.1 W m(-2). The indirect inference
   is that diminished ocean cooling due to vertical ocean processes played
   an important role in sustaining the observed positive trend in global
   SST from 1984 through 2006, despite the decrease in global surface heat
   flux. A similar situation is found in the individual basins, though
   magnitudes differ. A conclusion is that natural variability, rather than
   long-term climate change, dominates the SST and heat flux changes over
   this 23-yr period. On shorter time scales the relationship between SST
   and heat flux exhibits a variety of behaviors.},

Abstract = {A medium-length ice core was drilled at the ice divide oil the
   Lomorlosov-fonna plateau (1230 in a.s.l.), Svalbard, in May 1997. As
   part of this project, temperature measurements were performed in the 120
   in deep borehole. At this site the ice thickness based oil radar
   measurements is 126.5 m and the mean annual accumulation rate is 380 kg
   m(-3). The measurements over the 15-120 in depth interval show a nearly
   isothermal profile with a mean value of -2.8degreesC and a standard
   deviation of 0.2degreesC. The measurements reveal a temperature minimum
   at approximately 70 in depth and a temperature gradient of 0.011 +/-
   0.004degreesC m(-1) near the bottom. The temperature minimum and
   relatively low temperature gradient cannot be explained in terms of a
   steady-state climate. Numerical calculations with a simple
   one-dimensional diffusion-advection model show that the temperature
   increased at a maximum rate of 0.02-0.025 Ka(-1) over the last 100
   years, the total temperature increase amounting to 2.0-3.0 K. Forcing
   the model with the observed record at Svalbard airport revealed that In
   the 19th century the surface temperature was at most 2.5 K lower, and
   that the instrumental observations started during a period with
   temperatures comparable to the end of the 19th century. The data are of
   particular interest for historical simulations since often no other
   temperature data are available in polar areas.},

   report that CeO2 co-doped with Gd + Sb, Pr + Sb, and Bi + Sb trivalent
   cations have superior performance for WSR with the reaction rate 2-5
   orders of magnitude larger than that of individual trivalent dopants
   including Ga, Sb, Lu, Gd, Sm, Pr, Bi, and La, owing to improved
   stability of hydridic H-species and accordingly decreased barrier for
   their decompositions into H2 by co-doping. The energy of hydridic
   H-species and the turn-over frequency (TOF) toward H2 production is
   shown to correlate well with the average ionic radius of trivalent
   cations, where the TOF increases with decreasing ionic radius and Gd +
   Sb, Pr + Sb, and Bi + Sb with smaller ionic radius show better WSR
   activity than other dopants. Our studies suggest incorporating ceria
   with proper co-dopants with an average radius close to Gd + Sb, Pr + Sb,
   or Bi + Sb pairs as an effective strategy for enhancing WSR performance
   on CeO2 in SOECs.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This

Abstract = {In recent years, the middle atmosphere has evoked great scientific
   interest as long-term changes can be clearly captured owing to the large
   perturbation amplitudes at these altitudes. In the present study, more
   than 25 years of the data are used to investigate the long-term trends
   in the middle atmosphere by suitably combining the observations from
   different techniques (Rocketsonde, High-Resolution Doppler Imager
   (HRDI)/Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), Halogen Occultation
   Experiment (HALOE)/UARS, Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband
   Emission Radiometry (SABER)/Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetic
   Dynamics (TIMED), and Mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) radar)
   from Indian region. As different instruments/techniques are used and the
   time periods are not the same, extreme care has been taken while merging
   various data sets to obtain meaningful long-term trends. To understand
   the observed long-term trends, Whole Atmosphere Community Climate
   Model-eXtended model simulations for the Indian low-latitude regions are
   also used. A significant cooling trend of similar to-1.7 +/- 0.5
   K/decade between 30 and 80 km is noticed. Large decreasing trend
   (similar to 5 m/s/decade) in the eastward winds is noticed which is
   significant between 70 and 80 km only changing from strong eastward wind
   in 1970s to weak westward wind in recent decade. No significant trends
   are observed in the meridional wind. These observations are well
   captured by the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model-eXtended model
   simulations while considering changes in concentrations of greenhouse
   gases including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), water vapor (H2O),
   and chlorofluorocarbon species that cause depletion of stratospheric
   ozone (O-3). Thus, it is prudent to conclude that long-term decreasing
   trends in the zonal winds and cooling trends in the temperature in the
   middle atmosphere are caused to a large extent by greenhouse gases
   suggesting the role of anthropogenic changes in the dynamics of the
   middle atmosphere.},

Title = {Trends in sea surface temperature off the coast of Ecuador and the major
   processes that contribute to them},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {164},
Pages = {151-164},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Monthly-averaged sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from seven adjoining
   sub-regions spanning the coast of Ecuador have been examined for
   long-term trends and the major processes that contribute to them. The
   study area extends from the coast out to 84 degrees W longitude, and
   from 4 degrees S to 2 degrees N latitude. The period of observation
   extends from 1900 through 2014, a period of 115 years. Linear trend
   analysis shows that the slopes are positive in all sub-regions and
   statistically significant in 5 out of 7 of them. Based on the trends
   SSTs increased from + 0.10 degrees C to + 1.42 degrees C over the entire
   period with the greatest increases occurring in the sub-regions next to
   the coast and to a lesser extent in the northern and southern
   sub-regions.
   A second non-linear trend analysis was conducted using Ensemble
   Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). The results from EEMD for the
   various sub-regions indicate that SSTs increased significantly from 1900
   to at least 1940 in the majority of cases. After 1950, SSTs tended to
   fluctuate with a minimum that often occurred during the 1960s or 1970s.
   Since circa 1990, SSTs have experienced little change. Because the data
   tended to be spatially homogeneous, with two sub-regions being possible
   exceptions, a mean data set was calculated and likewise subjected to
   EEMD. The results show that SSTs have increased by approximately 1
   degrees C since 1900 but the process has not been uniform. The increase
   in temperature between 1900 and at least 1940 approaches 1 degrees C,
   similar to the trends found in the majority of sub-regions. Between-1950
   and 1990, temperatures decreased slightly until the mid-1960s and then
   gradually increased until about 1990. Since-1990 there has been no
   significant change in SST. Overall, the results of the global mean
   analysis are generally consistent with the sub-regional results. Several
   sources of variability have been tentatively identified that may
   contribute to the long-term changes in temperature that we have
   observed. Both spectral analysis and EEMD suggest the importance of the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation as possibly the greatest contributor. The
   two major maxima in the PDO index that occurred during the past century
   (-1940 and-1990) are generally consistent with maxima and/or inflection
   points that occur both in the sub-regional and regional long-term
   trends. It has been difficult to associate specific ENSO episodes with
   the long-term trends. However, ENSO and the PDO are closely related.
   Recent modeling studies have shown that the PDO essentially owes its
   existence to ENSO. Thus, ENSO appears to be a major contributor to the
   long-term trends through its primary contribution to the PDO. Finally,
   spectral analysis also revealed the existence of an oscillation whose
   period is-73 years, easily of sufficient length to influence the
   long-term trends. Climate-related oscillations in the range of 70-100
   years are often associated with the Gleissberg sunspot cycle and this
   could be a contributing factor.
   The long-term trends are not necessarily a dominant feature in our data.
   However, had the observations been limited to the period from 1900 to
   -1940, the trends would have been, without a doubt, dominant. Overall,
   the likely influence of the PDO on the observed long-term trends in SST
   must be emphasized. Finally, over the past 25 years there has been no
   significant change in surface temperature over the study area and this
   may be due in part to the cooling influence of the PDO since -1990. (C)

Abstract = {Times series of Egypt for 24 stations were investigated for
   multi-decadal variability for temperature trends over the period
   1960-2000. One-Way ANOVA analysis was applied to assess whether there is
   any statistically significant differences between the means of
   temperature at the decadal scales. Annual trends are assessed by means
   of the linear trend analysis by calculating the least squares fit for a
   line multiplied by 10 gives the change per decade and the non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test for trend was applied to detect the trends. The
   spatial interpolation by universal kriging method was applied by ArcGIS
   software to generate the temperature surface for each decade to show the
   spatial variability between the decades and the spatial variability to
   temperature trends were detected by symbology process in ArcGIS
   software. For the observation period (1960-2000) upward trends were
   shown for mean and minimum temperature and downward trends for maximum
   temperature, and Egypt showed relatively disparate between the means of
   decades, and the first decade was the coolest and the fourth decade was
   the warmest for all temperature variables. The southern part has clear
   upward trend than the other parts of Egypt in all variables of

Abstract = {The present study reports long-term variabilities and trends in the
   middle atmospheric temperature (March 1998-2008) derived from Rayleigh
   backscattered signals received by the Nd:YAG lidar system at Gadanki
   (13.5 degrees N. 79.2 degrees E). The monthly mean temperature
   compositely averaged for the years 1998-2008 shows maximum temperature
   of 270 K in the months of March-April and September at altitudes between
   similar to 45 and 55 km. The altitude profile of trend coefficients
   estimated from the 10 years of temperature observations using regression
   analysis shows that there exists cooling at the rate with 1 sigma
   uncertainty of 0.12 +/- 0.1 K/year in the lower stratospheric altitudes
   (35-42 km) and 0.2 +/- 0.08 K/year at altitudes near 55-60 km. The trend
   is nearly zero (no significant cooling or warming) at altitudes 40-55
   km. The regression analysis reveals the significant ENSO response in the
   lower stratosphere (1 K/SOI) and also in mesosphere (0.6 K/SOI). The
   solar cycle response shows negative maxima of similar to 1.5 K/100F10.7
   units at altitudes 36 km, 41 km and 1K/100F10.7 units at 57 km. The
   response is positive at mesospheric altitude near 67 km (1.3 K/100F10.7
   units). The amplitudes and phases of semiannual, annual and
   quasi-biennial oscillations are estimated using least squares method.
   The semiannual oscillation shows larger amplitudes at altitudes near
   35,45, 62 and 74 km whereas the annual oscillation peaks at 70 km. The
   quasi-biennial oscillations show larger amplitudes below 35 km and above
   70 km. The phase profiles of semiannual and annual oscillations show
   downward propagation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd, All rights reserved.},

Title = {The trend of lessepsian fish populations with an emphasis on temperature

Abstract = {The fish assemblages of the Eastern Mediterranean are highly variable
   owing to the Lessepsian migration. So far, there has been limited
   discussion about the temporal variation of Lessepsian populations, which
   may be a key to better understanding the establishment, persistence and
   spreading dynamics of these species. The objective of this study was,
   therefore, to develop an understanding of inter-annual variations of
   Lessepsian fish populations through investigating the effects of climate
   conditions. For this purpose, we evaluated the data obtained from the
   seasonal bottom trawl surveys conducted over the course of 12years, from
   2004 to 2015, at the infra-littoral zone of Iskenderun Bay. Our results
   indicated that Lessepsians constituted 27\%, 62\% and 85\% of total
   teleost fishes in the number of species (LS-\%), biomass (LW-\%) and
   abundance (LN-\%), respectively. The linear trends showed that the
   dominance of Lessepsian fishes increased with annual rates of 1.9
   (p<.01, LS-\%), 2.77 (p<.01, LW-\%) and 1.43\% (p<.05, LN-\%) per year
   during the study period. In contrast, seasonal trend decomposition based
   on GAMMs revealed that the true shape of trends was non-linear. The
   majority of the new Lessepsians entered the study area after 2009 when
   warmer conditions prevailed. Those new invaders such as Nemipterus
   randalli, Pomadasys stridens and Apogon smithi successfully settled in a
   short time and remarkably altered the composition of fish assemblages
   after 2010. We found that variations of lessepsian fish assemblages were
   correlatedwith the increase of annual minima and average values of sea
   surface temperature.},

   High Temperature Anomalies over the Russian Far East},

Abstract = {This study investigates the mechanism behind the recent boreal summer
   circulation trend pattern and associated high surface temperature
   anomalies over the Russian Far East. This circulation pattern includes a
   prominent anticyclone over the Kamchatka Peninsula where heat extremes
   have been trending upward. Observational analysis and numerical model
   simulations indicate that latent heating anomalies centered over
   Yakutia, west of Kamchatka Peninsula, can excite this anticyclone and
   the downstream circulation trend pattern. However, this anticyclone
   alone is insufficient for generating the anomalously high temperature
   over the region. Instead, the high temperature emerges when there is an
   upstream precursor that resembles the Eurasian circulation trend
   pattern. Warm advection by this upstream circulation initiates a
   positive temperature anomaly over the Russian Far East, one week prior
   to the onset of the anticyclone in this region. As this anticyclone
   develops, the temperature anomalies further intensify by adiabatic
   warming and shortwave radiative heating. If upstream circulation
   anomalies are opposite to those of the Eurasian trend pattern, the
   initial temperature over the Russian Far East is anomalously negative.
   As a result, the adiabatic warming and shortwave radiative heating
   within this anticyclonic region are unable to bring the temperature to
   an extreme condition. These findings indicate that the temperature
   extremes over the Russian Far East are contributed by a combination of
   remote and local circulation forcings and provide insights into
   subseasonal forecasts of heat waves over this region.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the relative contribution of internal
   variability and external forcings on summer (June-August) surface air
   temperature (SAT) over the central Indian landmass. Here we use
   Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) data to assess the
   historical (1966-2005) and future (2010-2060) climate change in presence
   of internal climate variability. The summer SAT trend during the
   historical period exhibits an amplified cooling (<-3 degrees C), whereas
   a warming trend (>= 4 degrees C) is projected in all the ensemble
   members under RCP8.5 scenario. The total trend is then partitioned into
   contributions from the externally forced response and internal climatic
   variability. Over the Indian region, the external forcing displays a
   strong cooling trend during the historical period and warming trend
   under RCP8.5 scenario. On the other hand, natural variability displays
   mainly cooling trends and it introduces a wide range of uncertainty to
   the future projection in climate models. In historical period, the
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that is, ratio of external forcings and
   internal variability, is less than 1, which indicates that the internal
   climatic variability dominates over the forced response. But in future
   decades the SNR is much higher than 1, that is, external forcing
   overrides the internal variability. However, to a greater extent natural
   variability will mask the warming trend over the Indian region, even
   under RCP8.5 scenario.},

Abstract = {Maximum covariance analysis (MCA) forecasts of gridded seasonal North

   is the representation of the ongoing climate warming, implemented by
   adding the average of the most recent 15 years' predictand data to the
   climate anomalies computed by the MCA. For winter and spring forecasts
   at short (0-1 month) lead times, best forecasts were achieved using the
   snow-extent predictors together with this representation of the warming
   trend. The short available period of record for the snow data likely
   limits the skill that could be achieved using these predictors, as well

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {This study quantifies the impact of ENSO on the decadal predictability
   of tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean trends in a very large ensemble of NCAR
   CCSM3 anthropogenically-forced (A1B scenario) simulations, by
   decomposing upper ocean temperatures into ``ENSO{''} and ``non-ENSO{''}
   variability. On decadal time scales, the ENSO pattern primarily
   contributes to the ensemble spread and has a trend whose amplitude is
   not predictable. However, the non-ENSO component of the trend has much
   smaller spread and is predictable after 10 years, much sooner than the
   total trend, which is predictable after 25 years. The non-ENSO component
   of the trend explains 96\% of the total trend and has a structure that
   is distinct from ENSO, including cooling in the South Pacific due to
   increased southeast trades, warming of the warm pool, and strengthening
   of the equatorial Pacific near-surface temperature gradient superimposed
   upon a uniform warming. Citation: Solomon, A., and M. Newman (2011),

Abstract = {The current study aims to analyze the trend of monthly average
   temperature in Basrah province to understand the role of land use
   changes in this pattern. Data which was recorded at Hay Al-Hussain
   station in the city of Basrah over a span of 74 years (1948-2022) were
   utilized for this purpose. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's slope estimator were used to estimate the trend and the magnitude
   of the trend, respectively. Findings revealed that the average
   temperature trend is increasing at a rate of 0.00475 degrees C/month
   (4.218 degrees C in total). This indicates that Basrah is experiencing a
   faster temperature increase than the global average (1 degrees C) and
   the Middle East region (2 degrees C). Five main factors contributed to
   the temperature rise in the study area: increasing oil fields, reduction
   of green cover, global warming, urban expansion, and wetland shrinkage.
   Furthermore, the study revealed that the impact of changes in land use
   outweighs the effect of global warming on the temperature rise in the
   study area. This finding could facilitate the implementation of measures
   to reduce the warming rate within Basrah and other regions inside and
   outside Iraq, for the purpose of adapting to the climate change effects
   that are already occurring. This can be achieved by controlling
   unplanned changes in land use and minimizing their negative effects on
   the increase of temperature.},

Abstract = {Contributions of the insolation variations together with different
   natural and anthropogenic factors to the trends of the surface air
   temperatures at different latitudes of the Northern and Southern
   Hemispheres on various temporal horizons are estimated from climate data
   since the nineteenth century with the use of empirical autoregressive
   models. As the natural climate variability modes, we take into account
   Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, El-Nino/Southern Oscillation,
   Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and
   Antarctic Oscillation. According to the obtained results, the
   contributions of the insolation variations to the trends of the surface
   air temperature are statistically insignificant on the time intervals
   under study, i.e. from a decade and longer. Taking into account the
   insolation variations in the autoregressive models weakly alters the
   estimates of the contributions of the greenhouse gases and natural
   variability modes to the temperature trends: the changes are not more
   than several per cent. Numerically, the estimated contributions of the
   insolation variations can considerably exceed the respective
   contributions of the natural variability modes both on short (less than
   two decades) and long (longer than a century) time intervals.},

Title = {The Role of Latent Heating Anomalies in Exciting the Summertime Eurasian

Abstract = {Dynamical mechanisms for the summer Eurasian circulation trend pattern
   are investigated by analyzing reanalysis data and conducting numerical
   model simulations. The daily circulations that resemble the Eurasian
   circulation trend pattern are identified and categorized into two groups
   based on surface warming signal over central and eastern Europe. In the
   group with large warm anomaly, the upper-level circulation takes on a
   wave packet form over Eurasia, and there are enhanced latent heating
   anomalies centered over the North Sea and suppressed latent heating
   anomalies over the Caspian Sea. The numerical model calculations
   indicate that these latent heating anomalies can excite an upper-level
   circulation response that resembles the Eurasian circulation trend
   pattern. Additional analysis indicates that trends of these two latent
   heating centers contribute to the long-term circulation trend. In the
   weak warm anomaly group, the circulation pattern takes on a circumglobal
   teleconnection (CGT) pattern, and there is no heating signal that
   reinforces the circulation. These results indicate that not all CGT-like
   patterns excite temperature anomalies that are persistent and in phase
   with the trend pattern, and that quasi-stationary forcings, such as the
   latent heating anomalies, play an important role in driving the boreal
   summer circulation anomaly that accompanies the strong and persistent
   surface temperature signal.},

Title = {Global and Full-Depth Ocean Temperature Trends during the Early
   Twenty-First Century from Argo and Repeat Hydrography},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1985-1997},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The early twenty-first century's warming trend of the full-depth global
   ocean is calculated by combining the analysis of Argo (top 2000 m) and
   repeat hydrography into a blended full-depth observing system. The
   surface-to-bottom temperature change over the last decade of sustained
   observation is equivalent to a heat uptake of 0.71 +/- 0.09Wm(-2)
   applied over the surface of Earth, 90\% of it being found above 2000-m
   depth. The authors decompose the temperature trend pointwise into
   changes in isopycnal depth (heave) and temperature changes along an
   isopycnal (spiciness) to describe the mechanisms controlling the
   variability. The heave component dominates the global heat content
   increase, with the largest trends found in the Southern Hemisphere's
   extratropics (0-2000 m) highlighting a volumetric increase of
   subtropical mode waters. Significant heave-related warming is also found
   in the deep North Atlantic and Southern Oceans (2000-4000 m), reflecting
   a potential decrease in deep water mass renewal rates. The spiciness
   component shows its strongest contribution at intermediate levels
   (700-2000 m), with striking localized warming signals in regions of
   intense vertical mixing (North Atlantic and Southern Oceans). Finally,
   the agreement between the independent Argo and repeat hydrography
   temperature changes at 2000m provides an overall good confidence in the
   blended heat content evaluation on global and ocean scales but also
   highlights basin-scale discrepancies between the two independent
   estimates. Those mismatches are largest in those basins with the largest
   heave signature (Southern Ocean) and reflect both the temporal and
   spatial sparseness of the hydrography sampling.},

Title = {Long-term trend and solar cycle in the middle atmosphere temperature
   revealed from merged HALOE and SABER datasets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {212},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The middle atmosphere temperature trend and solar cycle have been
   studied with long-term ground-based and satellite datasets and/or model
   simulations. Single satellite observations for middle atmosphere
   temperature are not long enough (less than 2 solar cycles) to derive
   long-term trend and solar cycle effects with great confidence. Using a
   nearly 30-year dataset merged from the Halogen Occultation Experiment
   (HALOE) observations between 1991 and 2005 and the Sounding of the
   Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) observations
   between 2002 and 2019, we study the long-term trend and solar cycle in
   the middle atmosphere temperature between 45 degrees S and 45 degrees N.
   The cooling trend is significant below 75 km with a maximum value of
   similar to-1.2 K/decade near 60-70 km in the southern hemisphere (SH)
   tropical and subtropical region. The SH cooling trend is larger than its
   counterpart in the northern hemisphere (NH). The trend derived from the
   SABER only dataset is similar to 1.5 times smaller than that derived
   from the merged dataset, which is consistent with the upper
   stratospheric ozone recovery after 1995. The positive temperature
   response to the 11-year solar cycle is similar to 1 K/100 solar flux
   units (sfu) in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere and increase
   to more than 2 K/100 sfu in the upper mesosphere of the middle
   latitudes. The temperature responses show clear hemispheric asymmetry
   with stronger responses below 70 km but weaker above in the SH than
   those in the NH. This is likely related to hemispheric asymmetry of wave
   activities induced by indirect solar radiation.},

Title = {Interannual variations and trends in surface air temperature in Finland

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Annual and seasonal variations in surface air temperature (SAT) during
   the period 1961-2011 were analysed using daily mean temperature data
   sets from regular grid points (10x10km(2)) throughout Finland. The
   Mann-Kendall nonparametric test was used to detect significant
   historical trends in SAT and Spearman's correlation coefficient () to
   test the relationships between SAT patterns and various atmospheric
   circulation patterns over the northern hemisphere. The results showed
   that mean annual SAT in Finland increased (p<0.05) by 0.4 +/- 0.2
   degrees C per decade during the study period and that the SAT was
   significantly (=0.58, p<0.05) positively correlated with the Arctic
   Oscillation (AO) index. However, there were spatial differences within
   Finland for both the trends and relationships with the atmospheric
   circulation. Analysis of seasonal mean SAT identified significant
   (p<0.05) warming trends for both spring (by 0.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C per
   decade) and summer (by 0.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C per decade). Winter and
   spring mean SATs were most strongly (p<0.05) correlated with the AO
   index (=0.72 and 0.42, respectively), while the most significant
   teleconnection pattern for mean SAT in summer was the East Atlantic (EA)
   pattern (=0.43, p<0.05); and in autumn the EA/West Russia (WR) pattern
   (=-0.59, p<0.05). These results provide a detailed spatial picture of
   climate warming in Finland in recent decades and reveal that interannual
   variation of the SAT in Finland is closely linked with a number of
   atmospheric circulation patterns, not just the AO and North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO). Annual and cold-season SAT are mainly influenced by
   the AO and NAO, whereas the EA, EA/WR, Scandinavia (SCA) and West
   Pacific (WP) patterns play an important role for warm-season SAT.},

Volume = {107},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {10-19},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Based on the results of X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and analytical
   scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), the crystallization
   trend and local chemistry of sputtered PZT films on SrTiO3 (STO) coated
   corning glass substrates have been scrutinized as functions of STO layer
   thickness (similar to 20-150 nm) and post-annealing temperature (450
   C-650 degrees C). It is shown that as a seed layer, STO thin films
   promote perovskite PZT nucleation at the PZT/STO interface at a
   temperature of similar to 450 degrees C. Irrespective of STO seed layer
   thickness, PZT films evolve as a bi-layered structure comprising of
   tetragonal perovskite and disordered fcc fluorite upon post-annealing.
   The perovskite crystals are found to be enriched with Pb and lean in Zr
   and oxygen than fluorite structures. During the post-crystallization
   growth, Zr atoms get preferentially segregated from perovskite
   structures and accumulate in top fluorite zone resulting in
   Zr-enrichment in the latter. Thinner STO seed layers are observed to be
   more effective in realizing better perovskite growth while
   crystallographic orientation selection of perovskite is dependent on
   both seed layer thickness and post-annealing temperature. Transverse
   compositional homogeneity of the grown perovskite PZT and the level of
   Pb-diffusion from film to the seed layer and glass substrate are also
   observed to be seed layer thickness dependent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Long-term population trends in American lobster (<i>Homarus

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {849-857},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Existing long-term monitoring data and studies initiated in response to
   the 1999 lobster die-off in Long Island Sound were examined to determine
   long-term trends that might clarify causes of the die-off. Data examined
   included a 28-y time series of commercial lobster-trap catch (harvest
   and discard) sea-sampling, a 20-y time series of research trawl survey
   indices, a 13-y time series of bottom water temperature, 3 y of
   mark-recapture data and I y of a research trap survey. Movement
   information was gathered from the recapture of 2.309 lobsters at large
   within the Sound for more than 30 days (average days at large = 177).
   Only 9\% of the recaptured lobsters traveled more than 10 km from their
   release point and 1.3\% traveled more than 20 km. Based on the
   recaptures reported over 3 y. it appears that most lobsters remain
   resident in the Sound and do not travel extensive distances. The eastern
   portion of Long Island Sound contained the majority of lobsters that
   moved greater distances. Abundance of lobsters by size class taken in
   the trawl survey showed a rise in overall abundance during the 1990s due
   to a substantial increase in the abundance of pre-recruit and recruit
   size lobsters (< 82 mm CL). Following the die-off, abundance of all size
   classes declined sharply. The increase and decrease in abundance of the
   sublegal size classes were negatively correlated with mean summer bottom
   water temperature. Following the die-off, the percentage of females that
   were egg-bearing in catches from the western Narrows, the area hardest
   hit by the die-off, was significantly lower compared with the rest of
   the Sound. It appears that egg-bearing females were most vulnerable to
   mortality factors causing the die-off, and/or these factors may have
   limited their ability to carry eggs. Observed mortality in the
   commercial catch in the western Sound also correlated with mean summer
   bottom water temperature over 8 y bridging the die-off (1996-2003).
   Multiple factors probably played a role in the higher-than-normal
   mortality recorded in 1999, however, the long-term monitoring data
   examined here implicate increased bottom water temperatures as a
   significant contributing factor.},

Abstract = {The 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle arises from variations in the angle of
   the Moon's orbital plane. Previous work has linked the nodal cycle to
   climate but has been limited by either the length of observations
   analysed or geographical regions considered in model simulations of the
   pre-industrial period. Here we examine the global effect of the lunar
   nodal cycle in multi-centennial climate model simulations of the
   pre-industrial period. We find cyclic signals in global and regional
   surface air temperature (with amplitudes of around 0.1 K) and in ocean
   heat uptake and ocean heat content. The timing of anomalies of global
   surface air temperature and heat uptake is consistent with the so-called
   slowdown in global warming in the first decade of the 21st century. The
   lunar nodal cycle causes variations in mean sea level pressure exceeding
   0.5 hPa in the Nordic Seas region, thus affecting the North Atlantic
   Oscillation during boreal winter. Our results suggest that the
   contribution of the lunar nodal cycle to global temperature should be
   negative in the mid-2020s before becoming positive again in the early
   2030s, reducing the uncertainty in time at which projected global
   temperature reaches 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.},

Abstract = {Regional changes in surface meteorological variables are one of the key
   issues affecting the Indian subcontinent especially in recent decades.
   These changes impact agriculture, health, water, etc., hence important
   to assess and investigate these changes. The Indian subcontinent is
   characterized by heterogeneous temperature regimes at regional and
   seasonal scales. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) observations
   are limited to recent decades as far as its spatial distribution is
   concerned. In particular, over Hilly region, these observations are
   sporadic. Due to variable topography and heterogeneous land use/land
   cover, it is complex to substantiate impacts. The European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim (ERA-I) reanalysis
   not only covers a larger spatial domain but also provides a greater
   number of inputs than IMD. This study used ERA-I in conjunction with IMD
   gridded data to provide a comparative assessment of changing temperature
   patterns over India and its subregions at both regional and seasonal
   scales. Warming patterns are observed in both ERA-I and IMD data sets.
   Cold nights decrease during winter; warm days increase and warm spell
   duration increased during winter could become a cause of concern for
   society, agriculture, socio-economic reasons, and health. Increasing
   warm days over the hilly regions may affect the corresponding snow cover
   and thus river hydrology and glaciological dynamics. Such changes during
   monsoon are slower, which could be attributed to moisture availability
   to dampen the temperature changes. On investigation and comparison
   thereon, the present study provisions usages of ERA-I-based indices for
   various impact and adaptation studies.},

Title = {A moving windows visual approach to analysing spatial variation in

Abstract = {In this article, we approached the study of spatiotemporal variation in
   trends for the monthly mean values of maximum and minimum temperatures
   on the Spanish mainland between 1951 and 2010, in order to find out how
   length and selected periods affected trends. The trend and significance
   signals were calculated every month and for each cell individually, in a
   high spatial resolution grid (Mann-Kendall test) by using decreasing and
   increasing temporal windows (from 20 to 60 years and vice versa).
   Finally, the results are presented as a sequence of temporal window
   trend maps to show the spatiotemporal variability of trends at high
   resolution over the years. The results of increasing temporal window
   trends show that temperatures have increased overall on the Spanish
   mainland, but the impact is different for cold and warm months, maximum
   and minimum temperatures, and the area affected by significant trends
   varies depending on the month. The positive and significant trend
   affecting >20\% of the total area extends in a west-east gradient during
   the cold months, while the reverse is true for the warmest ones. The
   analyses from decreasing the length of moving windows also vary greatly
   among months. The areas affected by significant trends are highly
   variable month-on-month, differ for maximum and minimum temperatures,
   and evolve in different ways over time. Few months show a significant
   trend during the last 30 years, and spatial distribution differences
   among trends for the maximum and minimum temperatures are detected.
   Spatially, a more complex gradient can be observed, but the global
   east-west and west-east gradient can also be generally seen in the
   warmest or coldest months. These findings show that a selected period
   determines the final trend. Furthermore, the results suggest that recent
   warming processes on the Spanish mainland have high spatial variability
   that differs among months and maximum and minimum temperatures, and has
   not been constant.},

Title = {Porosity and sonic velocity depth trends of Eocene chalk in Atlantic

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {216-229},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We aimed to relate changes in porosity and sonic velocity data, measured
   on water-saturated Eocene chalks from 36 Ocean Drilling Program drill
   sites in the Atlantic Ocean, to vertical effective stress and thermal
   maturity. We considered only chalk of Eocene age to avoid possible
   influence of geological age on chalk compaction trends. For each depth,
   vertical effective stresses as defined by Terzaghi and by Blot were
   calculated. We used bottom-hole temperature data to calculate the
   time-temperature index of thermal maturity (TTI) as defined by Lopatin.
   Porosity and compressional wave velocity data were correlated to
   vertical effective stresses and to TTI.
   Our porosity data showed a broader porosity trend in the mechanical
   compaction zone, and the onset of the formation of limestone at a
   shallower burial depth than the porosity data of the Ontong Java Plateau
   chalk show. Our porosity data do not show or at least it is difficult to
   define a clear pore-stiffening contact cementation trend as the Ontong
   Java Plateau chalk. Mechanical compaction is the principal cause of
   porosity reduction (at shallow depths) in the studied Eocene chalk, at
   least down to about 5 MPa Terzaghi's effective stress corresponding to a
   porosity of about 35\%. This indicates that mechanical compaction is the
   principal agent of porosity reduction. Conversely, at deeper levels,
   porosity reduction is accompanied by a large increase in sonic velocity
   indicating pore-filling cementation. These deep changes are correlated
   with TTI. This indicates pore-filling cementation via an activation
   energy mechanism. We proposed a predictive equation for porosity
   reduction with burial stress. This equation is relevant for basin
   analysis and hydrocarbon exploration to predict porosity if sonic
   velocity data for subsurface chalk is available. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Oxygen-isotope trends and seawater temperature changes across the Late

Journal = {GEOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {10},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The globally recognized Late Cambrian Steptoean positive C-isotope
   excursion (SPICE) is characterized by a 3 parts per thousand-5 parts per
   thousand positive delta C-13 shift spanning <4 m.y. Existing hypotheses
   suggest that the SPICE represents a widespread ocean anoxic event
   leading to enhanced burial/preservation of organic matter (C-org) and
   pyrite. We analyzed delta O-18 values of apatitic inarticulate
   brachiopods from three Upper Cambrian successions across Laurentia to
   evaluate paleotemperatures during the SPICE. delta O-18 values range
   from similar to 12.5 parts per thousand to 16.5 parts per thousand.
   Estimated seawater temperatures associated with the SPICE are
   unreasonably warm, suggesting that the brachiopod delta O-18 values were
   altered during early diagenesis. Despite this, all three localities show
   similar trends with respect to the SPICE delta C-13 curve, suggesting
   that the brachiopod apatite preserves a record of relative delta O-18
   and temperature changes. The trends include relatively high delta O-18
   values at the onset of the SPICE, decreasing and lowest values during
   the main event, and an increase in values at the end of the event. The
   higher delta O-18 values during the global extinction at the onset of
   the SPICE suggests seawater cooling and supports earlier hypotheses of
   upwelling of cool waters onto the shallow shelf. Decreasing and low
   delta O-18 values coincident with the rising limb of the SPICE support
   the hypothesis that seawater warming and associated reduced thermohaline
   circulation rates contributed to decreased dissolved O-2 concentrations,
   which enhanced the preservation/burial of C-org causing the positive
   delta C-13 shift.},

Title = {Trends in long-term gaseous mercury observations in the Arctic and

Abstract = {Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) measurements at Alert, Canada, from 1995
   to 2007 were analyzed for statistical time trends and for correlations
   with meteorological and climate data. A significant decreasing trend in
   annual GEM concentration is reported at Alert, with an estimated slope
   of -0.0086 ng m(-3) yr(-1) (-0.6\% yr(-1)) over this 13-year period. It
   is shown that there has been a shift in the month of minimum mean GEM
   concentration from May to April due to a change in the timing of
   springtime atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs). These AMDEs are
   found to decrease with increasing local temperature within each month,
   both at Alert and at Amderma, Russia. These results support the
   temperature dependence suggested by previous experimental results and
   theoretical kinetic calculations on both bromine generation and mercury
   oxidation and highlight the potential for changes in Arctic mercury
   chemistry with climate. A correlation between total monthly AMDEs at
   Alert and the Polar/Eurasian Teleconnection Index was observed only in
   March, perhaps due to higher GEM inputs in early spring in those years
   with a weak polar vortex. A correlation of AMDEs at Alert with wind
   direction supports the origin of mercury depletion events over the
   Arctic Ocean, in agreement with a previous trajectory study of ozone
   depletion events. Interannual variability in total monthly depletion
   event frequency at Alert does not appear to correlate significantly with

   and their relationship with temperature - can be used as additional

Abstract = {Trends in short-lived high-temperature extremes record a different
   dimension of change than the extensively studied annual and seasonal
   mean daily temperatures. They also have important socioeconomic,
   environmental, and human health implications. Here, we present analysis
   of the highest temperature of the year for approximately 9000 stations
   globally, focusing on quantifying spatially explicit exceedance
   probabilities during the recent 50- and 30-year periods. A global
   increase of 0.19 degrees C per decade during the past 50 years (through
   2015) accelerated to 0.25 degrees C per decade during the last 30 years,
   a faster increase than in the mean annual temperature. Strong positive
   30-year trends are detected in large regions of Eurasia and Australia
   with rates higher than 0.60 degrees C per decade. In cities with more
   than 5 million inhabitants, where most heat-related fatalities occur,
   the average change is 0.33 degrees C per decade, while some east Asia
   cities, Paris, Moscow, and Houston have experienced changes higher than
   0.60 degrees C per decade.},

Title = {Temperature Trend Patterns in Southern Hemisphere High Latitudes: Novel
   Indicators of Stratospheric Change (vol 22, pg 6325, 2009)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {23},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Robust stratospheric temperature trend patterns are suggested in the
   winter and spring seasons in the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes from
   the satellite-borne Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) measurement for
   1979-2007. These patterns serve as indicators of key processes governing
   temperature and ozone changes in the Antarctic. The observed patterns
   are characterized by cooling and warming regions of comparable
   magnitudes, with the strongest local trends occurring in September and
   October. In September, ozone depletion induces radiative cooling, and
   strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) induces dynamical
   warming. Because the trends induced by these two processes are centered
   in different locations in September, they do not cancel each other, but
   rather produce a wavelike structure. In contrast, during October, the
   ozone-induced radiative cooling and the BDC-induced warming exhibit a
   more zonally symmetric structure than in September, and hence largely
   cancel each other. However, the October quasi-stationary planetary
   wavenumber 1 has shifted eastward from 1979 to 2007, producing a zonal
   wavenumber-1 trend structure, which dominates the observed temperature
   trend pattern.
   Simulated temperature changes for 1979-2007 from coupled atmosphere
   ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) experiments run for the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC
   AR4) are compared with the observations. In general, the simulated
   temperature changes are dominated by zonally symmetric ozone-induced
   radiative cooling. The models fail to simulate the warming in the
   southern polar stratosphere, implying a lack of the BDC strengthening in
   these models. They also fail to simulate the quasi-stationary planetary
   wave changes observed in October and November.},

Title = {High temperature superconducting cables and their performance against

   future trends},
Journal = {SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Along with advancements in superconducting technology, especially in
   high-temperature superconductors (HTSs), the use of these materials in
   power system applications is gaining outstanding attention. Due to the
   lower weight, capability of carrying higher currents, and the lower loss
   characteristic of HTS cables, compared to conventional counterparts,
   they are among the most focused large-scale applications of
   superconductors in power systems and transportation units. In near
   future, these cables will be installed as key elements not only in power
   systems but also in cryo-electrified transportation units, that take
   advantage of both cryogenics and superconducting technology
   simultaneously, e.g., hydrogen-powered aircraft. Given the sensitivity
   of the reliable and continuous performance of HTS cables, any failures,
   caused by faults, could be catastrophic, if they are not designed
   appropriately. Thus, fault analysis of superconducting cables is crucial
   for ensuring their safety, reliability, and stability, and also for
   characterising the behaviour of HTS cables under fault currents at the
   design stage. Many investigations have been conducted on the fault
   characterisation and analysis of HTS cables in the last few years. This
   paper aims to provide a topical review on all of these conducted
   studies, and will discuss the current challenges of HTS cables and after
   that current developments of fault behaviour of HTS cables will be
   presented, and then we will discuss the future trends and future
   challenges of superconducting cables regarding their fault performance.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Lakes are particularly vulnerable ecosystems to global warming. Surface
   temperature of most lakes in the world has significantly increased.
   Here, we analysed time-series of water temperature, mixing-depth, and
   ice depth of 51 European lakes over the last four decades. We used data
   of surface temperature, total layer water temperature, mix-layer
   temperature, mix-layer depth, and ice cover depth obtained from the
   ERA5-land reanalysis dataset. Our main objectives were a) to identify
   significant changes of the examined variables that have occurred from
   1981 to 2019 and h) to assess the variability of changes in relation
   with geographical and lake morphological gradients. To this end, time
   series analysis was conducted using generalized additive models (GAMs).
   In addition, we quantified the magnitude of change by estimating the
   Sen's slopes for each variable and then we examined the variability of
   these slopes to geographical and lake morphological parameters using
   GAMs. Our results confirmed that water temperature parameters (surface,
   total-layer and mix-layer temperature) have significantly increased for
   all lakes during the last four decades. We also found significant
   changes of the mixing depth for 14 lakes. In addition, the lake ice
   depth has significantly decreased in all fifteen lakes of the subarctic
   climate region. Finally, we showed that the Seds slopes depend on the
   geographic coordinates and the elevation of the lakes, whereas lake
   morphometry (e.g. depth has a smaller effect on the magnitude of
   changes. These findings hint that lake ecosystems of Europe have
   substantially changed over the last forty years and urge the need to
   take precautionary measures to prevent future implications for the
   freshwater biota.},

Abstract = {Time series (TS) clustering is a crucial area of data mining that can be
   used to identify interesting patterns. This study introduces a novel
   approach to obtain clusters of TS by representing them with feature
   vectors that define the trend, seasonality and noise components of each
   series in order to identify areas of the Iberian Peninsula (IP) that
   follow the same pattern of change in regards to maximum temperature
   during 1931-2009. This representation allows for dimensionality
   reduction, and is obtained based on singular spectrum analysis
   decomposition in a sequential manner, which is a well-developed
   methodology of TS analysis and forecasting with applications ranging
   from the decomposition and filtering of nonparametric TS to parameter
   estimation and forecasting. In this approach, the trend, seasonality and
   residual components of each TS corresponding to a specific area in the
   Iberian region are extracted using the proposed SSA methodology.
   Afterwards, the feature vectors of the TS are obtained by modelling the
   extracted components and estimating their parameters. Finally, a
   clustering algorithm is applied to group the TS into clusters, which are
   defined according to the centroids. This methodology is applied to a
   climate database with reasonable results that align with the defined
   characteristics, enabling a spatial exploration of the IP. The results
   identified three differentiated zones that can be used to describe how
   the maximum temperature varied: in the northern and central zones, an
   increase in temperature was noted over time, whereas in the southern
   zone, a slight decrease was noted. Moreover, different seasonal
   variations were observed across the zones.},

Title = {Current and Potential Future Seasonal Trends of Indoor Dwelling
   Temperature and Likely Health Risks in Rural Southern Africa},

Abstract = {Climate change has resulted in rising temperature trends which have been
   associated with changes in temperature extremes globally. Attendees of
   Conference of the Parties (COP) 21 agreed to strive to limit the rise in
   global average temperatures to below 2 degrees C compared to industrial
   conditions, the target being 1.5 degrees C. However, current research
   suggests that the African region will be subjected to more intense heat
   extremes over a shorter time period, with projections predicting
   increases of 4-6 degrees C for the period 2071-2100, in annual average
   maximum temperatures for southern Africa. Increased temperatures may
   exacerbate existing chronic ill health conditions such as cardiovascular
   disease, respiratory disease, cerebrovascular disease, and
   diabetes-related conditions. Exposure to extreme temperatures has also
   been associated with mortality. This study aimed to consider the
   relationship between temperatures in indoor and outdoor environments in
   a rural residential setting in a current climate and warmer predicted
   future climate. Temperature and humidity measurements were collected
   hourly in 406 homes in summer and spring and at two-hour intervals in 98
   homes in winter. Ambient temperature, humidity and windspeed were
   obtained from the nearest weather station. Regression models were used
   to identify predictors of indoor apparent temperature (AT) and to
   estimate future indoor AT using projected ambient temperatures. Ambient
   temperatures will increase by a mean of 4.6 degrees C for the period
   2088-2099. Warming in winter was projected to be greater than warming in
   summer and spring. The number of days during which indoor AT will be
   categorized as potentially harmful will increase in the future.
   Understanding current and future heat-related health effects is key in
   developing an effective surveillance system. The observations of this
   study can be used to inform the development and implementation of
   policies and practices around heat and health especially in rural areas
   of South Africa.},

Abstract = {This study provides an assessment of recent changes in near-surface air
   temperature over the central Adriatic region of Italy, focusing on
   extreme events at annual and seasonal scales. It investigates trends in
   selected indices calculated from quality controlled and homogenized
   daily temperature data recorded from 1980 to 2012 at 34 meteorological
   stations distributed over the territory. The results reveal overall
   warming tendencies, particularly pronounced in spring and summer, with
   significant increases in the duration of warm spells (WSDI) and in the
   frequency of warm days (TX90p) and warm nights (TN90p), summer days (SU)
   and tropical nights (TR). Moreover, cold-related extremes (cold spell
   duration (CSDI), cool days (TX10p) and cool nights (TN10p), frost days
   (FD) and icing days (ID)) show significant reductions, although of lower
   magnitudes, thus confirming the recent warming over the study domain.
   Prevalent increasing tendencies are also observed for absolute extreme
   temperature indices (highest and lowest daily values of maximum and
   minimum temperatures), but with more mixed and less uniform spatial
   patterns. Finally, the influence of large-scale circulation modes on
   temperature extremes is examined. The results highlight the presence of
   significant correlations between most of the selected extreme
   temperature indices and the East-Atlantic pattern, in particular for the
   warm season.},

   one decade of meteor radar observations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},

Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Temperatures at 90 km altitude above Svalbard (78 degrees N, 16 degrees
   E) have been determined using a meteor wind radar and subsequently
   calibrated by satellite measurements for the period autumn 2001 to
   present. The dependence of the temperatures on solar driving has been
   investigated using the Ottawa 10.7 cm flux as a proxy. Removing the
   response of the temperatures to the seasonal and solar cycle variations
   yields a residual time series which exhibits the negative trend of -4
   +/- 2 K decade(-1). We indicate that, given the month-to-month
   variability and memory in the time series, for a 90\% confidence in this
   trend, we require only 55 months of data - considerably less than the
   amount available. Cooling of the middle atmosphere, which would be
   strongly supported by these results, would result in contraction and
   subsequent lowering of pressure surfaces; we explain that including a
   negative trend in the pressure model used to obtain temperatures from
   meteor train echo fading times would also merely serve to augment the
   observed 90 km cooling.},

Title = {Trends and variability in vertical ozone and temperature profiles

Year = {1998},

Abstract = {A first analysis of trends in vertical ozone and temperature profiles
   from ozonesonde flights made at Lauder (45.045 degrees S, 169.684
   degrees E) between August 1986 and July 1996, is presented. To calculate
   the trends and determine the magnitude of the forcing mechanisms
   underlying the variability in ozone and temperature, a linear least
   squares regression model was applied to ozone mixing ratios, ozone
   number densities, and temperatures, interpolated onto 100 pressure
   levels from the surface (969 hPa/370 m) to 12.1 hPa (similar to 30.1
   km), similar to 300 geopotential meters apart. Ozone trends indicate
   wintertime upper tropospheric decreases of more than -30+/-24\% per
   decade (2 sigma), post vortex breakup trends in a-narrow altitude region
   above the tropopause of -20+/-20\% per decade (2 sigma), and positive
   trends of up to 30+/-14\% per decade (2 sigma) in the lower stratosphere
   during late winter, spring, and early summer. The predominant
   temperature trend is +1.5\% per decade and greater above the similar to
   50 hPa level during winter. Derived trends were sensitive to inclusion
   of tropopause height forcing which was found to influence ozone and
   temperature at a high level of statistical significance. Ozone at Lauder
   shows significant QBO dependence throughout the lower stratosphere
   during winter, spring, and early summer, but little or no dependence on
   the solar;cycle. Temperatures, however, show little dependence on QBO
   but were influenced by the solar cycle. The Mt. Pinatubo eruption had
   little influence on Lauder ozone but significantly cooled the
   troposphere. The ENSO cycle in ozone and temperature was weak except at
   the uppermost analysis levels.},

Journal = {EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Over the past thirty years, Nashik, India, witnessed rapid urbanization,
   elevating Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs). This study presents a
   comprehensive approach for analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of LST
   in Nashik by utilizing Thermal Infrared Radiation bands from LANDSAT
   datasets. Regional LST maps from mid-May in 1992, 2003, 2013, and 2022,
   produced using the single channel algorithm, analyze LST changes and
   distributions. Land Cover Maps are developed to analyse the LST changes
   across different Land Classes. Further, statistical relationships are
   established across LSTs and landscape indicators like Normalized
   Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index
   (NDBaI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized
   Difference Water Index (NDWI). A consistent increase in citywide LST is
   detected as the area coverage for hottest (40-45)degrees C LST band grew
   from 30.47 km2 in 1992 to 132.16 km2, 141.47 km2 and 174.85 km2 in 2003,
   2013 and 2022 respectively. In contrast the cooler (30-40)degrees C band
   coverages fell from 305.39 km2 in 1992 to 203.12 km2, 194.66 km2and
   144.82 km2 in 2003, 2013 and 2022 respectively. In 2022, an
   unprecedented 16.25 km2 area experienced extreme LST (45-50)degrees C, a
   trend unseen in prior decades. Noteworthy, Built-up areas and Barelands
   showed much higher (40-45)degrees C LSTs than vegetated areas and water
   bodies (30-40)degrees C. Statistical relations also affirm these
   patterns: Stronger LST corelations (rho = 0.66) to NDBI indicate higher
   temperatures in densely built-up areas. In comparison, negative LST
   correlations with NDVI (rho = -0.61) and NDWI (rho = -0.66) signify
   cooler zones with vegetation and water bodies. These findings emphasize
   water-rich areas with vegetation moderating temperatures, while built-up
   areas elevate heat. Thus, municipalities must prioritize awareness,
   green spaces, water conservation, cooling technologies, and zoning
   regulations to counteract this warming trend.},

Title = {Attribution of Recent Trends in Temperature Extremes over China: Role of
   Changes in Anthropogenic Aerosol Emissions over Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {32},
Number = {21},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Observations indicate large changes in temperature extremes over China
   during the last four decades, exhibiting as significant increases in the
   amplitude and frequency of hot extremes and decreases in the amplitude
   and frequency of cold extremes. An ensemble of transient experiments
   with the fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model HadGEM3-GC2, including
   both anthropogenic forcing and natural forcing, successfully reproduces
   the spatial pattern and magnitude of observed historical trends in both
   hot and cold extremes. The model-simulated trends in temperature
   extremes primarily come from the positive trends in clear-sky longwave
   radiation, which is mainly due to the increases in greenhouse gases
   (GHGs). An ensemble of sensitivity experiments with Asian anthropogenic
   aerosol (AA) emissions fixed at their 1970s levels tends to overestimate
   the trends in temperature extremes, indicating that local AA emission
   changes have moderated the trends in these temperature extremes over
   China. The recent increases in Asian AA drive cooling trends over China
   by inducing negative clear-sky shortwave radiation directly through the
   aerosol-radiation interaction, which partly offsets the strong warming
   effect by GHG changes. The cooling trends induced by Asian AA changes
   are weaker over northern China during summer, which is due to the
   warming effect by the positive shortwave cloud radiative effect through
   the AA-induced atmosphere-cloud feedback. This accounts for the observed
   north-south gradients of the historical trends in some temperature
   extremes over China, highlighting the importance of local Asian AA
   emission changes on spatial heterogeneity of trends in temperature
   extremes.},

Title = {Radiosonde-Observed Vertical Profiles and Increasing Trends of
   Temperature and Humidity during 2005-2018 at the South Pole},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The vertical profiles and trends of temperature and humidity at the
   South Pole up to 10 km above mean sea level (amsl) were investigated by
   using radiosonde data collected from March 2005 to February 2018. During
   an average year between 2005 and 2018, the highest (lowest) temperature
   in the lower troposphere was approximately -25 degrees C (-60 degrees C)
   in December (July) at a height of about 500 m above the surface (at the
   surface). A temperature inversion layer above the surface was found
   during the whole year but was weaker during the summer, while the
   inversion layers at the tropopause (about 8 km amsl) mostly disappeared
   during spring and winter. General warming trends were found at all
   heights and months, but in a few heights and months cooling trends still
   occurred (e.g., in September below 7 km amsl). Nevertheless, seasonal
   and yearly averaged temperatures all presented warming trends: 1.1, 1.3,
   0.6, 1.5 and 1.1 degrees C/decade at the surface, and 0.7, 1.0, 0.3, 0.3
   and 0.6 degrees C/decade for the layer average from the surface to 10 km
   amsl, for spring, summer, autumn, winter, and yearly average,
   respectively. Most of the water vapor was confined in the lowermost 3 km
   of the atmosphere with a maximum of 0.35 g kg(-1) in December at a 200 m
   height above surface, and the specific humidity had the similar
   characteristic of annual cycle and inversion layers as the temperature.
   At heights below 5 km amsl, increasing trends of specific humidity
   larger than 0.02 g kg(-1)/decade occurred during summer months,
   including the late spring and early autumn, and the annual mean showed
   an increasing trend of about 0.01-0.02 g kg(-1)/decade. Meanwhile, above
   5 km amsl, the trends became small and generally less than 0.02 g
   kg(-1)/decade in all the months, and beyond 7 km amsl the specific
   humidity remained almost invariant due to its small moisture content as
   compared with lower levels. From the surface to 10 km amsl, the specific
   humidity averaged trends of 0.0062, 0.019, 0.0013, 0.002 and 0.007 g
   kg(-1)/decade for spring, summer, autumn, winter and yearly average,
   respectively.},

Title = {Elevation-Dependent Temperature Trends in the Rocky Mountain Front
   Range: Changes over a 56-and 20-Year Record},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Determining the magnitude of climate change patterns across elevational
   gradients is essential for an improved understanding of broader climate
   change patterns and for predicting hydrologic and ecosystem changes. We
   present temperature trends from five long-term weather stations along a
   2077-meter elevational transect in the Rocky Mountain Front Range of
   Colorado, USA. These trends were measured over two time periods: a full
   56-year record (1953-2008) and a shorter 20-year (1989-2008) record
   representing a period of widely reported accelerating change. The rate
   of change of biological indicators, season length and accumulated
   growing-degree days, were also measured over the 56 and 20-year records.
   Finally, we compared how well interpolated Parameter-elevation
   Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) datasets match the
   quality controlled and weather data from each station. Our results show
   that warming signals were strongest at mid-elevations over both temporal
   scales. Over the 56-year record, most sites show warming occurring
   largely through increases in maximum temperatures, while the 20-year
   record documents warming associated with increases in maximum
   temperatures at lower elevations and increases in minimum temperatures
   at higher elevations. Recent decades have also shown a shift from
   warming during springtime to warming in July and November. Warming along
   the gradient has contributed to increases in growing-degree days,
   although to differing degrees, over both temporal scales. However, the
   length of the growing season has remained unchanged. Finally, the actual
   and the PRISM interpolated yearly rates rarely showed strong
   correlations and suggest different warming and cooling trends at most
   sites. Interpretation of climate trends and their seasonal biases in the
   Rocky Mountain Front Range are dependent on both elevation and the
   temporal scale of analysis. Given mismatches between interpolated data
   and the directly measured station data, we caution against an
   over-reliance on interpolation methods for documenting local patterns of
   climatic change.},

Abstract = {The climatological means and surface air temperature (SAT) trends of the
   Indochina Peninsula (ICP) are being analyzed on a yearly and seasonal
   basis using a newly published observation dataset (SA-OBS). The SAT for
   the period 1981 to 2010 shows a north-south gradient over the ICP, with
   the highest mean annual temperature in the central plain and the lowest
   in the northern mountain region. In addition, over the past 30years, the
   ICP has been undergoing a significant warming trend of 0.37 degrees
   C/decade. The seasonal mean SAT fluctuations are significant in the dry
   seasons compared to the wet seasons, with a rapid increase in JFM
   (January to March) and OND (October to December). Further, comparisons
   are made using SA-OBS and the other observation (CRU, GHCN\_CAMS, DEL)
   or reanalysis (ERA-20C, CERA-20C, ERA-Interim, JRA-55) datasets. The
   result shows (i) that the SA-OBS dataset can capture the spatial
   distributions and temporal patterns reasonably well throughout the ICP
   on annual and seasonal scales. (ii) CERA-20C is very similar to SA-OBS
   in replicating the annual mean SAT over the ICP, suggesting that the
   ECMWF's coupled data assimilation system (CERA) could obviously improve
   the temperature estimates in that region. (iii) That significant
   differences, however, still exist between observations and reanalyses in
   annual and seasonal trends. These discrepancies need to be taken into
   account to study climate change and variability or to assess regional
   climate models with focus on the ICP.},

Abstract = {From indirect phase-height observations in the LF range at
   mid-latitudes, significant negative long-term trends of the ionospheric
   reflection height can be derived. The lowering of the reflection height
   at constant solar zenith angle can mainly be explained by a temperature
   decrease of the mesosphere due to increasing greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2)
   and a reduction of the atmospheric ozone content. Marked seasonal
   differences of the temperature trends could be found with a stronger
   cooling of the mesosphere in summer than in winter. A comparison of
   experimental trend results and model calculations with the
   three-dimensional global circulation model COMMA-IAP shows a reasonable
   agreement. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Climate change poses significant risks on coastal national park-based
   tourism through its effect on accessibility, comfort levels, and
   spatiotemporal changes of attractions. Wildfires and extreme
   temperatures have become issues of concern. Due to the widespread
   occurrence of fires in national parks along coastal areas and the
   noticeable changes in temperature regimes, more needs to be done to
   deepen understanding of their trends and impacts and devise appropriate
   management regimes. This study analyses the trends and impacts of fires
   and temperature-related variables in six coastal South African national
   parks, namely Agulhas, Garden Route, West Coast, Table Mountain,
   Namaqua, and Addo Elephant National Park. The triangulation and
   convergence model of the mixed-methods research design was adopted as
   the inquiry strategy. Data on statistical weather variables from the
   South African Weather Services and the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration were used to calculate temperature trends using
   Mann-Kendall trend tests and homogeneity analysis. Data collection
   included questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews, field
   observations, and document analysis. The study observed statistically
   significant (p < 0.05) changes in temperature-related variables in all
   coastal national parks. There is also an increase in the intensity and
   spatial spread of fires, resulting in increased fire damage over time.
   Despite the current efforts of the coastal parks to manage wildfires and
   the changing climatic patterns, the fire and temperature regimes are
   threatening the biophysical environment with resultant effects on
   tourism and the economic viability of the national parks. The need to
   reengineer the fire suppression mechanisms and temperature-resilient
   tourism facilities has been observed.},

Abstract = {The goal of the present paper is to investigate whether any objectively
   defined and statistically significant changes can be discovered in one
   of the longest homogenized instrumental temperature records in
   East-Central Europe. Thus, it is hoped that the present analysis will
   add to earlier attempts and elucidate the persistence of the warming
   period observed in the early 20th century. Similar to the global
   tendency, the Early Twentieth Century Warming (hereinafter, ETCW) period
   can be identified between 1931 and 1951 in the annual mean temperature
   time series of Keszthely, a small town in Hungary. The Mann-Kendall
   trend test was used to determine whether a monotonic trend was present,
   as it is not possible to regard the residuals of the linear trend as
   normally distributed. A significant rising trend can be observed in the
   warming period in spring of the years between 1925 and 1951. In case of
   summer and autumn, this period cannot be characterized as having any
   significant identifiable trend. A rise in the mean can, however, be
   recognized. Overall, the specific regional manifestation of the global
   ETCW may clearly be illustrated in this study via detailed statistical
   analysis of the temperature records for Keszthely, a location with one
   of the longest temperature records in Hungary. However, other regions
   surrounding Hungary show similar dimatic trends, emphasizing the fact
   that the behaviour presented here is not unique to Central and Eastern
   Europe.},

Abstract = {Within the United States, the Southwest USA deserts show the largest
   temperature changes (1901-2010) besides Alaska, according to the most
   recent USA National Climate Assessment report. The report does not
   discuss urban effects vs. regional effects that might be evident in
   trends. Twenty-five temperature stations with ca. 68-year records (1950
   to 2018) have been accessed from US Global Historical Climate Network
   archives. Land cover data are accessed from a National Land Cover
   Database. June results considering both urban and rural sites show an
   astounding rate per year change among sites ranging from -0.01 to 0.05
   degrees C for maximum temperatures and 0.01 to 0.11 degrees C for
   minimum temperatures (-0.8 to 3.2 degrees C, and 0.8 to 8.0 degrees C
   for the entire period). For maximum temperatures, almost half of the
   sites showed no significant trends at a stringent 0.01 level of
   statistical significance, but 20 of 25 were significant at the 0.05
   level. For minimum temperatures, over 75\% of sites were significant at
   the 0.01 level (92\% at 0.05 level of significance). The urban-dominated
   stations in Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson, and Yuma show large minimum
   temperature trends, indicating emerging heat island effects. Rural
   sites, by comparison, show much smaller trends. Addressing heat in our
   urban areas by local actions, through collaborations with stakeholders
   and political resolve, will aid in meeting future urban challenges in
   this era of projected global climate change and continued warming.},

Abstract = {The northwestern part of China has been experiencing significant
   ``warming{''} because of climate change. However, temperature changes
   are variable over the complex terrain in the Gansu Province, where
   significant heterogeneity can be observed at the surface, and this adds
   to regional instability regarding agricultural production and the
   ecological environment. Since there are few meteorological stations in
   this region, studies on climate change and the associated impacts have
   been difficult to conduct. Therefore, it is important to gather more
   information on the patterns of climate change in the region and the
   corresponding impacts. In this study, monthly average temperatures from
   1962 to 2011 were first calculated using original data that were
   recorded at 43 national meteorological stations in the Gansu Province
   and surrounding areas. Additionally, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
   Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data with a spatial
   resolution of 30m were combined with a global digital elevation model
   (GDEM). Missing values were compensated with averages of 5 x 5 adjacent
   pixels. Spatial resampling was conducted at a resolution of 1000m. Then,
   the spatial distribution of monthly average temperatures from January to
   December was generated using AUNSPLIN-elevation and longitude were used
   as independent variables and elevation is the covariate variable-and
   interpolated using the cubic-spline method. Lastly, the spatial analyst
   tool in Arc GIS 10.0 was used to obtain the spatial distribution
   characteristics of the average annual and seasonal (spring: April,
   summer: July, autumn: October, and winter: January) temperature changes
   in the Gansu Province over the 50-year period. Trend analyses were also
   conducted. Our results are as follows. (1) A significant warming trend
   was observed; the rate of temperature change in the Gansu Province over
   the last 50 years was 0.34 degrees C/10 a, which is slightly lower than
   that of the Tibetan Plateau (0.37 degrees C/10a) but much higher than
   that of the national warming average (0.23 degrees C/10a). (2)
   Significant seasonal temperature increases were detected; the seasonal
   temperature trends decreased in the order of summer (0.39 degrees C/10a)
   > spring (0.35 degrees C/10a) > autumn (0.22 degrees C/10a) > winter
   (0.19 degrees C/10a), which shows that winter is associated with a
   relatively low-rate temperature change. (3) The ANUSPLIN method improved
   interpolation accuracy. In the future, underlying surface factors should
   be introduced into the model to obtain vegetation index and land cover
   data for the same period based on remote sensing data and build a more
   comprehensive temperature estimation model.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Geological Survey and other federal and state agencies have
   been collecting continuous temperature and salinity data, two critical
   estuarine habitat variables, throughout San Francisco estuary for over
   two decades. Although this dynamic, highly variable system has been well
   studied, many questions remain relating to the effects of freshwater
   inflow and other physical and biological linkages. This study examines
   up to 20 years of publically available, continuous temperature and
   salinity data from 10 different San Francisco Bay stations to identify
   trends in temperature and salinity and quantify the salinity-freshwater
   inflow relationship. Several trends in the salinity and temperature
   records were identified, although the high degree of daily and
   interannual variability confounds the analysis. In addition, freshwater
   inflow to the estuary has a range of effects on salinity from -0.0020 to
   -0.0096 (m(3) s(-1)) (-1) discharge, depending on location in the
   estuary and the timescale of analyzed data. Finally, we documented that
   changes in freshwater inflow to the estuary that are within the range of
   typical management actions can affect bay-wide salinities by 0.6-1.4.
   This study reinforces the idea that multidecadal records are needed to
   identify trends from decadal changes in water management and climate
   and, therefore, are extremely valuable.},

Abstract = {The historical database (Published by IFREMER/DITI/IDT on behalf of the
   MEDATLAS consortium under contract MAS2-CT93-0074, 1997) is analysed on
   a seasonal basis for trends in the surface and intermediate water masses
   of the Mediterranean Sea. Significant trends are found in both the East
   and West Mediterranean but often to differing degrees. The upper waters
   of the entire Eastern Mediterranean Basin have been undergoing a
   sustained period of cooling throughout all seasons since about 1950.
   Salinities have also been found to be increasing over the same period
   with the strongest trends often being found at the shallowest horizontal
   levels examined. The Western Mediterranean Basin exhibits the same
   salinification throughout the upper waters as seen in the Eastern
   Mediterranean but the temperature trends are more varied and a basin
   wide cooling is not evident. The origin of these trends is most likely
   related to changes in the large-scale meteorological forcing of the
   Mediterranean region. The magnitude of changes to Levantine Intermediate
   Water (LIW) are in fact smaller than previously suggested thus
   indicating that the transfer of properties from the East to West
   Mediterranean via the LIW is not the major contributor to changes in the
   deep water characteristics of the Western Mediterranean. (C) 2003

Abstract = {This study highlights significant recent increases in water and air
   temperatures in the rapidly developing city of Belgrade, Serbia to raise
   awareness of the anticipated negative impacts and the urgent need to
   develop appropriate mitigation strategies. We investigate the mean
   annual water temperature trends at the confluence of the Sava and Danube
   Rivers, along with air temperature trends at the Belgrade meteorological
   station, spanning from 1956 to 2020. Results reveal a consistent
   increase in temperature across all three measuring stations, with the
   Danube experiencing a rise of 0.34 degrees C/decade, the Sava at 0.44
   degrees C/decade, and Belgrade's air temperature increasing by 0.39
   degrees C/decade. Employing the Rescaled Adjusted Partial Sums method,
   sharp rises in water temperature were pinpointed in 1989 for the Sava
   and 1990 for the Danube, while Belgrade's air temperature surge began in
   1998. The highest intensity of air temperature increase within the
   recent period (1998-2020) was observed at the Belgrade observatory,
   reaching 0.76 degrees C/decade. Notably, the Sava exhibited a faster
   increase in water temperature over the last thirty years compared to the
   Danube. August marked the peak average water temperature for both
   rivers, while July recorded the highest average air temperature in
   Belgrade. Despite differing flow rates, both rivers exhibit similar
   hydrological regimes, with maximum flows occurring in April and minimum
   flows in August for the Sava, and October for the Danube. Seasonal
   temperature increases were most pronounced in summer, notably in August,
   with the smallest rises occurring during cold periods. Additionally, an
   inverse proportional relationship between mean annual water temperatures
   and discharges was observed at both river stations. The overall findings
   suggest that the increase in both air and water temperatures is more
   pronounced during the warmer part of the year.},

Title = {Evaluation of Consistency Among MODIS Land Surface Temperature Products
   for Monitoring Surface Warming Trend Over the Tibetan Plateau},
Journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua
   daily land surface temperature (LST) products are important data sets
   for global warming monitoring. To reveal the consistency and differences
   between MODIS Terra and Aqua daily LST products for monitoring LST
   trends, this study used these two products to extract the mean annual
   surface temperature (MAST) of the Tibetan Plateau from 2003 to 2020.
   Then, nine MAST combinations were constructed for daytime, nighttime,
   and daily average conditions separately with Terra and Aqua MAST series,
   including Terra only, Aqua only, and the integrated one. Finally, the
   Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to these series and obtained the
   spatiotemporal variability. The results indicated that there was high
   spatial consistency of the multi-year averaged MAST of different
   combinations at daytime/nighttime/daily average scales. Meanwhile, there
   are quite similar temporal trends in terms of spatial distribution and
   change rate. The MAST changes are dominated by warming trends, and the
   areas and change rates of the significant changing pixels at different
   elevations, vegetation cover ranges, and land cover types presented
   similar distribution patterns. Although there are some discrepancies in
   the detailed location for pixels with significant trends among different
   combinations, the proportion of the pixels with the same trends of
   daytime/nighttime/daily-average groups is as high as 68.88\%, 66.75\%,
   and 71.76\%, respectively. These findings reveal that different MODIS
   LST products have similar performance in monitoring LST trends,
   indicating that the detection can well reflect the variation of surface
   thermal environment regardless of which MODIS LST product is used.},

Title = {Extreme temperature trend and return period mapping in a changing
   climate in Upper Tekeze river basin, Northern Ethiopia},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {There is a consensus that global warming leads to the frequent
   occurrence of extreme temperature events that significantly impact human
   life, water resources, agricultural production, and ecosystems. However,
   the magnitudes of projected temperatures and the probabilities of
   extreme event occurrences are still deficient for robust planning and
   early warning efforts at major river basins. This study aimed to analyze
   extreme temperature trends and mapping return periods in a changing
   climate for the case of the upper Tekeze river basin, Northern Ethiopia.
   The future temperature is projected based on global climate models
   (GCMs) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The annual extreme
   temperatures were obtained from the daily temperature data series for
   the 12 stations by applying the block maxima series method. The
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall (M-K) statistical test was used for trend
   detection. The inverse distance weighted (IDW) method has been used to
   interpolate the point data and reveal the spatial patterns of the
   extreme temperature of the 50-year return period. The result shows the
   future extreme temperature will rise by 0.6-2.2 degrees C. Moreover, the
   future extreme temperature revealed a significant increasing trend in
   most of the stations (around 66.3\%). The spatial extent of the 50-year
   return period of the extreme temperature map showed that in the future
   (2022-2051), the extreme temperature will be increased by 0.2-3.4
   degrees C compared to the baseline period (1980-2009). The extreme
   temperature trend and return period mapping under climate change will
   help better local plans and fine-tune mitigation and adaptation
   measures.},

Abstract = {The effect of urbanization on the urban thermal environment (UTE) has
   attracted increasing research attention because its significant effects
   on local weather and climate, and serious consequences for people.
   However, systematic study of the relationship between urbanization and
   UTE has been undertaken only to a limited extent. Using quantitative
   thermal remote sensing and multi-buffer ring method and multiple spatial
   scales method, here we analyze Landsat TM/ETM+ images of Zhengzhou in
   Central China acquired on four different dates in 2017 to investigate
   the spatiotemporal variations, trends, and driving force in the land
   surface temperature (LST). Our results showed that LST generally
   increased with urbanization intensity. This trend was extremely obvious
   in spring and summer, weak in winter, and slightly downward in autumn.
   Moreover, PLAND (e.g., percentage of impervious surface in a landscape)
   has the most significant effect on urban LST, and generally increases as
   the spatial scale becomes larger. In conclusion, the study recommends
   that urban planning in Zhengzhou should prioritize PLAND, especially at
   large spatial scales. These results provide a scientific reference for
   urban planners who are committed to the sustainable development of
   Zhengzhou City.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the spatial and temporal trends of diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) for 35-years (1983-2017) in the region of the
   Subarnarekha river basin of Jharkhand, India. The daily data of maximum
   temperature (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) were habituated to
   compute the DTR, whereas rainfall data is used to measure its
   relationship with DTR, on a monthly annual and seasonal basis.
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope method has been used to detect the
   increasing or decreasing trends in climatic data with their statistical
   significance. The annual mean DTR of the basin is 11.97 degrees C With a
   maximum in pre-monsoon (16.36 degrees C) and minimum in monsoon (6.94
   degrees C). A significant negative trend (- 0.31 degrees C/decade) was
   observed in annual DTR over the basin. On a seasonal basis, all four
   seasons show a negative trend in DTR with the largest significant
   decreasing trend in the pre-monsoon season (- 0.49 degrees C/decade). On
   an annual and seasonal basis, a significant negative correlation between
   DTR and rainfall is found, indicating that rainfall has a significant
   impact on the variation of DTR in this basin. A concomitant increase in
   rainfall might be one of the possible causes of the decreases in DTR in
   the basin.},

Title = {Monitoring and trend mapping of sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS
   data: a case study of Mumbai coast},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {187},

Abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important parameters in
   monitoring ecosystem health in the marine and coastal environment.
   Coastal ecosystem is largely dependent on ambient temperature and
   temperature fronts for marine/coastal habitat and its sustainability.
   Hence, thermal pollution is seen as a severe threat for ecological
   health of coastal waters across the world. Mumbai is one of the largest
   metropolises of the world and faces severe domestic and industrial
   effluent disposal problem, of which thermal pollution is a major issue
   with policy-makers and environmental stakeholders. This study attempts
   to understand the long-term SST variation in the coastal waters off
   Mumbai, on the western coast of India, and to identify thermal pollution
   zones. Analysis of SST trends in the near-coastal waters for the pre-and
   postmonsoon seasons from the year 2004 to the year 2010 has been carried
   out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Thermal
   Infra-red (TIR) bands. SST is calculated with the help of bands 31 and
   32 using split window method. Several statistical operations were then
   applied to find the seasonal averages in SST and the standard deviation
   of SST in the study area. Maximumvariation in SSTwas found within a
   perpendicular distance of 5 km from the shoreline during the study
   period. Also, a warm water mass was found to form consistently off coast
   during the winter months. Several anthropogenic sources of thermal
   pollution could be identified which were found to impact various
   locations along the coast.},

Title = {Past and future trends of diurnal temperature range and their
   correlation with vegetation assessed by MODIS and CMIP6},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {904},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Temperature anomalies and changes in the diurnal temperature range (DTR)
   are expected to pose physiological challenges to biota; hence, both
   spatial and temporal variations in DTR provide important insights into
   temperature -induced stress in humans, animals, and vegetation.
   Furthermore, vegetation could dampen temperature variability. Here, we
   use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote
   sensing data of Land Surface Temperature (LST) to evaluate the global
   variation in DTR and its rate of change in spatial and temporal scales
   for the two decades spanning from 2001 to 2020. We show that North
   America, Africa, and Antarctica, as well as the global mean, experienced
   statistically significant DTR rates of change over the last 20 years in
   either summer, winter, or the annual mean. The rates were all negative,
   indicating the day -night temperature differences are decreasing in
   those regions because night temperatures are increasing at a faster rate
   than day temperatures. MODIS data of the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) revealed a strongly negative correlation with
   DTR, with a spatial correlation coefficient of -0.61. This correlation
   demonstrates a prominent dampening effect of vegetation on diurnal
   temperature oscillations. For future DTR projections, we used 19 models
   in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) to predict global
   DTR trends from 2021 to 2050 with low and high CO2 concentration
   scenarios. The high CO2 emission scenario projects significant decreases
   in DTR in circumpolar regions, central Africa, and India compared to the
   low CO2 scenario. This difference in the two scenarios underscores the
   substantial influence of increased global temperatures and elevated CO2
   concentration on DTR and, consequently, on the ecosystems in certain
   regions.},

Abstract = {Gridded temperature datasets covering the UK at 5 km x 5 km resolution
   have been analysed for temporal and spatial patterns of change and
   variability. Decadal-scale variability is visualized by smoothing the
   data series using a kernel smoother. Trends have been analysed by
   comparing averages for a baseline period with averages for a recent
   period, as well as using linear regression. Spatial patterns of change
   have been mapped by calculating trends for each grid point. Monthly
   gridded datasets of daily maximum, minimum and mean air temperatures are
   available from 1910 to date. These show statistically significant
   increases for all parts of the UK, with the rate of change increasing
   from the north and west to the south and east. Seasonally, the least
   significant changes have occurred in the winter, with significant
   increases for most districts for all of the other seasons. Derived
   indices based on daily temperature are available from 1961 onwards.
   There have been significant decreases in heating degree days and
   increases in growing degree days for all districts, while changes in
   cooling degree days are less significant as the values are low and
   inter-annual variability dominates. There have been significant
   decreases in frost days, especially in spring and autumn, and this is
   linked to significant increases in growing season length, especially for
   Scotland.},

Abstract = {Objective Transpulmonary ultrasound dilution (TPUD) is a minimally
   invasive technique to measure cardiac output (CO) using a 1 mL kg -1
   isotonic 37 degrees C saline injectate in-dicator. The objective was to
   evaluate the performance of TPUD using a room temperature saline
   injectate. Study design Prospective experimental trial. Animals A total
   of seven anesthetized male Yorkshire piglets.Methods Piglets aged 1
   month and weighing 7.7-9.0 kg were anesthetized with
   detomidine-ketamine- hydromorphone-isoflurane and a pulmonary artery
   flow probe (PAFP) placed via a median sternotomy. The thoracic cavity
   remained open during measurement of CO by PAFP and TPUD. The TPUD
   indicators of 1 mL kg -1 0.9\% saline at 37 degrees C and 20 degrees C
   were compared during infusions of phen-ylephrine and dobutamine, blood
   withdrawal and replace-ment. Bias, limits of agreement (LoAs) and
   percentage error (PE) between each iteration of PAFP and TPUD were
   measured with Bland -Altman plots. Trending ability via concordance,
   angular bias and radial LoA were compared. Results Bland -Altman plots
   showed negligible bias with varying LoAs. PEs of 22\% and 38\% were
   found for 37 degrees C and 20 degrees C saline injectates, respectively.
   In the four -quadrant plots, the concordance rate was 94\% and 100\% for
   measurements obtained with 37 degrees C and 20 degrees C saline
   injectates, respectively. Angular bias for both were < +/- 5 degrees,
   with radial LoA < +/- 7 degrees. Conclusions TPUD was accurate when
   using 1 mL kg -1 of isotonic saline at 37 degrees C in a range of CO
   within 0.2-0.8 L minute -1, and it reliably tracked positive and
   negative changes in CO. Room temperature (20 degrees C) indicator was
   less accurate but equally able to track direction of changes in CO.},

Volume = {160},

Abstract = {Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) are sensitive to climate change,
   but previous studies have typically focused on temperatures from only
   the last few decades. Thus, while there is good appreciation of LSWT
   warming in recent decades, our understanding of longer-term temperature
   change is comparatively limited. In this study, we use a mechanistically
   based open-source model (air2water), driven by air temperature from a
   state-of-the-art global atmospheric reanalysis (ERA-20C) and calibrated
   with satellite-derived LSWT observations (ARC-Lake v3), to investigate
   the long-term change in LSWT worldwide. The predictive ability of the
   model is tested across 606 lakes, with 91\% of the lakes showing a daily
   root mean square error smaller than 1.5 degrees C. Model performance was
   better at mid-latitudes and decreased towards the equator. The results
   illustrated highly variable mean annual LSWT trends during the twentieth
   century and across climatic regions. Substantial warming is evident
   after similar to 1980 and the most responsive lakes to climate change
   are located in the temperate regions.},

Abstract = {The analyses of temperature extremes can be very useful because they are
   highly representative of the climatic tendency of an area. In this
   study, 19 temperature series registered in southern Italy have been
   analysed for detecting trends through the Mann-Kendall non-parametric

   minimum monthly temperatures and for several indices of daily extremes.
   As a result, the minimum and maximum monthly temperatures mainly denote
   a positive trend for spring and summer months and a marked negative one
   in September. Moreover, the trend analysis on the extreme temperature
   indices shows opposite behaviours: a clear positive tendency in the
   frequency and intensity of the highest values and some negative trends
   for the lowest ones.},

Abstract = {A new static microwave sounding unit (MSU) channel 4 weighting function
   is obtained from using Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project, Phase 5
   (CMIP5) historical multimodel simulations as inputs into the fast
   Radiative Transfer Model for TOVS (RTTOV v10). For the same CMIP5 model
   simulations, it is demonstrated that the computed MSU channel 4
   brightness temperature (T4) trends in the lower stratosphere over both
   the globe and the tropics using the proposed weighting function are
   equivalent to those calculated by RTTOV, but show more cooling than
   those computed using the traditional UAH (University of Alabama at
   Huntsville) or RSS (Remote Sensing Systems in Santa Rosa, California)
   static weighting functions. The new static weighting function not only
   reduces the computational cost, but also reveals reasons why trends
   using a radiative transfer model are different from those using a
   traditional static weighting function. This study also shows that CMIP5
   model simulated T4 trends using the traditional UAH or RSS static
   weighting functions show less cooling than satellite observations over
   the globe and the tropics. Although not completely removed, this
   difference can be reduced using the proposed weighting function to some
   extent, especially over the tropics. This work aims to explore the
   reasons for the trend differences and to see to what extent they are
   related to the inaccurate weighting functions. This would also help
   distinguish other sources for trend errors and thus better understand
   the climate change in the lower stratosphere.},

Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2009},

Abstract = {Elevation dependency of climate change signals has been found over major
   mountain ranges such as the European Alps and the Rockies, as well as
   over the Tibetan Plateau. In this study we examined the temporal trends
   in monthly mean minimum temperatures from 116 weather stations in the
   eastern Tibetan Plateau and its vicinity during 1961-2006. We also
   analyzed projected climate changes in the entire Tibetan Plateau and its
   surroundings from two sets of modeling experiments under future global
   warming conditions. These analyses included the output of the NCAR
   Community Climate System Model (CCSM3) with approximately 150 km
   horizontal resolution for the scenario of annual 1\% increase in
   atmospheric CO2 for future 100 years and physically-based downscaling
   results from the NCAR CAM3/CLM3 model at 10' x 10' resolution during
   three 20-year mean periods (1980-1999, 2030-2049 and 2080-2099) for the
   IPCC mid-range emission (A1B) scenario. We divided the 116 weather
   stations and the regional model grids into elevation zones of 500 m
   interval to examine the relationship of climatic warming and elevation.
   With these corroborating datasets, we were able to confirm the elevation
   dependency in monthly mean minimum temperature in and around the Tibetan
   Plateau. The warming is more prominent at higher elevations than at
   lower elevations, especially during winter and spring seasons, and such
   a tendency may continue in future climate change scenarios. The
   elevation dependency is most likely caused by the combined effects of
   cloud-radiation and snow-albedo feedbacks among various influencing
   factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Waste incineration is an important component of solid waste management
   systems in cities worldwide, offering advantages such as rapid waste
   volume reduction, heat recovery, and power generation. However, the
   power efficiency of waste-to-energy plants is relatively low, primarily
   due to constraints imposed by high-temperature corrosion. The
   temperature and gas composition in the waste incineration boiler are
   critical factors affecting high-temperature corrosion. Therefore, a
   comprehensive review of the behavior of temperature and gas composition
   during incineration is needed. From the perspective of influencing
   factors on high-temperature corrosion, this article provides an overview
   of the corrosion mechanisms and existing coating research under
   different factors, such as temperature and gas composition (chlorine,
   sulfur, fluorine, bromine) present in waste incineration boilers. The
   article identifies current research and application challenges and
   prospects for future development trends, offering important reference
   value for the further application and promotion of metal coatings in

Title = {Research on Classification Algorithm of Silicon Single-Crystal Growth
   Temperature Gradient Trend Based on Multi-Level Feature Fusion},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the process of silicon single-crystal preparation, the timely
   identification and adjustment of abnormal conditions are crucial.
   Failure to promptly detect and resolve issues may result in a
   substandard silicon crystal product quality or even crystal pulling
   failure. Therefore, the early identification of abnormal furnace
   conditions is essential for ensuring the preparation of perfect silicon
   single crystals. Additionally, since the thermal field is the
   fundamental driving force for stable crystal growth and the primary
   assurance of crystal quality, this paper proposes a silicon
   single-crystal growth temperature gradient trend classification
   algorithm based on multi-level feature fusion. The aim is to accurately
   identify temperature gradient changes during silicon crystal growth, in
   order to promptly react to early growth failures and ensure the stable
   growth of high-quality silicon single crystals to meet industrial
   production requirements. The algorithm first divides the temperature
   gradient trend into reasonable categories based on expert knowledge and
   qualitative analysis methods. Then, it fuses the original features of
   actual production data, shallow features extracted based on statistical
   information, and deep features extracted through deep learning. During
   the fusion process, the algorithm considers the impact of different
   features on the target variable and calculates mutual information based
   on the difference between information entropy and conditional entropy,
   ultimately using mutual information for feature weighting. Subsequently,
   the fused multi-level feature vectors and their corresponding trend
   labels are input into a Deep Belief Network (DBN) model to capture
   process dynamics and classify trend changes. Finally, the experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively predict

Title = {Offshore aquaculture as climate change adaptation in coastal areas: sea
   surface temperature trends in the Western Mediterranean Sea},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {515-526},
Abstract = {The warming of the Mediterranean Sea surface is currently estimated to
   have been 0.4 degrees C per decade for the period 1985-2006, and the
   increase in water temperature may have negatively affected marine
   aquaculture, e.g. by decreasing productivity. Development of aquaculture
   without adequate planning can lead to unsustainable economic feasibility
   due to future climate stressors. In this sense, offshore mariculture
   could be an alternative for mitigating the effect of coastal warming.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the
   coastline in terms of global warming and sea surface temperature trends
   in locations where fish aquaculture is currently being developed, as
   well as the spatial changes of thermal anomalies up to 30 km from the
   coast, during the last 31 yr in the western Mediterranean (Spanish
   coast). This study was conducted using EU Copernicus Marine Service
   Information, covering the period 1981-2018, with a spatial resolution of
   4 x 4 km. The results show that, over the last decade, the Mediterranean
   coastal environment off the Iberian Peninsula has experienced an
   increase in temperature of around 1 degrees C due to global change, with
   a clear latitudinal pattern modified by mesoscale oceanographic
   processes. The development of offshore aquaculture at some latitudes
   mitigates the extreme aestival effects on surface water temperatures.
   Strategic plans for aquaculture development should be able to forecast
   and incorporate future climate projections and local oceanographic
   conditions, and offshore aquaculture may provide an alternative in some
   regions, depending on local oceanographic conditions.},

Abstract = {Model output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5
   (CMIP5) archive was compared with the observed latitudinal distribution
   of surface temperature trends between the years 1965 and 2004. By
   comparing model simulations that only consider changes in greenhouse gas
   forcing (GHG) with simulations that also consider the time evolution of
   anthropogenic aerosol emissions (GHGAERO), the influence of aerosol
   forcing on modeled surface temperature trends, and the dependence of the
   forcing on the model representation of aerosols and aerosol indirect
   effects, was evaluated. One group of models include sophisticated
   parameterizations of aerosol activation into cloud droplets; viz., the
   cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) is a function of the modeled
   supersaturation as well as the aerosol concentration. In these models,
   the temperature trend bias was reduced in GHGAERO compared to GHG in
   more regions than in the other models. The ratio between high- and
   low-latitude warming also improved compared to observations. In a second
   group of models, the CDNC is diagnosed using an empirical relationship
   between the CDNC and the aerosol concentration. In this group, the
   temperature trend bias was reduced in more regions than in the model
   group where no aerosol indirect effects are considered. No clear
   difference could be found between models that include an explicit
   aerosol module and the ones that utilize prescribed aerosol. There was
   also no clear difference between models that include aerosol effects on
   the precipitation formation rate and the ones that do not. The results
   indicate that the best representation of recent observed surface
   temperature trends is obtained if the modeled CDNC is a function of both
   the aerosol concentration and the supersaturation.},

   relationship to total cloud cover and sunshine duration},
Journal = {ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {795-804},
Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the effect of total cloud cover (TCC) and
   sunshine duration (SSD) in the variation of diurnal temperature range
   (DTR) in China during 1954-2009. As expected, the inter-annual variation
   of DTR was mainly determined by TCC. Analysis of trends of 30-year
   moving windows of DTR and TCC time series showed that TCC changes could
   account for that of DTR in some cases. However, TCC decreased during
   1954-2009, which did not support DTR reduction across China. DTRs under
   sky conditions such as clear, cloudy and overcast showed nearly the same
   decreasing rate that completely accounted for the overall DTR reduction.
   Nevertheless, correlation between SSD and DTR was weak and not
   significant under clear sky conditions in which aerosol direct radiative
   effect should be dominant. Furthermore, 30-60\% of DTR reduction was
   associated with DTR decrease under overcast conditions in south China.
   This implies that aerosol direct radiative effect appears not to be one
   of the main factors determining long-term changes in DTR in China.},

Title = {21st century trends in Antarctic temperature and polar stratospheric
   cloud (PSC) area in the GEOS chemistry-climate model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {This study examines trends in Antarctic temperature and A(PSC), a
   temperature proxy for the area of polar stratospheric clouds, in an
   ensemble of Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) chemistry-climate
   model (CCM) simulations of the 21st century. A selection of greenhouse
   gas, ozone-depleting substance, and sea surface temperature scenarios is
   used to test the trend sensitivity to these parameters. One scenario is
   used to compare temperature trends in two versions of the GEOS CCM. An
   extended austral winter season is examined in detail. In May, June, and
   July, the expected future increase in CO2-related radiative cooling
   drives temperature trends in the Antarctic lower stratosphere. At 50
   hPa, a 1-3 K cooling is expected between 2000 and 2100. Ozone levels
   increase, despite this robust cooling signal and the consequent increase
   in A(PSC), suggesting the enhancement of stratospheric transport in
   future. In the lower stratosphere, the choice of climate change
   scenarios does not affect the magnitude of the early winter cooling.
   Midwinter temperature trends are generally small. In October, A(PSC)
   trends have the same sign as the prescribed halogen trends. That is,
   there are negative A(PSC) trends in ``realistic future{''} simulations,
   where halogen loading decreases in accordance with the Montreal Protocol
   and CO2 continues to increase. In these simulations, the speed of ozone
   recovery is not influenced by either the choice of sea surface
   temperature and greenhouse gas scenarios or by the model version.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 12},
Abstract = {In this study, an analysis of hourly air temperatures in four groups of
   32 stations from the UK highland (5 stations), UK lowland (4 stations),
   Italian highland (11 stations), and Italian lowland (12 stations) at
   different altitudes was carried out over the period from 2002 to 2021.
   The study aimed to examine the trends of each hour of the day during
   this period, over different averaging time windows (10-day, 30-day, and
   60-day). The trends were computed using the Mann-Kendall trend test and
   Sen's slope estimator. The similarity of trends within and across the
   groups of stations was assessed using the hierarchical clustering with
   dynamic time warping technique. An additional analysis was conducted to
   show the correlation of trends among the group of stations using the
   correlation distance matrix. Hierarchical clustering and distance
   correlation analysis show trend similarities and correlations, also
   indicating dissimilarities among different groups. Using 30-day
   averages, significant warming trends in specific months at the Italian
   stations are evident, especially in February, July, August, and
   December. The UK highland stations did not show statistically
   significant trends, but clear pattern similarities were found within the
   groups, especially in certain months. The ultimate goal of this article
   is to provide insights into temperature dynamics and climate change
   characteristics on regional and diurnal scales.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the Mann-Kendall
   (MK) trend test, and the sequential Mann-Kendall test are applied to
   temperature series at different time scales in order to detect the
   long-term trends (1956-2010) in synoptic-scale surface temperatures in
   Iran, as well as the dominant time scales affecting these temperature
   time series. The relevant data was extracted from a gridded data file of
   the region (44 degrees E to 63.5 degrees E, 25 degrees N to 40 degrees
   N) and divided into 12 regular zones (of dimensions 5 x 5 degrees), each
   of which was analyzed as an individual unit. The results of this
   research show that at the monthly, seasonal and annual time scales, the
   trends in temperature were significant and positive in all of the study
   zones. In addition, the 2-month and 4-month components were dominant at
   the monthly time scale, the 48-month component dominant at the seasonal
   time scale, and the 8-year and 16-year components dominant at the annual
   time scale. Also, the temperature trends in the northern, and especially
   central, regions of the study zones increased from west to east, and
   these increasing trends in temperature were most prominent for the
   spring and summer seasons. The methodology applied here is generally
   applicable and quite useful for studying both trends and the dominant
   time scales affecting climatic data series and could find significant
   applications in related fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Multi-decadal variability and trends in the temperature of the northwest
   European continental shelf: A model-data synthesis},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {96-117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We examine the trends and variability in temperature of the northwest
   European shelf seas over the period 1960-2004 using four approaches: a
   regional model simulation (using the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory
   Coastal Ocean Modelling System; POLCOMS), in situ multi-annual
   timeseries observations, satellite remote sensed (AVHRR) sea surface
   temperature (SST), and an analysis of data held in an international
   database at the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea
   (ICES). We focus on variability for the full period and trends from 1985
   to 2004, being limited by the length of model simulation and the
   availability of satellite data. We find that all data sources give a
   consistent picture, with both trends and variability being intensified
   on-shelf and north of similar to 48 degrees N. The model and AVHRR SST
   show statistically significant warming trends in large areas of this
   region that are clearly distinguishable from both model/observation
   error and natural variability on these timescales. This `signal to noise
   ratio' is substantially reduced when near bottom temperatures are
   considered in the model. The long timeseries at Port Erin (Isle of Man)
   shows that the variation in trend is well represented by the model and
   that the warming trend in the period 1985-2004 is substantially larger
   and of longer duration than previous peaks in 20-year trends since 1914.
   We find that the SST trends are greater in the model and satellite
   observations than the air temperature trends in the ERA40 re-analysis
   used for forcing; the net sea to air heat flux is similar to 20\% less
   in 1985-2004 than 1960-1984 (including shortwave, longwave, sensible and
   latent components). This is partly compensated by a similar to 9\%
   reduction in advective warming. The model shows the trends in seasonally
   stratified regions are greater at the surface than at depth, indicating
   an increase in this stratification. While this pattern is also seen in
   the annual trends from the ICES data analysis, the lack of seasonal
   resolution hampers a quantitative corroboration.
   The model is seen to have good skill in reproducing both the trends and
   variability, but tends to underestimate the trends. The modelled
   variability is overestimated in some coastal and open ocean regions and
   underestimated elsewhere, while the phase of this variability is
   generally well represented. Generally the model performance is better
   on-shelf than in the open ocean. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Title = {Assessing Solar Irradiance Trends and Temperature Extremes by Applying
   Machine Learning Based Statistical Modelling for Renewable Energy
   Optimization},
Journal = {EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 10},
Abstract = {In the pursuit of sustainable development goals, understanding the
   temporal trends and variability of solar irradiance (SI) is crucial,
   especially for the promotion of clean energy production and
   environmental pollution management. The topic has received scant
   attention in research literature, with no attention given to arid
   regions. This study investigated the variabilities and trends of SI and
   the influence of maximum temperature (T-max) events by applying machine
   learning (ML) based statistical modelling in Kuwait during 1984-2022.
   Monthly variabilities were identified by calculating descriptive
   statistics. ML based linear trend models including Mann-Kendall test
   (MKT), and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) were used for daily, monthly,
   and annual trend analyses. Density plots and Pearson's correlation
   coefficients (r) were used to assess linear associations and dominance
   range. Time-frequency relationships and associations were assessed using
   wavelet coherence transform (WCT) analysis. Outcomes revealed that
   Kuwaiti cities experienced peak SI in June and July (>= 7.0
   kW.hr/m(2)/day), suggesting a high solar energy production period. All
   three trend models exhibited consistent outcomes, with increasing SI
   trends in all cities except in Mina Suud. The values of r suggest a
   strong positive influence of T-max on rising trends of SI in all cities,
   with a pronounced influence between the 42(o)C and 47(o)C Tmax ranges.
   The in-phase arrow directions in WCT maps suggest a positive association
   between T-max and SI, with a strong power spectrum at a 200 similar to
   700 time-frequency scale and a 95\% confidence level. The insights from
   this study will be instrumental in policymaking for sustainable
   environmental management by achieving SDG 7-Affordable and Clean Energy.},

Abstract = {Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version
   2 (MERRA-2) data for a period of 40 years (1980-2019) was used to detect
   the trend characteristics of daily average temperature in the state of
   Kerala, India. Data extracted from a total of fifty locations in the
   state were statistically processed using Mann-Kendall (MK) and
   Spearman's Rho (SR) tests to detect the trend, Pettitt test to identify
   the single change point, and Theil-Sen's method for the calculation of
   the rate of change. The MERRA-2 product is validated for the study
   region according to statistical indicators. The daily average
   temperature in the state during the period of study varies between 16.56
   and 32.64 degrees C. The spatial pattern of daily average maximum
   temperature shows higher temperature domains in the central and southern
   parts of the state. Trend characteristics of daily average temperature
   assessed through MK and SR tests show a significant increasing trend in
   all stations, with maximum values in stations located in the northern
   part of the state. Change point detected through the Pettitt test
   divided the sampling stations into three groups based on the change in
   daily average temperature characteristics in the years 2002 (north
   zone), 2009 (south zone), and 2012 (central zone), indicating nonunique
   spatial variability in temperature characteristics in the state. The
   rate of change in the daily average temperature assessed indicates an
   increase at the rate of an average of 0.013 degrees C.year(-1). During
   the whole study period, the daily average temperature showed an overall
   increase of 0.54 degrees C, and for the 100-year futuristic prediction,
   the daily average temperature in the state shows an average increase of
   1.35 degrees C. Among the stations, a higher rate of increase in daily
   average temperature is shown by stations located in the eastern part of
   the Pathanamthitta, Idukki, and Kollam districts. Though the rise in
   daily average temperature is not much higher, its spatial
   characteristics require more attention because, in recent times, the
   study area has faced repeated, severe, and long drought conditions along
   with sunburn incidents. As an agrarian state, a change in the
   temperature domain will adversely affect the overall agricultural
   production and will evoke not only a food crisis but also economic as
   well as water resources issues. The result obtained can be used as
   holistic basic information for understanding the impending effect of
   climate change in the state to frame better mitigation as well as
   management strategies.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic-aerosol (AA) radiative forcing modulates multidecadal
   greenhouse radiative forcing. However, decadal climate responses to AA
   are poorly characterized given AA forcing uncertainty and internal
   climate variability. This motivates revisiting a recent claim that AA
   drove a negative trend in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and an
   associated cooling influence in the 10-15years following the late-1990's
   El Nino. The average of a 50-member initial condition ensemble of the
   second generation Canadian Earth System Model version 2 that was forced
   only with AA does not exhibit the negative-Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation/slowdown response. However, spurious responses of this kind,
   that are artifacts of subsetting the large ensemble (LE) in a manner
   consistent with published literature, can readily be found. This
   illustrates the caution needed in interpreting regional- and
   decadal-scale responses to AA and suggests that improved
   characterization of model uncertainty in AA over the recent period is
   required.
   Plain Language Summary Pollution associated with the emission of
   aerosols from industry and transportation have been considered to be
   important to explain the long-term behavior of global mean temperature
   over the past half century. On shorter timescales of a couple of decades
   or less, recent work has suggested that these so called anthropogenic
   aerosols (AAs) have also limited the amount of global warming that has
   taken place in recent years. The sources and processes associated with
   AA are highly complex and uncertain, and so we here are revisiting a
   recent claim that AA played a detectable role in modulating global
   temperatures in the 10-15 years after the late 1990's El Nino. We use a
   large number of simulations of the Canadian Earth System Model version 2
   that sample the chaotic variability of climate, and this ensemble shows
   that AA does not lead to a strong signal over this period. However, we
   show that if we look at smaller samples of this ensemble, a spurious
   signal can arise that falsely gives the appearance that AA is driving
   large signals. Although the required ensemble is only available for
   version 2 of the Canadian Earth System Model, this result suggests that
   caution is needed in saying that AA has caused recent unexplained trends

Abstract = {Understanding surface air temperature (SAT) changes in China during the
   past 100 years is important; however, this is difficult because the
   impacts of multi-decadal variability (MDV), the urbanization effect, and
   other anthropogenic forcings are combined in instrumental records. The
   present study attempts to disentangle these factors recorded in
   observations in eastern China based on recently homogenized SAT data
   during 1909-2010. The estimated linear trend (secular nonlinear trend)
   in the data after deurbanization is 1.08 (1.74)degrees C (100
   years)(-1). The MDV has enhanced warming in the early 20th century and
   during the past 30 years, contributing approximately 30\% to the latter
   period.},

Abstract = {Based on a temperature anomaly time series from 16 international
   exchange stations in Xinjiang from 1957 to 2012, the multi-scale
   characteristics of temperature variability were analysed using the
   ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. Regional
   differences in variation trends and change-points were also
   preliminarily discussed. The results indicated that in the past 50+
   years, the overall temperature in Xinjiang has exhibited a significant
   nonlinear upward trend, and its changes have clearly exhibited an
   inter-annual scale (quasi-3 and quasi-6-year) and inter-decadal scale
   (quasi-10 and quasi-30-year). The variance contribution rates of each
   component demonstrated that the inter-annual change had a strong
   influence on the overall temperature change in Xinjiang, and the
   reconstructed inter-annual variation trend could describe the
   fluctuation state of the original temperature anomaly during the study
   period. The reconstructed inter-decadal variability revealed that the
   climate mode in Xinjiang had a significant transformation before and
   after 1995, namely the temperature anomaly shift from a negative phase
   to a positive one. Furthermore, there were regional differences in the
   nonlinear changes and change-points of temperature. At the same time,
   the results also suggested that the EEMD method can effectively reveal
   variations in long-term temperature sequences at different time scales
   and can be used for the complex diagnosis of nonlinear and
   non-stationary signal changes.},

Abstract = {Stringent emission policy has put automotive research \& development on
   developing high efficiency and low pollutant power train. Conventional
   direct injection diesel engine with diffused flame has reached its
   limitation and has driven R\&D to explore other field of combustion. Low
   temperature combustion (LTC) and homogeneous charge combustion ignition
   has been proven to be effective methods in decreasing combustion
   pollutant emission. Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) and Particulate Matter (PM)
   formation from combustion can be greatly suppressed. A review on each of
   method is covered to identify the condition and processes that result in
   these reductions. The critical parameters that allow such combustion to
   take place will be highlighted and serves as emphasis to the direction
   of developing future diesel engine system. This paper is written to
   explore potential of present numerical and experimental methods in
   optimizing diesel engine design through adoption of the new combustion
   technology.},

Abstract = {The climate change phenomenon has become more imminent in the present
   century than ever before, as indicated by the unabated rise in
   atmospheric temperature aberrations from local to regional scales. Our
   study focuses on the changes in mean air temperature (Tavg) in the parts
   of eastern Himalaya, representing Naga, Lusai and Khashi hills, extended
   over the regional boundaries of seven northeast Indian states. We
   observed statistically significant increase in annual Tavg, for the
   majority of ground meteorological stations in northeast India. Monthly
   values depict significant increase for Basar, Imphal and Gangtok in the
   majority of the months, followed by Umiam, Kolasib and Kailashahar.
   Despite the spatial variability, the overall range of increase in Tavg
   is 0.2 A degrees C to 1.6 A degrees C per decade across the study
   region. Significant rise in Tavg during the winter is experienced by
   five out of seven places. Change-point detection analysis revealed that
   Tavg values of Imphal experienced maximum number of shifts during the
   early to late 1990s, followed by Gangtok, Basar, Umiam and Kolasib.
   Shifts in Tavg during winter months are also most common and occurred
   during the late-1990s. The results may be used in modelling the impact
   of changing climate on the ecosystem and agriculture of north-east
   India.},

Title = {Trend analysis of reference evapotranspiration in Northwest China: The

Abstract = {Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is an important element in the water
   cycle that integrates atmospheric demands and surface conditions, and
   analysis of changes in ET0 is of great significance for understanding
   climate change and its impacts on hydrology. As ET0 is an integrated
   effect of climate variables, increases in air temperature should lead to
   increases in ET0. However, this effect could be offset by decreases in
   vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, and solar radiation which lead to
   the decrease in ET0. In this study, trends in the Penman-Monteith ET0 at
   80 meteorological stations during 1960-2010 in the driest region of
   China (Northwest China) were examined. The results show that there was a
   change point for ET0 series around the year 1993 based on the Pettitt's
   test. For the region average, ET0 decreased from 1960 to 1993 by
   -2.34mmyr(-2), while ET0 began to increase since 1994 by 4.80mmyr(-2). A
   differential equation method based on the Food and Agriculture
   Organization Penman-Monteith formula was used to attribute the change in
   ET0. The attribution results show that the significant decrease in wind
   speed dominated the change in ET0, which offset the effect of increasing
   air temperature and led to the decrease in ET0 from 1960 to 1993.
   However, wind speed began to increase, and the amplitude of increase in
   air temperature also rose significantly since the mid-1990s. Increases
   in air temperature and wind speed together reversed the trend in ET0 and
   led to the increase in ET0 since 1994. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {With global warming and frequent occurrence of extreme hot events, the
   accompanying heat stress, which is believed to be the combined effects
   of temperature and humidity on human health, is also expected to
   increase. The temperature and precipitation both increased recently,
   which indicates a high incidence of extreme compound hot and humid
   events (CHHEs) in South China, while its trend and mechanism still need
   further research. Through the comparison of three types of extreme
   events (extreme hot events (HOEs), extreme humid events (HUEs), and
   extreme compound hot and humid events (CHHEs)), this study revealed the
   spatiotemporal characteristics, driving factors, and
   temperature-humidity relationships of CHHEs in South China. What's more,
   the temperature-humidity relationships of CHHEs with different dominant
   types and intensities were further explored. The research results are as
   follows: (1) HOEs and CHHEs significantly increased, while HUEs
   decreased, which is consistent with the trend of temperature and
   relative humidity. (2) The driving factors of HOEs were opposite to
   those of HUEs, and strong net thermal radiation, evaporation, and water
   vapor transport were favorable meteorological conditions for CHHEs in
   South China. (3) Most of CHHEs in South China were temperature dominant
   type, which covered longer duration and higher intensity than humidity
   dominant and non-dominant types. (4) There was a strong linear
   relationship between temperature and humidity during CHHEs. And for the
   same temperature range, the higher the intensity of CHHEs was, the lower
   the humidity difference would be.},

Title = {Applications of the scanning test of trend changes in regression
   coefficients to monthly temperature over China and Globe},
Journal = {AIMS GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-61},
Abstract = {The algorithm of the scanning t -test of regression slope -coefficients
   in two phases is introduced to detect trend change -points, along with a
   coherency analysis of changes between two time series. This new
   algorithm is different from the previously published scanning Fmax test
   of trend changes. Meanwhile, the fuzzy weighted moving average (FWMA)
   was employed to intuitively verify the results of segment regressions.
   Then, these algorithms were applied to two series of monthly temperature
   over mainland China and the globe for January 1901-December 2020. The
   applied results show that significant changes in segment trends may be
   classified into two gradations on interdecadal and intradecadal scales.
   The coherency of trend changes between the two series were mostly
   positive, with a few differences in the change dates. The global warming
   ``hiatus{''} was detected as two processes on the intradecadel scale: a
   sharp droop -down from July 1998 to February 2000 following a short
   warming up; the second weaker droop -down happened from November 2003 to
   July 2009. Thus, it was featured on the interdecadel scale as the
   warming rate slowed down to be nearly stable from October 2002 to June
   2009 in globally but without turning into cooling. Mainland China seemed
   to slow down weaker, but lasted longer than the globe. A somewhat
   unexpected finding is that the warming rate over Mainland China was
   lower than that for the globe in the case of standardized differences.
   This contradicts the previous conclusion that resulted from annual
   anomalies of temperature. It is suggested that the anomalies in the
   distribution N(0,s) might be referred to the ``perceptual{''} index to
   compare variations in the same series or between two series but with the
   same variance and distribution, while referring to the standardized
   differences in N(0,1) as a ``net{''} indicator to compare fluctuations
   between two series with different variances, even in different
   distributions.},

Title = {Impact of long-term exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and temperature on
   coronavirus disease mortality: observed trends in France},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},

Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began in
   Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic on 11
   March 2020. This study aimed to assess the effects of temperature and
   long-term exposure to air pollution on the COVID-19 mortality rate at
   the sub-national level in France. Methods This cross-sectional study
   considered different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic from May to
   December 2020. It included 96 departments (or NUTS 3) in mainland
   France. Data on long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5), annual
   mean temperature, health services, health risk, and socio-spatial
   factors were used as covariates in negative binomial regression analysis
   to assess their influence on the COVID-19 mortality rate. All data were
   obtained from open-access sources. Results The cumulative COVID-19
   mortality rate by department increased during the study period in
   metropolitan France-from 19.8/100,000 inhabitants (standard deviation
   (SD): 20.1) on 1 May 2020, to 65.4/100,000 inhabitants (SD: 39.4) on 31
   December 2020. The rate was the highest in the departments where the
   annual average of long-term exposure to PM2.5 was high. The negative
   binomial regression models showed that a 1 mu g/m(3) increase in the
   annual average PM2.5 concentration was associated with a statistically
   significant increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate, corresponding to
   24.4\%, 25.8\%, 26.4\%, 26.7\%, 27.1\%, 25.8\%, and 15.1\% in May, June,
   July, August, September, October, and November, respectively. This
   association was no longer significant on 1 and 31 December 2020. The
   association between temperature and the COVID-19 mortality rate was only
   significant on 1 November, 1 December, and 31 December 2020. An increase
   of 1 degrees C in the average temperature was associated with a decrease
   in the COVID-19-mortality rate, corresponding to 9.7\%, 13.3\%, and
   14.5\% on 1 November, 1 December, and 31 December 2020, respectively.
   Conclusion This study found significant associations between the
   COVID-19 mortality rate and long-term exposure to air pollution and
   temperature. However, these associations tended to decrease with the
   persistence of the pandemic and massive spread of the disease across the
   entire country.},

Abstract = {The change and periodicity of Korean winter temperature in the period
   1979-2018 are investigated. It is shown that the winter temperature is
   on a long-term rise, with two regime shifts of winter temperature during
   40 years. In addition, the decrease in cold days is confirmed along with
   the rise in temperature. Analysis of the periodicity of daily
   temperature in winter is carried out by means of power spectral
   analysis. Of the spectral peaks that are statistically significant, the
   most frequent detection exists on the time scale between 7 and 8 days.
   It is found that the number of significant periods have decreased since
   2014, particularly no longer existent around the period of 7 day. The
   longer periods than 7 days gradually increase during 40 years, while the
   shorter periods show the tendency of decrease but recently rebound.
   Spectral analysis calculated from high/low-pass filtered daily
   temperature data also shows similar results.},

Abstract = {The present paper studies the variability and trends of Tropical Nights
   (>20 degrees C) (TNs) on the Iberian Peninsula (IP) over the 1961-2007
   period during the extended summer (defined as June, July, August, and
   September, JJAS). The analyses were performed with the mean series
   calculated for the whole IP and for different subregions. We conducted a
   regionalisation by means of a S-Mode Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
   which identified three subregions where the variability of TNs behaves
   similarly: the Mediterranean (M) region, the centre-north of the
   Peninsula (CN) region, and the Atlantic (A) region. Throughout the
   entire period, the mean summer TN series for the whole IP shows a
   significant increase; there are, however, some regional differences, as
   the CN and M regions present higher rates of warming than the A region.
   Using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) we detected the large-scale
   atmospheric circulation patterns controlling the interannual variability
   of TNs over the IP. The occurrence of TNs in the M and CN subregions is
   highly dependent on anticyclonic conditions over Western Europe in the
   mid-troposphere level. The increase in the positive phase of this
   canonical mode during the last three decades might explain part of the
   positive trend of the TNs detected in summer on the IP. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {In central Greenland, near-surface air temperatures can be estimated
   from long-term. satellite passive microwave brightness temperatures
   supported by limited air-temperature data from automatic weather
   stations. In this region, brightness temperature depends on snow
   emissivity, which varies slowly over time, and on snow temperature,
   which varies more rapidly and is controlled by air temperature. The air
   temperature and brightness temperature data define an emissivity trend
   which can be modeled as an annual sinusoid. An air temperature trend can
   then be derived from the brightness temperature and modeled emissivity
   information. The estimated air temperature values represent an
   integrated near-surface value that defines the overall temperature trend
   at the Greenland Summit. The modeled emissivity cycle allows
   daily-average air temperatures to be estimated across significant gaps
   in weather station records, as well as quality control of their
   temperature data. The technique also generates annual trends of
   emissivity which can be used to evaluate radiative transfer models of
   microwave emissivity from dry firn.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, global warming has been an indisputable fact. The
   increase in extreme events accompanied by the rise in temperature has
   huge influences on many aspects of the society and economy globally. As
   a result, forecasting how global temperatures will change and evolve in
   the future is crucial, but it is restricted by the accuracy and
   uncertainty of model simulations. Based on ensemble empirical mode
   decomposition (EEMD) method, this study first evaluates the performance
   of the CMIP6 models in simulating different timescale components
   including high-frequency components (HFC), low-frequency components
   (LFC), and secular trend (ST) of surface air temperature (SAT). The
   results show that the performance of the CMIP6 models in simulating the
   ST is better. Following the observation constraint method's correction
   of CMIP6 model simulations, we investigate the evolution characteristics
   of future temperature secular trends under different Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. The results show that under
   SSP245 scenario, the rise of SAT first appeared in northwest and east
   North America and eastern Europe. The spatial distribution of evolution
   characteristic under the SSP585 scenario is similar to that of the
   SSP245 scenario but with a larger magnitude. However, more pronounced
   differences appear in warming rate, which shows a downward trend over
   time under the SSP245 scenario and an upward trend with time under the
   SSP585 scenario.},

Abstract = {Attributing the surface air temperature (SAT) trends at regional scale
   to internally generated and externally forced components is a major
   challenge. Based on the observations and ensemble simulations of climate
   models, we apply a ``dynamical adjustment{''} methodology to estimate
   quantitatively the contribution of the internal and forced dynamic and
   thermodynamic components to the East Asian winter SAT trends during
   1979-2018. The observed winter SAT trends are strongly influenced by
   internal variability, especially in the northern East Asia (NEA). The
   internal component of observed SAT trends is largely dynamically
   induced, whereas the forced component is controlled by thermodynamics.
   The internally generated variability offsets the forced warming by more
   than 70\% in the NEA, leading to a weak observed warming in the NEA. In
   contrast, internal contributions are small in the southern East Asia.
   The internally generated SAT changes in the NEA are closely tied to the
   multidecadal changes of Arctic Oscillation.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {10},
Pages = {5034-5044},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {The evolution of near-surface air temperature is influenced by various
   dynamical, radiative, and surface-atmosphere exchange processes whose
   contributions are still not completely quantified. Applying stepwise
   multiple linear regression to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   phase 5 (CMIP5) model simulations and focusing on radiation (diagnosed
   by incoming shortwave and incoming longwave radiation) and land surface
   conditions (diagnosed by soil moisture and albedo) about 79\% of the
   interannual variability and 99\% of the multidecadal trend of monthly
   mean daily maximum temperature over land can be explained. The linear
   model captures well the temperature variability in middle-to-high
   latitudes and in regions close to the equator, whereas its explanatory
   potential is limited in deserts. While radiation is an essential
   explanatory variable over almost all of the analyzed domain, land
   surface conditions show a pronounced relation to temperature in some
   confined regions. These findings highlight that considering
   local-to-regional processes is crucial for correctly assessing
   interannual temperature variability and future temperature trends.},

Title = {Long-Term Trend in Potential Vorticity Intrusion Events over the Pacific
   Ocean: Role of Global Mean Temperature Rise},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {906-915},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this study, we examine a long-term increasing trend in subtropical
   potential vorticity (PV) intrusion events over the Pacific Ocean in
   relation to the global mean temperature rise, based on multiple
   reanalysis datasets. The frequency of the PV intrusions is closely
   related to the upper-tropospheric equatorial westerly duct and the
   subtropical jet (STJ). An overall strengthening of the westerly duct and
   weakening of the STJ are found to be driven by the warming-induced
   strengthening of Walker circulation and regional changes in Hadley
   circulation on multi-decadal timescale, leading to an increase in the PV
   intrusion frequency over the tropics. The results are robust in all
   datasets. The multi-decadal strengthening in the Pacific Walker
   circulation is consistent with the global mean temperature rise. In this
   way, the PV intrusions are correlated with the warming related global
   mean temperuate rise. When the interannual variability of ENSO is
   removed from the intrusion time series, the long-term trend in PV
   intrusions due to external forcing associated with anthropogenic warming
   (global mean temperature rise) becomes clearer. The link between the
   global mean temperature rise and intrusion frequency is further verified
   by performing a correlation analysis between the two. The significant (>
   95\%) correlation coefficient is 0.85, 0.94, 0.84, 0.83, and 0.84 for
   ERA-40, ERA-Interim, NCEP-NCAR, JRA-55, and JRA-25, respectively. This
   unequivocally indicates that the global mean temperature rise can
   explain around 69\%-88\% of the variance related to the long-term
   increase in PV intrusion frequency over the Pacific Ocean.},

Abstract = {A 125-yr ice core record of climate from the Whitehall Glacier ice
   divide provides exceptionally high-resolution stable isotope data from
   the northwest margin of the Ross Sea, Antarctica. This is the only proxy
   data available to extend the instrumental record of temperature in this
   region, where little is known about climate variability over the past
   two centuries. Using ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data, this
   study develops a precipitation-weighted delta O-18-temperature transfer
   function of 0.62 parts per thousand degrees C-1, which is comparable to
   other proximal ice cores, such as Taylor, Talos, and Law Domes.
   Reconstructed mean annual temperatures show no significant change
   between 1882 and 2006. However, a decrease in cold season
   {[}April-September (AMJJAS)] temperatures of -1.59 degrees +/- 0.84
   degrees C decade(-1) (at 90\% confidence) is observed since 1979. This
   cooling trend is in contrast to a surface temperature record from Ross
   Island (Scott Base) where significant spring warming is observed. It is
   also coincident with a positive trend in the southern annular mode,
   which is linked to stronger southerly winds and increased sea ice extent
   and duration in the western Ross Sea.},

Abstract = {The west side of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) has shown great
   variability since the middle of the last century characterized by
   warming mainly because of the oceanic and atmospheric effects such as
   the disintegration of floating ice and the strength of westerly winds.
   Here, we used two climatic databases (reanalysis from 1979 to 2020 and
   surface stations from 1947 to 2020) to investigate trends in extreme air
   temperatures and wind components in the oceanic region between 55
   degrees S and 70 degrees S in the west (75 degrees W) and in the east
   sector (45 degrees W) and over the AP (60 degrees W). Non-parametric
   statistical trend tests and extreme value approaches are used. A set of
   annual, monthly, and seasonal series are fitted. The extremal index is
   applied to measure the degree of independence of monthly excesses over a
   threshold considered extreme events. Increasing trends are verified in
   the annual and monthly temperature and wind series. The greatest trends
   are observed for seasonal series from reanalysis without change-point in
   summer and winter. Decreasing trends are observed for maximum
   temperature in summer and positive trends mainly for the westerly winds
   over the AP. But in winter, the maximum temperature shows an increasing
   trend also over the AP. Most of reanalysis seasonal minimum temperature
   and wind components as well as maximum and minimum temperatures from
   stations present increasing trends with change-point but tend to
   stability after the breakpoints. The generalized distribution (GEV) is
   used to fit temperatures and westerly wind between South America (SA)
   and north of the AP. The 100-year return levels exceed the maximum value
   of the maximum temperature in Esperanza and maximum westerly winds at
   several grid points. Pareto and Poison distributions are applied for the
   maximum temperatures from stations and the 100-year return levels are
   not exceeded. Our findings show significant positive trends for monthly
   wind components near the SA in the region of the westerly winds whose
   changes in position influence directly the SAM, which modifies the
   atmospheric patterns in the South Hemisphere (SH). A predominance of
   seasonal warming is identified, which may impact the climate with
   consequences not only locally but also in other regions.},

   September 2002 to August 2010. The ground-based observations include 72
   Surface Meteorological Stations (SMSs), 6 radiosonde stations (RAOBs),
   457 Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) over the land, and 5 buoy stations
   over the ocean. A strong warming (0.052 K yr(-1)) at the surface, and a
   weak warming (0.004 similar to 0.010 K yr(-1)) in the mid-troposphere
   and low stratosphere have been found from satellite data, leading to an
   unstable atmospheric layer. The AIRS/AMSU warming trend over the ocean
   surface around the Korean Peninsula is about 2.5 times greater than that
   over the land surface. The ground measurements from both SMS and AWS
   over the land surface of South Korea also show a warming of 0.043
   similar to 0.082 K yr(-1), consistent with the satellite observations.
   The correlation average (r = 0.80) between MODIS skin temperature and
   ground measurement is significant. The correlations between AMSU and
   RAOB are very high (0.91 similar to 0.95) in the anomaly time series,
   calculated from the spatial averages of monthly mean temperature values.
   However, the warming found in the AMSU data is stronger than that from
   the RAOB at the surface. The opposite feature is present above the
   mid-troposphere, indicating that there is a systematic difference.
   Warming phenomena (0.012 similar to 0.078 K yr(-1)) are observed from
   all three data sets (SMS, AWS, MODIS), which have been corroborated by
   the coincident measurements at five ground stations. However, it should
   also be noted that the observed trends are subject to large uncertainty
   as the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals tend to be larger than
   the observed signals due to large thermal variability and the relatively
   short periods of the satellite-based temperature records. The EOF
   analysis of monthly mean temperature anomalies indicates that the
   tropospheric temperature variability near Korea is primarily linked to
   the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and secondarily to ENSO (El Nino and
   Southern Oscillation). However, the low stratospheric temperature
   variability is mainly associated with Southern Oscillation and then
   additionally with Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). Uncertainties from
   the different spatial resolutions between satellite data are discussed
   in the trends.},

Abstract = {TIROS-N satellite Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) channel 2 data from
   different view angles across the MSU scan swath are combined to remove
   the influence of the lower stratosphere and much of the upper
   troposphere on the measured brightness temperatures. The retrieval
   provides a sharper averaging kernel than the raw channel 2 weighting
   function. with a peak lowered from 50 kPa to 70 kPa and with only
   slightly more surface influence than raw channel 2. Monthly 2.5-degrees
   gridpoint anomalies of this tropospheric retrieval compared between
   simultaneously operating satellites indicate close agreement,
   0.15-degrees-C in the tropics to around 0.30-degrees-C over much of the
   higher latitudes. The agreement is not as close as with raw channel 2
   anomalies because synoptic-scale temperature gradient information across
   the 2000-km swath of the MSU is lost in the retrieval procedure and
   because the retrieval involves the magnification of a small difference
   between two large numbers. Single gridpoint monthly anomaly correlations
   between the satellite measurements and the radiosonde calculations range
   from around 0.95 at high latitudes to below 0. 8 i n the tropical west
   Pacific, with standard errors of estimate of 0.16-degrees-C at Guam to
   around 0.50-degrees-C at high-latitude continental stations. Calculation
   of radiosonde temperatures with a static weighting function instead of
   the radiative transfer equation degrades the standard errors by an
   average of less than 0.04-degrees-C. Of various standard tropospheric
   layers, the channel 2 retrieval anomalies correlate best with radiosonde
   100-50- or 100-40-kPa-thickness anomalies. A comparison between global
   and hemispheric anomalies computed for raw channel 2 data versus the,
   tropospheric retrieval show a correction in the 1979-90 time series for
   the volcano-induced stratospheric warming of 1982-83, which was
   independently observed by MSU channel 4. This correction leads to a
   slightly greater tropospheric warming trend in the 12-year time series
   (1979-90) for the tropospheric retrieval {[}0.039-degrees-C
   (+/-0.03-degrees-C) per decade] than for channel 2 alone
   {[}0.022-degrees-C (+/-0.02-degrees-C) per decade].},

Journal = {INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Nighttime light (NTL) imagery, as an excellent data source for
   monitoring urban development and human activity, has been used in
   research concerning land surface thermal environment. However, previous
   studies have only taken NTL data as a measure of urbanization degree or
   to obtain intermediate products for LST studies, such as urban
   impervious surface area and building density. Few studies have
   systematically analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of different
   light levels and surface temperatures. In this study, a LST NTL rank
   correlation model was constructed based on MOD11C3 and DMSP/OLS data to
   analyze the characteristics and trends of the relationship between LST
   and NTL, during both daytime and nighttime over China in 2012. The
   findings revealed a strong positive correlation between NTL level and
   1ST, with the peak correlation (R-2 > 0.85) observed during July
   September, which indicated that, with the increase of the light
   intensity, the LST has an overall upward trend. The trend was relatively
   more stable during nighttime (variation range of R-2 was 0.3) than
   during daytime (variation range of R-2 was 0.44). Moreover, it was
   greatly enhanced without considering NTL intensity saturation pixels in
   the NTL partition system, and was further improved after removing pixels
   from urban centers, which was particularly evident at nighttime. This
   provided evidence that NTL intensity can be a good indicator for the
   distribution of urban thermal environment, particularly outside the
   urban centers.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {13},
Pages = {2917-2922},

Abstract = {Phenological data are simple yet sensitive indicators of climate change
   impacts on ecosystems, but observations have not been made routinely or
   extensively enough to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns across most
   continents, including North America. As an alternative, many studies use
   weather-based algorithms to simulate specific phenological responses.
   Spring Indices (SI) are a set of complex phenological models that have
   been successfully applied to evaluate variations and trends in the onset
   of spring across the Northern Hemisphere's temperate regions. To date,
   SI models have been limited by only producing output in locations where
   both the plants' chilling and warmth requirements are met. Here, we
   develop an extended form of the SI (abbreviated SI-x) that expands their
   application into the subtropics by ignoring chilling requirements while
   still retaining the utility and accuracy of the original SI (now
   abbreviated SI-o).The validity of the new indices is tested, and
   regional SI anomalies are explored across the data-rich continental
   United States. SI-x variations from 1900 to 2010 show an abrupt and
   sustained delay in spring onset of about 4-8d (around 1958) in parts of
   the Southeast and southern Great Plains, and a comparable advance of
   4-8d (around 1984) in parts of the northern Great Plains and the West.
   Atmospheric circulation anomalies, linked to large-scale modes of
   variability, exert modest but significant roles in the timing of spring
   onset across the United States on interannual and longer timescales. The
   SI-x are promising metrics for tracking spring onset variations and
   trends in mid-latitudes, relating them to relevant ecological,
   hydrological, and socioeconomic phenomena, and exploring connections
   between atmospheric drivers and seasonal timing.},

Abstract = {Interannual variations in the number of winter extreme warm and cold
   days over eastern China (EC) and their relationship with the Arctic
   Oscillation (AO) and El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were
   investigated using an updated temperature dataset comprising 542 Chinese
   stations during the period 1961-2011. Results showed that the number of
   winter extreme warm (cold) days across EC experienced a significant
   increase (decrease) around the mid-1980s, which could be attributed to
   interdecadal variation of the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM).
   Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of winter temperature extremes
   in different phases of the AO and ENSO were estimated based on
   Generalized Extreme Value Distribution theory. Correlation analysis and
   the PDF technique consistently demonstrated that interannual variation
   of winter extreme cold days in the northern part of EC (NEC) is closely
   linked to the AO, while it is most strongly related to the ENSO in the
   southern part (SEC). However, the number of winter extreme warm days
   across EC has little correlation with both AO and ENSO. Furthermore,
   results indicated that, whether before or after the mid-1980s shift, a
   significant connection existed between winter extreme cold days in NEC
   and the AO. However, a significant connection between winter extreme
   cold days in SEC and the ENSO was only found after the mid-1980s shift.
   These results highlight the different roles of the AO and ENSO in
   influencing winter temperature extremes in different parts of EC and in
   different periods, thus providing important clues for improving
   short-term climate prediction for winter temperature extremes.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the role of internal climate variability on the
   wintertime surface air temperature (SAT) trend over Eurasia during
   1970-2004 based on outputs from the Community Earth System Model Large
   Ensemble Project. The SAT trends vary significantly in both spatial
   pattern and magnitude among ensemble members, indicating the essential
   role of internal climate variability on SAT trends. The leading modes of
   the spread of SAT trends are extracted via inter-member empirical
   orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the SAT trend patterns among 40
   ensemble members. The first EOF mode shows widespread warming over
   northern Eurasia and slight cooling southward of 40 degrees N during its
   positive phase. The second EOF mode displays a zonal dipole, with one
   center located in Europe and the other of the opposite sign over
   Siberia. The Arctic Oscillation and Scandinavian patterns are key
   dynamical factors associated with the two dominant modes, respectively.
   A dynamical adjustment method is further employed to decompose the
   internal climate variability into those related to large-scale
   atmospheric circulation and residuals. The spread of SAT trends among
   ensemble members is primarily associated with the various large-scale
   atmospheric circulation and second by the residual component that is
   closely tied to diverse snow cover trends over Eurasia, especially over
   northern Eurasia. These results may help understand the relationship
   between internal climate variability and winter SAT trends over Eurasia
   via dynamical and thermodynamical processes.},

Title = {Climate Change Impacts on Temperature and Chill Unit Trends for Apple
   (<i>Malus domestica</i>) Production in Ceres, South Africa},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Climate is an essential part of crop production, determining the
   suitability of a given region for deciduous fruit products such as
   apples (Malus domestica). It influences the yield and quality of fruits.
   There is strong evidence of global and regional-scale climate change
   since the advent of the industrial era. In South Africa, mean surface
   temperatures have revealed a warming trend over the last century. This
   study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on temperature and
   chill unit trends for apple production in Ceres, South Africa. The daily
   positive Utah chill units (DPCU) model was used as frequent high
   temperatures can lead to a high negation volume. Historically observed
   (1981-2010) and future projected (2011-2100) temperatures were obtained
   from the South African Weather Service (SAWS) and three ensemble members
   of the Cubic-Conformal Atmospheric Model (CCAM), respectively. The
   latter employed the RCP8.5 pathway. Linear trends were calculated for
   temperature and accumulated PCUs for the historical base period. The
   probability of accumulating specific threshold PCU values for both
   historical and future periods was assessed from cumulative distribution
   functions (CDFs). The historical change in minimum temperatures showed
   no significant trend. Ceres revealed a warming trend in maximum
   temperatures over the historical period. By the 2080s, the probability
   of not exceeding a threshold of 1600 PCUs was exceptionally high for all
   ensemble members. Future projections showed a decline in the accumulated
   PCUs of 2-5\% by the 2020s, 7-17\% by the 2050s, and 20-34\% towards the
   end of the 20th century. Based on these results, it is clear that winter
   chill units are negatively influenced by climate change. The loss in
   yield and fruit quality of apples due to climate change can negatively
   impact the export market, leading to significant economic losses for
   apple production in the Ceres area.},

Title = {Trends, Predictors and Outcomes After Utilization of Targeted
   Temperature Management in Cardiac Arrest Patients With Anoxic Brain
   Injury},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {360},

Pages = {363-371},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) is a class I
   recommendation for the management of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)
   patients with presumed brain injury. We aimed to study trends,
   predictors and outcomes in SCA patients from a nationally represented US
   population sample.
   Methods: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample from years 2005 to
   2014 for the purpose of our study. Patients with SCA and anoxic brain
   injury were selected using relevant ICD-9 codes. Data were analyzed for
   trends over the years and key outcomes were assessed. Logistic
   regression analysis was done to determine predictors of TTM utilization
   in our study population.
   Results: A total of 78,465 patients with SCA and anoxic brain injury
   were identified from January 2005 to December 2014. Out of these,
   approximately 4,481 (5.7\%) patients underwent TTM. Patients that
   underwent TTM were younger compared to patients without TTM utilization
   (60.67 vs. 63.27 years, P < 0.01). African Americans, Hispanics and
   women were less likely to undergo TTM. Myocardial infarction,
   electrolyte disorders and cardiogenic shock were associated with higher
   odds of TTM utilization. Sepsis, renal failure and diabetes were
   associated with underutilization of TTM. Inpatient mortality was higher
   in patients who did not undergo TTM when compared to patients who
   underwent TTM (67.30\% vs. 65.10\%, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Although TTM utilization increased over our study period,
   the overall application of TTM was still dismal. Factors that circumvent
   TTM utilization need to be addressed in future studies so more eligible
   patients could benefit from this life saving therapy.},

Abstract = {A simple model based on the ``big leaf{''} assumption and calibrated
   with field eco-physiological measures of gas exchanges is used to
   simulate the effects of temperature increase on net primary production,
   total canopy transpiration and the dimensionless decoupling coefficient
   Omega of Holm oak forests. Two different annual average air
   temperatures: 14.6 and 18.0degreesC are considered, they are
   respectively the average current temperature and the one expected in the
   next 50 years in the Mediterranean area if the trend of global warming
   will continue. The model simulates the behaviour of the three parameters
   by assuming no changes in the effects of water constraints at both the
   temperatures. The model has been implemented by STELLA((R)) II software.
   According to the model, the increase of air temperature affects both the
   net primary productivity (6.3\%) and the water losses by canopy
   transpiration (37.2\%). The model predicts an average decoupling factor,
   Omega, of about 0.26 at both temperatures of 14.6 and 18.0degreesC. This
   value is in the range between Heathlands and Forest, suggesting that at
   the average annual temperature of 18.0degreesC the Holm oak forest will
   start to respond in a similar way to more xeric plant communities. (C)

Year = {2017},

Abstract = {High transition temperature (T-c) superconductivity in FeSe/SrTiO3 has
   been widely discussed on the possible mechanisms in conjunction with the
   various effects of interface between FeSe and SrTiO3 substrate. By
   employing an electric-double-layer transistor configuration, which
   enables both the electrostatic carrier doping and electrochemical
   thickness tuning, we investigated the interfacial effect on the high-T-c
   phase at around 40 K in FeSe films deposited on SrTiO3, MgO, and KTaO3
   substrates. The systematic study on thickness dependence of transport
   properties under a certain gate voltage reveals the universal trend of
   the onset Tc against the Hall coefficient in all the FeSe films,
   irrespective of the substrate materials in which the different
   contribution of interfacial effect is expected. The independence of the
   highest T-c on substrate materials evidences that the high-T-c
   superconductivity at around 40 K does not primarily originate from a
   specific interface combination but from a charge carrier filling at
   specific electronic band structure.},

Title = {Recent Reversal of the Upper-Tropospheric Temperature Trend and its Role
   in Intensifying the East Asian Summer Monsoon},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {At the beginning of the 21st century, the July and August (JA) mean
   upper-tropospheric temperature over East Asia shows a significant
   increasing trend, contrary to the decreasing trend in the late 1970 s.
   The largest warming center is over northern China (between 30 degrees
   N-45 degrees N and 85 degrees E-120 degrees E) around 300 hPa. Together
   with the temperature rising, the geo-potential height rises above the
   warming center and drops below, which connects closely to a
   correspondingly significant decadal shift of the general circulation
   over East Asia. In the upper-level of the troposphere, an anomalous
   anti-cyclone dominates, and the 200-hPa westerly jet strengthens due to
   the increasing pole-ward geo-potential height gradient. In the
   lower-troposphere, the anomalous southerly wind increases around Yangtze
   River Valley and the East Asian summer monsoon intensifies. The
   integrated circulation changes seriously impact summer precipitation
   over East Asia. The so-called ``southern flood and northern drought{''}
   (SFND) pattern since the 1970 s over eastern China has changed. As the
   cooling center in the 1970 s moves southward, the dry belt moves
   southward as well. A wet belt dominates the Huaihe River Valley after
   the temperature trend reversal at 2005 while southern China experiences
   a dry condition.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the significant effects of both well-known
   contaminants (particles, gases) and less-studied variables (temperature,
   humidity) on serious, if relatively common, respiratory and circulatory
   diseases. The area of study is Lisbon, Portugal, and time series of
   health outcome (daily admissions in 12 hospitals) and environmental data
   (daily averages of air temperature, relative humidity, PM10, SO2, NO,
   NO2, CO, and O-3) have been gathered for 1999-2004 to ascertain (1)
   whether concentrations of air pollutants and levels of temperature and
   humidity do interfere on human health, as gauged by hospital admissions
   due to respiratory and circulatory ailments; and (2) whether there is an
   effect of population age in such admissions. In general terms,
   statistically significant (p < 0.001) correlations were found between
   hospital admissions and temperature, humidity, PM10, and all gaseous
   pollutants except CO and NO. Age appears to influence respiratory
   conditions in association with temperature, whereas, for circulatory
   conditions, such an influence likely involves temperature as well as the
   gaseous pollutants NO2 and SO2.},

Title = {Atmospheric Circulation Trends, 1950-2000: The Relative Roles of Sea
   Surface Temperature Forcing and Direct Atmospheric Radiative Forcing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2009},

Abstract = {The relative roles of direct atmospheric radiative forcing (due to
   observed changes in well-mixed greenhouse gases, tropospheric and
   stratospheric ozone, sulfate and volcanic aerosols, and solar output)
   and observed sea surface temperature (SST) forcing of global
   December-February atmospheric circulation trends during the second half
   of the twentieth century are investigated by means of experiments with
   an atmospheric general circulation model, Community Atmospheric Model,
   version 3 (CAM3). The model experiments are conducted by specifying the
   observed time-varying SSTs and atmospheric radiative quantities
   individually and in combination. This approach allows the authors to
   isolate the direct impact of each type of forcing agent as well as to
   evaluate their combined effect and the degree to which their impacts are
   additive. CAM3 realistically simulates the global patterns of sea level
   pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height trends when both forcings are
   specified. SST forcing and direct atmospheric radiative forcing drive
   distinctive circulation responses that contribute about equally to the
   global pattern of circulation trends. These distinctive circulation
   responses are approximately additive and partially offsetting.
   Atmospheric radiative changes directly drive the strengthening and
   poleward shift of the midlatitude westerly winds in the Southern
   Hemisphere (and to a lesser extent may contribute to those over the
   Atlantic-Eurasian sector in the Northern Hemisphere), whereas SST trends
   (specifically those in the tropics) are responsible for the
   intensification of the Aleutian low and weakening of the tropical Walker
   circulation. Discrepancies between the atmospheric circulation trends
   simulated by CAM3 and Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3),
   a coupled model driven by the same atmospheric radiative forcing as
   CAM3, are traced to differences in their tropical SST trends: in
   particular, a 60\% weaker warming of the tropical Indo-Pacific in the
   CCSM3 ensemble mean than in nature.},

Title = {Is there a trend in extremely high river temperature for the next
   decades? A case study for France},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-79},
Abstract = {After 2003's summer heat wave, Electricite de France created a global
   plan called `heat wave-dryness'. In this context, the present study
   tries to estimate high river temperatures for the next decades, taking
   into account climatic and anthropogenic evolutions. To do it, a specific
   methodology based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is applied. In
   particular, a trend analysis of water temperature data is done and
   included in EVT used. The studied river temperatures consist of mean
   daily temperatures for 27 years measured near the French power plants
   (between 1977 and 2003), with four series for the Rhone river, four for
   the Loire river and a few for other rivers. There are also three series
   of mean daily temperatures computed by a numerical model. For each
   series, we have applied statistical extreme value modelling. Because of
   thermal inertia, the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is
   corrected by the medium cluster length, which represents thermal inertia
   of water during extremely hot events. The mu and alpha parameters of the
   GEV distributions are taken as polynomial or continuous piecewise linear
   functions of time. The best functions for mu and alpha parameters are
   chosen using Akaike criterion based on likelihood and some physical
   checking. For all series, the trend is positive for mu and not
   significant for alpha, over the last 27 years. However, we cannot assign
   this evolution only to the climatic change for the Rhone river because
   the river temperature is the resultant of several causes: hydraulic or
   atmospheric, natural or related to the human activity. For the other
   rivers, the trend for mu could be assigned to the climatic change more
   clearly. Furthermore, the sample is too short to provide reliable return
   levels estimations for return periods exceeding thirty years. Still,
   quantitative return levels could be compared with physical models for
   example.},

Title = {Out of the tropics: Macroevolutionary size trends in an old insect order

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {AimGlobal interspecific body size distributions have been suggested to
   be shaped by selection pressures arising from biotic and abiotic factors
   such as temperature, predation and parasitism. Here, we investigated the
   ecological and evolutionary drivers of global latitudinal size gradients
   in an old insect order.
   LocationGlobal.
   TaxonOdonata (dragonflies and damselflies).
   MethodsWe compiled data on interspecific variation in extant and extinct
   body sizes of Odonata, using an already existing database (The Odonate
   Phenotypic Database) and fossil data (The Paleobiology Database). We
   combined such body size data with latitudinal information and data on
   biotic and abiotic environmental variables across the globe to
   investigate and quantify interspecific latitudinal size-gradients
   ({''}Bergmann's Rule{''}) and their environmental determinants. We used
   phylogenetic comparative methods and a global published phylogeny of
   Odonata to address these questions.
   ResultsPhylogenetic comparative analyses revealed that global size
   variation of extant Odonata taxa is negatively influenced by both
   regional avian diversity and temperature, with larger-bodied species in
   the suborder Anisoptera (dragonflies) showing a steeper size-latitude
   relationship than smaller-bodied species in the suborder Zygoptera
   (damselflies). Interestingly, fossil data show that the relationship
   between wing size and latitude has shifted: latitudinal size trends had
   initially negative slopes but became shallower or positive following the
   evolutionary emergence and radiation of birds.
   Main ConclusionsThe changing size-latitude trends over geological and
   macroevolutionary time were likely driven by a combination of predation
   from birds and maybe pterosaurs and high dispersal ability of large
   dragonflies. Our study reveals that a simple version of Bergmann's Rule
   based on temperature alone is not sufficient to explain interspecific
   size-latitude trends in Odonata. Our results instead suggest that
   latitudinal size gradients were shaped not only by temperature but also
   by avian predators, potentially driving the dispersal of large-sized
   clades out of the tropics and into the temperate zone.},

Title = {Homogenization and trend analysis of 1960-2015 <i>in situ</i> sea
   surface temperature observations along the coast of China},
Journal = {ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},

Pages = {36-46},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) measurements from 26 coastal hydrological
   stations of China during 1960-2015 were homogenized and analyzed in this
   study. The homogenous surface air temperature (SAT) series from
   meteorological stations which were highly correlated to SST series was
   used to construct the reference series. Monthly mean SST series were
   then derived and subjected to a statistical homogeneity test, called
   penalized maximal t test. Homogenized monthly mean SST series were
   obtained by adjusting all significant change points which were supported
   by historic metadata information. Results show that the majority of
   break points are caused by instrument change and station relocation,
   which accounts for about 61.3\% and 24.2\% of the total break points,
   respectively. The regionally averaged annual homogeneous SST series from
   the 26 stations shows a warming trend (0.19 degrees C per decade). This
   result is consistent with that based on the homogenized annual mean SAT
   at the same region (0.22 degrees C per decade), while the regionally
   averaged mean original SST series from the same stations shows a much
   weaker warming of 0.09 degrees C per decade for 1960-2015. This finding
   suggests that the effects of artificial change points on the result of
   trend analysis are remarkable, and the warming rate from original SST
   observations since 1960 may be underestimated. Thus a high quality
   homogenized observation is crucial for robust detection and assessment
   of regional climate change. Furthermore, the trends of the seasonal mean
   homogenized SST were also analyzed. This work confirmed that there was
   an asymmetric seasonal temperature trends in the Chinese coastal water
   in the past decades, with the largest warming rate occurring in winter.
   At last, the significant warming in winter and its relationships to the
   variability of three large-scale atmospheric modes were investigated.},

Abstract = {Most studies indicated that the values of atmospheric variables have
   changed from their general rates due to pollution or global warming etc.
   Hence, the research indicates the changes of direct solar radiation
   values over a whole century i.e. from 1900 to 2000 depending on
   registered data for four cities, namely (Mosul - Baghdad - Rutba -
   Basra. Moreover, attemptsto correlate the direct solar radiation with
   the temperature values have been recorded over that period. The results
   showed that there is a decreasing pattern of radiation quantities over
   time throughout the study period, where the value of direct radiation
   over the city of Baghdad 5550 w/m(2) was recorded in the year 1900, but
   this ratio decreased clearly to approximately 5400 w/m(2) in the year
   2000, which is perhaps due to the increase of general pollution rates in
   the atmosphere. The results also showed that the city of Rutba recorded
   the highest annual rate of radiation quantities, and Baghdad with Mosul
   recorded the lowest radiation ratios compared to the rest of the cities,
   in addition to that there was a large convergence of radiation ratios
   between them to some extent. The results showed that there is a sharp
   drop in radiation ratios, specifically in the years1980and 1990. As for
   the extent of the relationship for solar radiation with temperature
   levels throughout the study period, it was found that there is an
   inverse relationship between them, and this confirms that the cause of
   high temperatures is not because of increased solar radiation, but it
   may rather due to other reasons such as increased greenhouse gases.},

Abstract = {In the context of climatic temperature studies, more often than not a
   time series is affected by artificial inhomogeneities. To overcome such
   limitation, we propose a new simple methodology in which promising
   results point not only toward the detection of unknown inhomogeneous
   periods but also toward the possibility of reconstructing the uncertain
   portion of the series. It is based on a parsimonious statistical
   downscaling (Multiple Linear Regression) of the large-scale 20CR
   reanalysis data. This method is successfully applied upon two long-range
   temperature series from a couple of centennial observatories (Ebre and
   Fabra, NE of Spain) which do not have nearby suitable temperature series
   to compare with. Results of trend analysis point to a clear signal of
   warming, with a larger rate of increase for the maximum temperature
   (respect to the minimum one), for the more recent decades (respect to
   the whole available period), and for the original series (respect to the
   reconstructed ones).},

Abstract = {As the readers were already informed, the Editorial Board of the journal
   of High Temperature made a decision to prepare reviews of materials
   published in the journal during the last five years (High Temp., 1998,
   no. 4) in order to help the readers to find their bearings in the vast
   flow of scientific information characteristic of our times. We hope that
   such reviews will help Russian scientists to see the progress made in
   our country in proper perspective against the background of the results
   obtained in other countries. This is especially important at present,
   when the publication of translation versions of foreign journals has
   virtually ceased, and trips to major world conferences and symposia are
   hard to make because of their forbidding cost. We believe that such
   reviews win continue to be prepared, and not only by members of the
   Editorial Board; this will help clarify in more detail the views of
   other specialists in every ``narrow{''} field.},

Title = {Wet bulb globe temperature from climate model outputs: a method for
   projecting hourly site-specific values and trends},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 17},
Abstract = {Increasing temperature will impact future outdoor worker safety but
   quantifying this impact to develop local adaptations is challenging. Wet
   bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is the preferred thermal index for
   regulating outdoor activities in occupational health, athletic, and
   military settings, but global circulation models (GCMs) have coarse
   spatiotemporal resolution and do not always provide outputs required to
   project the full diurnal range of WBGT. This article presents a novel
   method to project WBGT at local spatial and hourly temporal resolutions
   without many assumptions inherent in previous research. We calculate
   sub-daily future WBGT from GCM output and then estimate hourly WBGT
   based on a site-specific, historical diurnal cycles. We test this method
   against observations at U.S. Army installations and find results match
   closely. We then project hourly WBGT at these locations from January 1,
   2025, to December 31, 2100, to quantify trends and estimate future
   periods exceeding outdoor activity modification thresholds. We find
   regional patterns affecting WBGT, suggesting accurately projecting WBGT
   demands a localized approach. Results show increased frequency of hours
   at high WBGT and, using U.S. military heat thresholds, we estimate
   impacts to future outdoor labor. By mid-century, some locations are
   projected to average 20 or more days each summer when outdoor labor will
   be significantly impacted. The method's fine spatiotemporal resolution
   enables detailed analysis of WBGT projections, making it useful applied
   at specific locations of interest.},

Title = {Annual and Seasonal Trends of Vegetation Responses and Feedback to
   Temperature on the Tibetan Plateau since the 1980s},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {The vegetation-temperature relationship is crucial in understanding
   land-atmosphere interactions on the Tibetan Plateau. Although many
   studies have investigated the connections between vegetation and climate
   variables in this region using remote sensing technology, there remain
   notable gaps in our understanding of vegetation-temperature interactions
   over different timescales. Here, we combined site-level air temperature
   observations, information from the global inventory modeling and mapping
   studies (GIMMS) dataset, and moderate-resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer (MODIS) products to analyze the spatial and temporal
   patterns of air temperature, vegetation, and land surface temperature
   (LST) on the Tibetan Plateau at annual and seasonal scales. We achieved
   these spatiotemporal patterns by using Sen's slope, sequential
   Mann-Kendall tests, and partial correlation analysis. The timescale
   differences of vegetation-induced LST were subsequently discussed. Our
   results demonstrate that a breakpoint of air temperature change occurred
   on the Tibetan Plateau during 1994-1998, dividing the study period
   (1982-2013) into two phases. A more significant greening response of
   NDVI occurred in the spring and autumn with earlier breakpoints and a
   more sensitive NDVI response occurred in recent warming phase. Both
   MODIS and GIMMS data showed a common increase in the normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the Tibetan Plateau for all
   timescales, while the former had a larger greening area since 2000. The
   most prominent trends in NDVI and LST were identified in spring and
   autumn, respectively, and the largest areas of significant variation in
   NDVI and LST mostly occurred in winter and autumn, respectively. The
   partial correlation analysis revealed a significant negative impact of
   NDVI on LST during the annual scale and autumn, and it had a significant
   positive impact during spring. Our findings improve the general
   understanding of vegetation-climate relationships at annual and seasonal
   scales.},

Title = {Disentangling temperature and water stress contributions to trends in

   2005-2016},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {295},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Isoprene, produced by plants in response to multiple drivers, affects
   climate and air quality when released into the atmosphere. In turn,
   climate change may influence isoprene emissions through variations in
   occurrence and intensity of types of stress that affect plant functions.
   We test the effects of multiple drivers (temper-ature, precipitation,
   soil moisture, drought index, biomass, aerosols, burned fraction) on
   space retrievals of formaldehyde (HCHO) column concentrations, as a
   proxy for isoprene emissions, at global and regional scales over the
   period 2005-2016. We find declines in HCHO column concentrations over
   the study period across Europe, the Amazon Basin, southern Africa, and
   southern Australia, and increases across India, China, and mainland
   Southeast Asia. Temporal effects and the interactions among drivers are
   analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models to explain trends
   in HCHO column concentrations. Results show that HCHO column
   concentrations increase with temperature at the global scale and across
   the Amazon Basin and India-China regions, even under low levels of
   precipitation, provided that sufficient soil moisture can maintain
   vegetation functions and the associated isoprene emissions. Water
   availability sustains isoprene emissions in dry regions such as
   Australia, where HCHO column concentrations are positively associated
   with mean precipitation, with this relation intensifying at low levels
   of soil moisture. In contrast, isoprene emissions increase under water
   stress across the Amazon Basin and Europe, where HCHO column
   concentrations are negatively associated with levels of soil moisture
   and drought as calculated by the Standardized
   Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). This study confirms the
   key role of temperature in modulating global and regional isoprene
   emissions and highlights contrasting regional effects of water stress on
   these emissions.},

Abstract = {Concerns over regional climate change include its impact on air quality.
   A major contributor to unhealthy air quality is surface-based
   temperature inversions. Poor air quality is a serious public health
   concern that is often addressed by public health agencies. To assist
   with understanding the climatology and trend of temperature inversions
   for a large public health department, innovative pragmatic criteria were
   developed and used to determine morning and evening surface-based
   temperature inversions from datasets derived from Pittsburgh National
   Weather Service (NWS) radiosonde measurements made from 1 January 1991
   through 31 December 2020. During this 30-year period, the strength of
   the morning (7 a.m. EST; 12 UTC) inversions was 3.9 degrees C on
   average. The depth of the inversion layer measured an average height of
   246 m above the ground. The inversions tended to dissipate by 10 a.m.
   EST. The frequency of occurrence of morning inversions averaged 47\%.
   The mean strength of the evening (7 p.m. EST; 00 UTC) inversions was 1.1
   degrees C with a mean depth of 101 m above the ground. The frequency of
   evening inversion occurrence averaged 20\% during this period. The
   30-year climatology revealed generally declining frequency of inversions
   in the Pittsburgh area. Morning surface-based inversion strengths
   usually declined while morning depths and break times were steady.
   Evening inversion strengths and depths increased overall during the
   30-year period. Monthly means showed a morning-evening overlap of some
   months that record the most frequent substantial inversions during the
   fall time of the year, coinciding with the time when the worst air
   pollution events occur.},

Abstract = {Based on three global annual mean surface temperature time series and
   three Chinese annual mean surface air temperature time series, climate
   change trends on multiple timescales are analyzed by using the trend
   estimation method of multi-sliding time windows. The results are used to
   discuss the so-called global-warming hiatus during 1998-2012. It is
   demonstrated that different beginning and end times have an obvious
   effect on the results of the trend estimation, and the implications are
   particularly large when using a short window. The global-warming hiatus
   during 1998-2012 is the result of viewing temperature series on short
   timescales; and the events similar to it, or the events with even cold
   tendencies, have actually occurred many times in history. Therefore, the
   global-warming hiatus is likely to be a periodical feature of the
   long-term temperature change. It mainly reflects the decadal variability
   of temperature, and such a phenomenon in the short term does not alter
   the overall warming trend in the long term.},

Abstract = {Trend analyses of satellite and ground-based observations clearly
   indicate that temperatures and ozone concentrations in the upper
   stratosphere are undergoing long-term changes. Variations in solar
   ultraviolet radiation during the 11-year solar cycle are influencing
   stratospheric temperatures and photochemistry from above. Forcings from
   below result from the increasing atmospheric concentrations of
   long-lived trace constituents, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
   oxide, several chloro-fluorocarbons and other halocarbons. Using the
   LLNL two-dimensional chemical-radiative-transport model of the global
   atmosphere, we evaluate the influences of these external forcings on the
   middle atmosphere. Our calculations include recent estimates of the
   variations in solar ultraviolet radiation since 1974. Model results for
   the solar cycle effects on total ozone, upper stratospheric ozone and
   temperature are within the uncertainty (in some cases, large) range of
   observational data analyses. The model calculations including both solar
   variability and the effects of changing trace gas emissions can explain
   much of the observed trends in upper stratospheric ozone and temperature

Title = {Absence of Surface Water Temperature Trends in Lake Kinneret despite
   Present Atmospheric Warming: Comparisons with Dead Sea Trends},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study was carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1 km x 1 km resolution records on board Terra
   and Aqua satellites and in-situ measurements during the period
   (2003-2019). In spite of the presence of increasing atmospheric warming,
   in summer when evaporation is maximal, in fresh-water Lake Kinneret,
   satellite data revealed the absence of surface water temperature (SWT)
   trends. The absence of SWT trends in the presence of increasing
   atmospheric warming is an indication of the influence of increasing
   evaporation on SWT trends. The increasing water cooling, due to the
   above-mentioned increasing evaporation, compensated for increasing
   heating of surface water by regional atmospheric warming, resulting in
   the absence of SWT trends. In contrast to fresh-water Lake Kinneret, in
   the hypersaline Dead Sea, located similar to 100 km apart, MODIS records
   showed an increasing trend of 0.8 degrees C decade(-1) in summer SWT
   during the same study period. The presence of increasing SWT trends in
   the presence of increasing atmospheric warming is an indication of the
   absence of steadily increasing evaporation in the Dead Sea. This is
   supported by a constant drop in Dead Sea water level at the rate of
   similar to 1 m/year from year to year during the last 25-year period
   (1995-2020). In summer, in contrast to satellite measurements, in-situ
   measurements of near-surface water temperature in Lake Kinneret showed
   an increasing trend of 0.7 degrees C decade(-1).},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to understand spatial climate change in
   relation to temperature and precipitation, analysed in the last 3
   climatological standard normal periods (1961-1990; 1971-2000;
   1981-2010), in order to monitor and provide prevision about
   biodiversity, in the province of Macerata, central Italy. The data of 30
   weather stations for temperature and 60 rain gauges for precipitation
   from 1961 to 2010 were statistically interpolated, with the use of
   elevation as independent variable. Using an innovative map algebra,
   mathematical analysis and geostatistical steps in a GIS environment, we
   report the difference between interpolations of precipitation and
   temperatures detected in Macerata's territory in the last three
   climatological standard normal periods. The results have shown a general
   positive trend, with an increase of temperature of about 0.7 degrees C
   from 1961 to 1990 to 1981-2010 and an opposite tendency for
   precipitation with a decrease of about 30 mm from one standard period to
   the following one (1961-1990, 1981-2010). Furthermore, the analysis of
   areal variations between the different climatological standard normals
   has allowed the identification of some areas in countertrend, mainly
   located in the municipality area of Macerata for precipitation, and in
   the Sibillini mountains for temperature and precipitation. The areal
   variations reported are discussed in relation to climate change analysis
   and its assessment for future modelling studies on environmental
   monitoring and biodiversity loss prevention. The additional purpose of
   this analysis is to develop a new method of research to address
   small-scale environmental climate problems, avoiding generalizations
   that are sometimes unrepresentative.},

Title = {Gas Phase Oxidation of Carbon Monoxide by Sulfur Dioxide Radical Cation:
   Reaction Dynamics and Kinetic Trend With the Temperature},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Gas phase ion chemistry has fundamental and applicative purposes since
   it allows the study of the chemical processes in a solvent free
   environment and represents models for reactions occurring in the space
   at low and high temperatures. In this work the ion-molecule reaction of
   sulfur dioxide ion So(2)(+) with carbon monoxide CO is investigated in a
   joint experimental and theoretical study. The reaction is a fast and
   exothermic chemical oxidation of CO into more stable CO2 by a metal free
   species, as SO2+, excited into ro-vibrational levels of the electronic
   ground state by synchrotron radiation. The results show that the
   reaction is hampered by the enhancement of internal energy of sulfur
   dioxide ion and the only ionic product is SO (+). The theoretical
   approach of variational transition state theory (VTST) based on density
   functional electronic structure calculations, shows an interesting and
   peculiar reaction dynamics of the interacting system along the reaction
   path. Two energy minima corresponding to {[}S0(2)-00] (+) and {[}OS-OCO]
   (+) complexes are identified. These minima are separated by an
   intersystem crossing barrier which couples the bent B-3(2) state of CO2
   with C-2(v) symmetry and the (1)A(1) state with linear D-infinity h
   symmetry. The spin and charge reorganization along the minimum energy
   path (MEP) are analyzed and eventually the charge and spin remain
   allocated to the SO (+) moiety and the stable CO2 molecule is easily
   produced. There is no bottleneck that slows down the reaction and the
   values of the rate coefficient k at different temperatures are
   calculated with capture theory. A value of 2.95 x 10 (-10) cm(3)s
   (-1)molecule (-1) is obtained at 300 K in agreement with the literature
   experimental measurement of 3.00 x 10( -10) +/- 20\% cm(3)s( -l)molecule
   (-1), and a negative trend with temperature is predicted consistently
   with the experimental observations.},

Abstract = {A principal component decomposition of monthly sea surface temperature
   (SST) variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean demonstrates that nearly
   all of the linear trends during 1950-2010 are found in two leading
   patterns. The first SST pattern is strongly related to the canonical El
   Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) pattern. The second pattern shares
   characteristics with the first pattern and its existence solely depends
   on the presence of linear trends across the tropical Pacific Ocean. The
   decomposition also uncovers a third pattern, often referred to as ENSO
   Modoki, but the linear trend is small and dataset dependent over the
   full 61-year record and is insignificant within each season. ENSO Modoki
   is also reflected in the equatorial zonal SST gradient between the Nio-4
   region, located in the west-central Pacific, and the Nio-3 region in the
   eastern Pacific. It is only in this zonal SST gradient that a marginally
   significant trend arises early in the Northern Hemisphere spring
   (March-May) during El Nio and La Nia and also in the late summer
   (July-September) during El Nio. Yet these SST trends in the zonal
   gradient do not unequivocally represent an ENSO Modoki-like dipole
   because they are exclusively associated with significant positive SST
   trends in either the eastern or western Pacific, with no corresponding
   significant negative trends. Insignificant trends in the zonal SST
   gradient are evident during the boreal wintertime months when ENSO
   events typically mature. Given the presence of positive SST trends
   across much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, using fixed SST anomaly
   thresholds to define ENSO events likely needs to be reconsidered.},

Title = {Trends and drivers of land surface temperature along the urban-rural
   gradients in the largest urban agglomeration of China},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {711},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Urban heat magnitude and effects may represent harbingers of future
   climate change and the urban-rural gradients provide a unique natural
   laboratory for identifying both problems and solutions to climate change
   mitigation and adaptation. Here, we explored the trends and driving
   forces of land surface temperature (LST) along the urban-rural gradients
   of 26 cities in the largest urban agglomeration of China, the Yangtze
   River Delta Urban Agglomeration, using MODIS LST data combined with
   urban intensity, background climate, vegetation greenness, landscape
   structure, albedo, population and gross domestic product (GDP). We found
   that LST generally increased with increasing urban intensity along the
   urban-rural gradients while with large diurnal and seasonal variability.
   Large variability also existed between the maximum and minimum LST
   within the same urban intensity (e.g., 6.4 degrees C), suggesting cities
   themselves provide ready-made solutions (minimum) to resolving heat
   island problems. However, the range of LST within the same intensity
   decreased with the urban intensity and narrowed drastically when the
   intensity reached certain thresholds (e.g., 58-87\% varying with season,
   time of day, and city), implying that the space for climate mitigation
   is very limited once the urbanization intensity exceeds critical
   thresholds. The roles of landscape structure (composition and
   configuration) for greenspace and urban land have become increasingly
   important in driving the variation of LST with increasing urban
   intensity from low (20\%-30\%), middle (45\%-55\%) to high (70\%80\%),
   clearly indicating that subtle urban landscape designing, such as less
   aggregated urban configuration and more irregular greenspace shape are
   effective strategies to mitigate climate change in highly urbanized
   areas and cities themselves already provide such vivid demonstrations
   for us to find and learn. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important indicator of changes in
   the climate system and a key driver of marine ecosystems. Here we
   studied the strength and spatial patterns of changes in North Atlantic
   SST during the last three decades (1982-2010). Regional and local
   patterns of change were studied using data derived from the Advanced
   Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors. Apart from changes in
   mean SST, we studied changes in the seasonal cycle, in the spatial
   patterning of temperature anomalies and in the location of selected
   isotherms. We quantified the degree of nonlinearity in mean SST as an
   indicator of the rate at which SST trends changed during the study
   period. Changes in the timing and intensity of seasonal extremes were
   explored, and a heuristic method was used to derive the length of the
   period of stratification and to estimate its variation. Our results were
   in general coherent with the main impacts predicted by climate change
   projections, with greatest changes located at northern latitudes and
   near land. Marked variation in the spatial patterns was also found for
   different variables, strengthening the view that physical changes could
   be promoting the arrangement of novel marine biological communities. The
   observed changes in ocean SST highlighted the need of a more local and
   regional focus in future climate change studies.},

Abstract = {Ice breakup dates on lakes have a confirmed relationship with the local
   climates and are useful as a quantitative indicator of climate change,
   especially in the middle-high latitudes. Many lakes on the Eurasian
   continent freeze over in winter, but data on their ice breakup dates are
   incomplete. In this study, we attempt to infer ice breakup dates for 18
   lakes on the Eurasian continent using the proposed method based on
   long-term surface temperature (water temperature trend) and threshold
   surface temperature. The threshold surface temperature was estimated
   using reflectance data from the near infrared band together with surface
   temperature data derived from MODIS. After obtaining the estimated ice
   breakup dates, we compared them with observed results in order to
   evaluate our proposed method for ice breakup date estimation. According
   to this comparison, the estimation error of the ice breakup dates was
   less than three days. In the last stage of this study, we estimated the
   ice breakup dates at the centres of 18 Eurasian lakes from 2001 to 2003.
   The mean ice breakup dates on these lakes in 2002 were two weeks earlier
   than in 2003 and one week earlier than in 2001.},

Title = {Temporal trends in temperature-related mortality and evidence for
   maladaptation to heat and cold in the Eastern Mediterranean region},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {943},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The eastern Mediterranean region is characterized by rising temperature
   trends exceeding the corresponding global averages and is considered a
   climate change hot-spot. Although previous studies have thoroughly
   investigated the impact of extreme heat and cold on human mortality and
   morbidity, both for the current and future climate change scenarios, the
   temporal trends in temperature-related mortality or the potential
   historical adaptation to heat and cold extremes has never been studied
   in this region. This study focuses on cardiovascular mortality and
   assesses the temporal evolution of the Minimum Mortality Temperature
   (MMT), as well as the disease-specific cold- and heat-attributable
   fraction of mortality in three typical eastern Mediterranean
   environments (Athens, Thessaloniki and Cyprus). Data on daily
   cardiovascular mortality (ICD-10 code: I00-I99) and meteorological
   parameters were available between 1999 and 2019 for Athens, 1999 to 2018
   for Thessaloniki and 2004 to 2019 for Cyprus. Estimation of
   cardiovascular MMT and mortality fractions relied on time -series
   Poisson regressions with distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM)
   controlling for seasonal and long-term trends, performed over a series
   of rolling sub -periods at each site. The results indicated that in
   Athens, the MMT decreased from 23 degrees C (67.5th percentile) in
   1999-2007 to 21.8 degrees C (62nd percentile) in 2011-2019, while in
   Cyprus the MMT decreased from 26.3 degrees C (79th percentile) in
   2004-2012 to 23.9 degrees C (66.5th percentile) in 2011-2019. In
   Thessaloniki, the decrease in MMT was rather negligible. In all regions
   under study, the fractions of mortality attributed to both cold and heat
   followed an upward trend throughout the years. In conclusion, the
   demonstrated increase in cold attributable fraction and the decreasing
   temporal trend of MMT across the examined sites are suggestive of
   maladaptation to extreme temperatures in regions with warm climate and
   highlight the need for relevant public health policies and
   interventions.},

   surface temperature under current and future climates},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The decadal-scale global-mean surface temperature (GMST) trend
   fluctuates between rapid-warming, slow-warming and cooling under the
   combined action of external forcing (EX) and internal variability.
   However, the principal contributors to the time-varying trends of GMST
   across decadal scales in current and future climates remain elusive.
   Here, by leveraging observations and initial-condition large ensembles,
   we unravel that historical GMST trend fluctuations are predominantly
   driven by EX on timescales exceeding similar to 9 years within the
   current climate, with anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols being the
   primary drivers. However, in the warming climate, the significant
   contribution of EX on decadal scales is projected to decrease. This is
   primarily due to anthropogenic aerosol mitigation efforts and the
   absence of unpredictable volcanism. Despite the continuous increase in
   greenhouse gases, these factors are expected to delay the emergence of
   EX-dominance to similar to 14-year timescale. Our results quantitatively
   underscore the pivotal role of the EX in modulating GMST trend
   fluctuations and its potential weakening at decadal scales in the
   warming climate, indicating that predicting near-term changes in GMST
   may become less certain in the future.},

Title = {Evolution of seasonal land surface temperature trend in pond-breeding

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES},

Abstract = {BackgroundTemperature, as one of the effective environmental stimuli in
   many aspects of species life and ecosystems, can affect amphibians in
   many ways. Knowing and predicting temperature change and its possible
   effects on the habitat suitability and movements of amphibians have led
   many researchers to use climate change scenarios and species
   distribution models (SDMs). One of the important remote-sensing products
   that received less attention of conservation biologists is the land
   surface temperature (LST). Due to the small difference between LST and
   air temperature, this component can be used to investigate and monitor
   the daily and seasonal changes of habitats. This study aims to
   investigate the seasonal trend of LST in the habitat suitability and
   connectivity of the critically endangered newt (Neurergus derjugini) in
   its small distribution range, using the MODIS LST time series (2003 to
   2021) and with the help of SDMs, Mann-Kendall (MK) and Pettitt
   non-parametric tests.ResultsIn the last decade, the increasing trend of
   LST versus its decreasing trends is obvious. Based on MK and Pettitt
   tests, in the winter and spring, with the decrease in latitude of 35.45
   degrees and increase in longitude of 46.14 degrees, the core populations
   which are located in the southeast have experienced an increase in
   temperature. Considering the period time of breeding and overwintering,
   the continuity of winter and spring can be effective on the survival of
   adult newts as well as larvae in the microclimate. Linkages with the
   highest current flow between core populations in the winter and summer
   are the most likely to be vulnerable. At the level of habitat, the
   increase in LST is proportional to the trend of thermal landscape
   changes, and all seasons have had an increase in LST, but in winter and
   summer, the largest area of the habitat has been involved. By continuing
   the current trend, many high-altitude southern habitats in Iran will be
   endangered, and the species will be at risk of local
   extinction.ConclusionThe increasing trend of temperature in all seasons
   such as winter will affect many adaptations of the species and these
   effects are mostly evident in the southern parts of its distribution
   range therefore, captive breeding and reintroduction are recommended for
   the populations of these areas.},

Abstract = {We examine spatial and temporal variability in normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI), snow cover and land surface temperature (LST)
   in Himachal Pradesh between 2001 and 2017 using Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. Mann-Kendall trend tests and
   Sen's slope estimates indicate increasing NDVI trends during the
   postmonsoon period. Increasing snow cover trend is observed during
   winter and premonsoon whereas decreasing annual LST trends are observed
   for Himachal Pradesh. Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) indicate a
   strong positive correlation between NDVI and LST (PCC = .808) and strong
   negative correlation between LST and snow cover (PCC = -.809) and NDVI
   and snow cover (PCC = -.838). Coefficient of determination greater than
   .90, between MODIS LST and snow cover observations and weather station
   records, indicate fair representation of ground conditions using the
   MODIS dataset. Low (2.4 degrees C/1,000 m) and steep (7.1 degrees
   C/1,000 m) temperature lapse rate is observed during monsoon and winter,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {The mean trophic level, i.e.,the Mean Trophic Index (MTI) and Mean
   Temperature of the Catch (MTC) were estimated for Turkish waters in the
   Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea based on the reconstructed
   marine fisheries catches (consisting of N = 88 species and/or higher
   taxa) in Turkish waters for the year 1950 to 2010. The MTI decreased in
   both regions of Turkey, following expectations, but the MTC showed
   different trends in these two regions. It increased (by 0.48 degrees
   C.decade(-1)), along with the SST in the Eastern Mediterranean, while it
   fluctuated in the Black Sea. This fluctuating behaviour, however, was
   similar to the fluctuating tendency of SST in the Black Sea. This
   suggests that the MTI and MTC can be relied upon as indicators of
   fisheries impacts on ecosystems, and of the impact of changing
   temperatures on fisheries, respectively.},

Abstract = {We find that wintertime temperature anomalies near 4 hPa and 50 degrees
   N/S are related, through dynamics, to anomalies in ozone and
   temperature, particularly in the tropical stratosphere but also
   throughout the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. These mid-latitude
   anomalies occur on timescales of up to a month, and are related to
   changes in wave forcing. A change in the meridional Brewer-Dobson
   circulation extends from the middle stratosphere into the mesosphere and
   forms a temperature-change quadrupole from Equator to pole. We develop a
   dynamical index based on detrended, deseasonalised mid-latitude
   temperature. When employed in multiple linear regression, this index can
   account for up to 60\% of the total variability of temperature, peaking
   at similar to 5 hPa and dropping to 0 at similar to 50 and similar to
   0.5 hPa, respectively, and increasing again into the mesosphere. Ozone
   similarly sees up to an additional 50\% of variability accounted for,
   with a slightly higher maximum and strong altitude dependence, with zero
   improvement found at 10 hPa. Further, the uncertainty on all equatorial
   multiple-linear regression coefficients can be reduced by up to 35 and
   20\% in temperature and ozone, respectively, and so this index is an
   important tool for quantifying current and future ozone recovery.},

Title = {Scale-dependency of the global mean surface temperature trend and its
   implication for the recent hiatus of global warming},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {Studies of the global mean surface temperature trend are typically
   conducted at a single (usually annual or decadal) time scale. The used
   scale does not necessarily correspond to the intrinsic scales of the
   natural temperature variability. This scale mismatch complicates the
   separation of externally forced temperature trends from natural
   temperature fluctuations. The hiatus of global warming since 1999 has
   been claimed to show that human activities play only a minor role in
   global warming. Most likely this claim is wrong due to the inadequate
   consideration of the scale-dependency in the global surface temperature
   (GST) evolution. Here we show that the variability and trend of the
   global mean surface temperature anomalies (GSTA) from January 1850 to
   December 2013, which incorporate both land and sea surface data, is
   scale-dependent and that the recent hiatus of global warming is mainly
   related to natural long-term oscillations. These results provide a
   possible explanation of the recent hiatus of global warming and suggest
   that the hiatus is only temporary.},

Title = {Trend detection in surface air temperature in Ontario and Quebec, Canada
   during 1967-2006 using the discrete wavelet transform},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to detect trends in the mean surface
   air temperature over the southern parts of Ontario and Quebec, Canada,
   for the period of 1967-2006. This is accomplished by determining the
   most dominant periodic components that affect trends in different
   temperature data categories (monthly, seasonally-based, seasonal, and
   annual), which were obtained from a total of five stations. The discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT) technique, the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, and
   sequential Mann-Kendall analysis were used in this study - co-utilizing
   these techniques in temperature trend studies has not been explored
   extensively. The mother wavelet, number of decomposition levels, and
   boundary condition were determined using a newly proposed criterion
   based on the relative error of the MK Z-values between the original data
   and the approximation component of the last decomposition level. This
   study found that all stations experienced positive trends: significant
   trends were observed in all of the monthly, seasonally-based, and annual
   data. For the different seasons, although the trend values were all
   positive, not all stations experienced significant trends. It was found
   that high-frequency components ranging from 2 to 12 months were more
   prominent for trends in the higher resolution data (i.e. monthly and
   seasonally based). The positive trends observed for the annual data are
   thought to be mostly attributable to warming during winter and summer
   seasons, which are manifested in the form of multiyear to decadal events
   (mostly between 8 and 16 years). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Environmental conditions such as temperature, planktonic biomass, and
   ocean currents play an important role in the development and
   distribution of marine species. This work aims to estimate, in a high
   spatial resolution, the actual trends of sea surface temperature (SST)
   and chlorophyll -a concentration (Chl-a) and to assess the relationship
   with the local hydrodynamic conditions in the Alboran Sea. To
   investigate these objectives, time series of SST and Chl-a of satellite
   sensor data were analyzed during 20 years from January 2001 to December
   2020, using the Seasonal -Trend -Loess (STL) decomposition method and
   the Mann -Kendall seasonality test. The results, obtained with a 95\% of
   confidence, showed that the Alboran Sea basin is subject to sea surface
   warming evaluated at 0.027 +/- 0.008 degrees C per year, related to the
   warming of the Atlantic water mass, which contributes to a decrease of
   productivity evaluated at -0.0024 +/- 0.0003 mu g /l per year of Chl-a
   concentration. These trends are not homogeneous over the entire basin
   area but show a large regional variation between different parts of the
   Alboran Sea due to the hydrodynamic process of the Atlantic Jet -
   Western Alboran Gyre system (AJ-WAG), which is more active especially in
   summer/autumn seasons and contribute largely to these changes by mixing
   the waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.},

Title = {Bias Correction and Trend Analysis of Temperature Data by a
   High-Resolution CMIP6 Model over a Tropical River Basin},
Journal = {ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Technological advancements like increase in computational power have led
   to high-resolution simulations of climate variables by Global Climate
   Models (GCMs). However, significant biases exist in GCM outputs when
   considered at a regional scale. Hence, bias correction has to be done
   before using GCM outputs for impact studies at a local/regional scale.
   Six bias correction methods, namely, delta change (DC) method, linear
   scaling (LS), empirical quantile mapping (EQM), adjusted quantile
   mapping (AQM), Gamma-Pareto quantile mapping (GPQM) and quantile delta
   mapping (QDM) were used to bias correct the high-resolution daily
   maximum and minimum temperature simulations by Meteorological Research
   Institute-Atmospheric General Circulation Model Version 3.2
   (MRI-AGCM3-2-S) model which is part of Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), of Netravati basin, a tropical river basin on
   the south-west coast of India. The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots and
   Taylor diagrams along with performance indicators like Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency (NSE), the Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE) or Root-Mean Square
   Deviation (RMSD), the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Percentage BIAS
   (PBIAS) and the correlation coefficient (r) were used for the evaluation
   of the performance of each bias correction method in the validation
   period. Considerable reduction in the bias was observed for all the bias
   correction methods employed except for the LS method. The results of QDM
   method, which is a trend preserving bias correction method, was used for
   analysing the trend of future temperature data. The trend of historical
   and future temperature data revealed an increasing trend in the annual
   temperature. An increase of 0.051 degrees C and 0.046 degrees C is
   expected for maximum and minimum temperature annually during the period
   2015 to 2050 as per RCP 8.5 scenario. This study demonstrates that the
   application of a suitable bias correction is needed before using GCM
   projections for climate change studies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {The electronic structure, stability, chemical bonding and mechanical
   properties of 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal diboride TMB2 were
   investigated using first-principles calculations based on density
   functional theory. All the primary chemical bonds, i.e., metallic, ionic
   and covalent have contributions to the bonding of TMB2. The number of
   valence electrons of transition metals or the valence electron
   concentration (VEC) of TMB2 has strong effects on the lattice
   parameters, stability and mechanical properties of TMB2. Both lattice
   constants a and c decrease with VEC, but c decreases faster than a,
   which is attributed to the enhanced TM d-B p (sp(2)) bonding. Bulk
   modulus B of TMB2 increases continuously with VEC due to the enhanced TM
   d-B p (sp(2)) and TM dd bonding. Shear modulus G increases with VEC,
   reaching a maximum at VEC = 3.33, and then decreases with further
   increase of VEC. YB2 and MnB2 have low Young's modulus and are predicted
   to have good thermal shock resistance. According to Pugh's criterion
   (G/B < 0.571), MnB2, MoB2 and WB2 are predicted as ductile or damage
   tolerant ultrahigh temperature ceramics (UHTCs). Copyright (C) 2015, The

Abstract = {Whether stratospheric cooling due to increases in well-mixed greenhouse
   gases (WMGHG) could increase the depletion of Arctic stratospheric ozone
   has been the subject of scientific and public attention for decades.
   Here we provide evidence that changes in the concentrations of
   ozone-depleting substances (ODS), not WMGHG, have been the primary
   driver of observed Arctic lower stratospheric trends in both ozone and
   temperature. We do so by analyzing polar cap ozone and temperature
   trends in reanalysis data: these clearly suggest that both trends are
   mainly driven by ODS in the lower stratosphere. This observation-based
   finding is supported by results from a stratosphere-resolving
   chemistry-climate model driven with time-varying ODS and WMGHG,
   specified in isolation and in combination. Taken together, these results
   provide strong evidence that ODS are the main driver of changes in the
   Arctic lower stratospheric temperatures and ozone, whereas WMGHG are the
   primary driver of changes in the upper stratosphere.},

Abstract = {This study examined the results of 22 CMIP6 (Coupled Model
   Inter-comparison Project phase 6) Earth System Model (ESM) simulations
   for four regions on the Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine. A comparison
   between the historical simulations from the CMIP6 ESMs with
   observational sea surface and bottom temperature (SST, BT) data
   demonstrates that the eddy-permitting ESMs do not perform better than
   coarse-resolution non-eddy permitting models in terms of long-term
   trends. Eddy-permitting ESMs reduce model SST bias but not BT bias. In
   general, the 22 CMIP6 ESMs show limited skill for historical BT
   simulations in these shelf regions. Climate projections under ssp
   (Shared Socio-economic Pathways)245 and ssp370 for the 2020-2049 period
   suggest that the largest seasonal SST increase will occur in summer for
   both the Scotian Shelf and the Gulf of Maine. Under both climate
   scenarios, the SST of the Scotian Shelf (Gulf of Maine) increases by
   1.2-1.8 degrees C (1.4-1.7 degrees C) for the 2040-2049 period relative
   to 1995-2014, and bottom temperature increases by 1.2-1.6 degrees C
   (1.3-1.4 degrees C) for the same period. For SST, five models exhibit
   abnormally warm projections. The ESMs' performance against observations
   suggest the SST changes are probably underestimated, while the BT
   changes are likely overestimated.
   {[}Traduit par la redaction] La presente etude a examine les resultats
   de 22 simulations du modele de systeme Terre (MST) PCMCP6 (Projet de
   comparaison de modeles couples, phase 6) pour quatre regions de la
   plate-forme neo-ecossaise et du golfe du Maine. Une comparaison entre
   les simulations historiques des MST PCMCP6 et les donnees d'observation
   de la temperature de la surface de la mer et de la temperature au fond
   (TSM, TF) montre que les MST prenant en compte les tourbillons ne sont
   pas plus performants que les modeles a resolution grossiere ne prenant
   pas en compte les tourbillons en ce qui concerne les tendances a long
   terme. Les MST prenant en compte les tourbillons reduisent le biais des
   modeles TSM mais pas le biais TF. En general, les 22 MST PCMCP6 montrent
   une competence limitee pour les simulations historiques de TF dans ces
   regions du plateau continental. Les projections climatiques selon les
   scenarios SSP (profil socioeconomique partage) 245 et SSP370 pour la
   periode 2020-2049 donnent a penser que la plus forte augmentation
   saisonniere de la TSM se produira en ete a la fois pour la plate-forme
   neo-ecossaise et pour le golfe du Maine. Dans les deux scenarios
   climatiques, la TSM de la plate-forme neo-ecossaise (golfe du Maine)
   augmente de 1,2 a 1,8 degrees C (1,4 a 1,7 degrees C) pour la periode
   2040-2049 par rapport a 1995-2014, et la temperature du fond augmente de
   1,2 a 1,6 degrees C (1,3 a 1,4 degrees C) pour la meme periode. Pour la
   TSM, cinq modeles presentent des previsions anormalement chaudes. La
   performance des MST par rapport aux observations suggere que les
   changements de TSM sont probablement sous-estimes, tandis que les
   changements de TF sont probablement surestimes.},

Title = {New estimates of tropical mean temperature trend profiles from zonal
   mean historical radiosonde and pilot balloon wind shear observations},

Abstract = {Estimation of global scale trends and low-frequency variability directly
   from radiosonde temperature records is challenging particularly in the
   Tropics due to large biases in the earlier parts of the records that
   need to be adjusted. Zonal mean zonal winds and wind shear observations
   are less prone to time varying biases. Together with a zonal mean
   reference temperature trend profile in the extratropics, the wind data
   can be used to estimate zonal mean temperature trends in the tropics
   using the thermal wind relationship. Earlier estimates using this
   approach for the periods 1970-2005 and 1979-2005 showed strong trend
   amplification in the tropical upper troposphere but also very large
   uncertainties because the latitude for the reference profile was chosen
   very far north and due to a lack of data in the tropics. Both sources of
   uncertainties have been addressed by (i) using reference temperature
   profiles from homogenized radiosonde temperature data sets, (ii) using
   the new Global historical Radiosondes and Tracked Balloons Archive on
   standard pressure levels (GRASP) as data source that includes not only
   radiosondes but also pilot balloons, and (iii) more accurate vertical
   discretization and sampling of wind data. The new trend estimates are
   extended back to 1958 and are considerably less noisy. Trend
   amplification factors between 1.3 and 2.6 were found in the intervals
   1979-2005 and 1958-2010, respectively, when using wind shear
   information. The best estimates for the warming maxima in the upper
   tropical troposphere agree well with those directly from temperatures
   but tend to be located at higher altitudes.},

Title = {Ozone and temperature decadal trends in the stratosphere, mesosphere and

Journal = {ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {935-949},
Abstract = {We have derived ozone and temperature trends from years 2002 through
   2012, from 20 to 100 km altitude, and 48 degrees S to 48 degrees N
   latitude, based on measurements from the Sounding of the Atmosphere
   using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the
   Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)
   satellite. For the first time, trends of ozone and temperature measured
   at the same times and locations are obtained, and their correlations
   should provide useful information about the relative importance of
   photochemistry versus dynamics over the longer term. We are not aware of
   comparable results covering this time period and spatial extent. For
   stratospheric ozone, until the late 1990s, previous studies found
   negative trends (decreasing amounts). In recent years, some empirical
   and modeling studies have shown the occurrence of a turnaround in the
   decreasing ozone, possibly beginning in the late 1990s, suggesting that
   the stratospheric ozone trend is leveling off or even turning positive.
   Our global results add more definitive evidence, expand the coverage,
   and show that at mid-latitudes (north and south) in the stratosphere,
   the ozone trends are indeed positive, with ozone having increased by a
   few percent from 2002 through 2012. However, in the tropics, we find
   negative ozone trends between 25 and 50 km. For stratospheric
   temperatures, the trends are mostly negatively correlated to the ozone
   trends. The temperature trends are positive in the tropics between 30
   and 40 km, and between 20 and 25 km, at approximately 24 degrees N and
   at 24 degrees S latitude. The stratospheric temperature trends are
   otherwise mostly negative. In the mesosphere, the ozone trends are
   mostly flat, with suggestions of small positive trends at lower
   latitudes. The temperature trends in this region are mostly negative,
   showing decreases of up to similar to -3Kdecade(-1). In the lower
   thermosphere (between similar to 85 and 100 km), ozone and temperature
   trends are both negative. The ozone trend can approach similar to -10\%
   decade(-1), and the temperature trend can approach similar to
   -3Kdecade(-1). Aside from trends, these patterns of ozone-temperature
   correlations are consistent with previous studies of ozone and
   temperature perturbations such as the quasi-biennial (QBO) and
   semiannual (SAO) oscillations, and add confidence to the results.},

Abstract = {The surface meteorological data in Japan, beginning around the 1880s,
   archived by the Japan Meteorological Agency are analyzed focusing on the
   long-term trends and variations in humidity and temperature. It is found
   that the annual-mean temperature trend exhibits statistically
   significant warming of 1.0-2.5 degrees C century(-1) for most stations,
   while the annual-mean relative humidity shows significantly decreasing
   trend of -2 \% to -12 \% century(-1) for most stations with small
   seasonality. On the other hand, the annual-mean mixing ratio trend
   displays a different spatial distribution compared to the temperature or
   relative humidity trend. In this study, three types of trends exist:
   significantly positive and negative values, and virtually zero.
   Significantly negative trends of about -0.2 g kg(-1) to -0.3 g kg(-1)
   century(-1) are located approximately in the Pacific side of Honshu from
   the middle Tohoku through Shikoku to the eastern Kyushu. Significantly
   positive trends of about 0.2 g kg(-1) to 0.4 g kg(-1) century(-1) are
   observed over Hokkaido, the western Japan along Sea of Japan, the
   western Kyushu, and the remote islands including Okinawa. The overall
   pattern is similar for other seasons except for most of the remote
   islands in winter. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis
   indicates that the linear trends in the annual-mean temperature and
   relative humidity can be almost explained by the nearly uniform
   persistent warming and drying of EOF-1 components. On the other hand,
   for the annual-mean mixing ratio, EOF-2 is almost identical with the
   linear trend component, although the fraction of EOF-2 (14 \%) is much
   smaller than that of EOF-1 (49 \%). In recent years from 1960 to 2018
   the mixing ratio and temperature trends are very different from those in
   the longer period from the 1880s. The mixing ratio trend and the
   temperature trend increase on average from 0.0 g kg(-1) to 0.5 g kg(-1)
   century(-1) and from 1.5 degrees C to 2.5 degrees C century(-1),
   respectively},

Title = {Analysis of 24 years of mesopause region OH rotational temperature
   observations at Davis, Antarctica - Part 1: long-term trends},

Abstract = {The long-term trend, solar cycle response, and residual variability in
   24 years of hydroxyl nightglow rotational temperatures above Davis
   research station, Antarctica (68 degrees S, 78 degrees E) are reported.
   Hydroxyl rotational temperatures are a layer-weighted proxy for kinetic
   temperatures near 87 km altitude and have been used for many decades to
   monitor trends in the mesopause region in response to increasing
   greenhouse gas emissions. Routine observations of the OH(6-2) band
   P-branch emission lines using a scanning spectrometer at Davis station
   have been made continuously over each winter season since 1995.
   Significant outcomes of this most recent analysis update are the
   following: (a) a record-low winter-average temperature of 198.3 K is
   obtained for 2018 (1.7 K below previous low in 2009); (b) a long-term
   cooling trend of -1.2 +/- 0.51 K per decade persists, coupled with a
   solar cycle response of 4.3 +/- 1.02 K per 100 solar flux units; and (c)
   we find evidence in the residual winter mean temperatures of an
   oscillation on a quasi-quadrennial (QQO) timescale which is investigated
   in detail in Part 2 of this work.
   Our observations and trend analyses are compared with satellite
   measurements from Aura/MLS version v4.2 level-2 data over the last 14
   years, and we find close agreement (a best fit to temperature anomalies)
   with the 0.00464 hPa pressure level values. The solar cycle response
   (3.4 +/- 2.3 K per 100 sfu), long-term trend (-1.3 +/- 1.2 K per
   decade), and underlying QQO residuals in Aura/MLS are consistent with
   the Davis observations. Consequently, we extend the Aura/MLS trend
   analysis to provide a global view of solar response and long-term trend
   for Southern and Northern Hemisphere winter seasons at the 0.00464 hPa
   pressure level to compare with other observers and models.},

Title = {Impacts of Wetland Reclamation and Paddy Field Expansion on Observed

Abstract = {The warming or cooling effects on regional climate in response to early
   land use change may be strengthened, weakened, or eliminated by the same
   or opposite effect in the subsequent land use/management period. Taking
   the Sanjiang Plain in China as our study area, this paper analyzed the
   surface temperature change due to land use/land management changes from
   the mid-1950s to 2015, based on the land surface temperature response
   model and the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) method using remote
   sensing data, meteorological observation data, and reanalysis data.
   Results revealed a magnitude of monthly mean land surface warming up to
   1.31 degrees C due to the land use change from wetland to rain-fed
   farmland and a cooling effect of -1.32 degrees C caused by the land
   management change from rain-fed farmland to paddy fields during the
   growing season. The trends were confirmed using OMR method. Land surface
   temperature change based on remote sensing data was divided into
   radiative and nonradiative forcing. The nonradiative processes play a
   dominant role in regulating the local surface temperature. The monthly
   mean temperature differences in response to land use changes differ
   greatly during the growing season. The temperature difference was
   greater in May and June (spring) than in July and August (summer). Our
   study shows that the land use impact on regional climate could be
   switched dramatically, and it would be basically consistent with the
   impact of natural wetlands before reclamation in our study area right
   now, which provides important information for mitigating and adapting to
   global climate change at regional scale.
   Plain Language Summary The Sanjiang Plain was once part of the Great
   Northern Wilderness in China, which has experienced extensive wetland
   drainage and farmland development since the mid-1950s. Then, large areas
   of rain-fed farmland have been rapidly transformed into paddy fields
   since the 1990s due to land management policies change and the pursuit
   of economic interests. The impacts of these successive land use changes
   on surface temperature were analyzed synthetically. We found that the
   warming effect of wetland reclamation over 40years has been eliminated
   due to the cooling effect of paddy field expansion since the 1990s. For
   both the change of wetland reclamation and paddy field expansion, the
   temperature difference was greater in May and June (spring) than in July
   and August (summer).},

Abstract = {Using the reconstructed continuous and homogenized surface air
   temperature (SAT) series for 16 cities across eastern China (where the
   greatest industrial developments in China have taken place) back to the
   nineteenth century, the authors examine linear trends of SAT. The
   regional-mean SAT over eastern China shows a warming trend of 1.52
   degrees C (100 yr)(-1) during 1909-2010. It mainly occurred in the past
   4 decades and this agrees well with the variability in another SAT
   series developed from a much denser station network (over 400 sites)
   across this part of China since 1951. This study collects population
   data for 245 sites (from these 400+ locations) and split these into five
   equally sized groups based on population size. Comparison of these five
   groups across different durations from 30 to 60 yr in length indicates
   that differences in population only account for between 9\% and 24\% of
   the warming since 1951. To show that a larger urbanization impact is
   very unlikely, the study additionally determines how much can be
   explained by some large-scale climate indices. Anomalies of large-scale
   climate indices such as the tropical Indian Ocean SST and the Siberian
   atmospheric circulation systems account for at least 80\% of the total
   warming trends.},

Abstract = {A 120 year series of climate measurements at Armagh Observatory, a rural
   site in Northern Ireland, was analyzed to yield monthly, seasonal, and
   annual values of long-and short-wave irradiances which were then related
   to the measured changes in air temperature. Three quarters of the
   significant increase and large decadal variations in atmospheric
   long-wave radiation was associated with the concurrent changes measured
   in specific humidity; the remaining quarter was associated with
   increases in the concentrations of carbon dioxide and other
   anthropogenic radiatively active gases. Significant but smaller
   long-term decreases in short-wave solar irradiance reduced by half the
   net, all-wave radiation forcing at the surface. Together the changes in
   long-and short-wave irradiances at Armagh accounted for more than three
   quarters of the interannual variations in mean annual temperatures.
   Climate sensitivity to long-wave forcing at the surface, 0.121 degrees C
   per W m(-2), was 5 times greater than that to short-wave forcing, and
   two possible explanations for this difference, water vapor feedback and
   changes in atmospheric circulation, are discussed.},

Abstract = {We update observed temperature trends in the Mediterranean and the

   spatial features and investigate possible influences from urbanisation.
   Monthly mean temperature time-series of 370 stations are acquired from
   the CRUTEM4.6 and GSOD datasets and converted into suitable format for
   statistical analysis. The calculated annual and seasonal temperature
   linear trends for 1981-2020 indicate a strong warming with a MENA
   station average annual trend equal to 0.36?/decade and a faster warming
   rate for spring (0.43?/decade) and summer (0.45?/decade). These trends
   are correlated with longitude, revealing faster warming rates over the
   eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. The stations are characterised as
   rural or urban centre with the use of the Global Human Settlement Model
   (GHS-SMOD) spatial grid that accounts for population, city size and
   shape for the year 2000. The trend derived for the urban centre stations
   is an annually averaged 0.1?/decade greater than for the rural or all
   stations, and more prominent during summer and autumn. Hence a
   discernible, but small, urbanisation signature is revealed.},

Title = {A fractal climate response function can simulate global average
   temperature trends of the modern era and the past millennium},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {40},
Number = {11-12},
Pages = {2651-2670},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A climate response function is introduced that consists of six
   exponential (low-pass) filters with weights depending as a power law on
   their e-folding times. The response of this two-parameter function to
   the combined forcings of solar irradiance, greenhouse gases, and
   SO2-related aerosols is fitted simultaneously to reconstructed
   temperatures of the past millennium, the response to solar cycles, the
   response to the 1991 Pinatubo volcanic eruption, and the modern
   1850-2010 temperature trend. Assuming strong long-term modulation of
   solar irradiance, the quite adequate fit produces a climate response
   function with a millennium-scale response to doubled CO2 concentration
   of 2.0 +/- A 0.3 A degrees C (mean +/- A standard error), of which about
   50 \% is realized with e-folding times of 0.5 and 2 years, about 30 \%
   with e-folding times of 8 and 32 years, and about 20 \% with e-folding
   times of 128 and 512 years. The transient climate response (response
   after 70 years of 1 \% yearly rise of CO2 concentration) is 1.5 +/- A
   0.2 A degrees C. The temperature rise from 1820 to 1950 can be
   attributed for about 70 \% to increased solar irradiance, while the
   temperature changes after 1950 are almost completely produced by the
   interplay of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols. The
   SO2-related forcing produces a small temperature drop in the years
   1950-1970 and an inflection of the temperature curve around the year
   2000. Fitting with a tenfold smaller modulation of solar irradiance
   produces a less adequate fit with millennium-scale and transient climate
   responses of 2.5 +/- A 0.4 and 1.9 +/- A 0.3 A degrees C, respectively.},

Title = {Temperature variability and trends in the UT-LS over a subtropical site:
   Reunion (20.8° S, 55.5° E)},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {This paper mainly focuses on the trends and variability of the UT-LS
   temperature using radiosonde observations carried out over 16 years
   (January 1993 to December 2008) from a southern subtropical site,
   Reunion (20.8A degrees S, 55.5A degrees E), using a linear-regression
   fitting model. Two kinds of tropopause definitions, namely, cold point
   tropopause (CPT) and lapse rate tropopause (LRT) are used. In order to
   characterize and quantify the relationship between regional oceanic
   forcing and temperature at UT-LS, we took into account the Indian Ocean
   Dipole (IOD) for the estimation of temperature trends. Results show that
   the main component is the Annual Cycle (AC), particularly at tropopause
   (CPT, LRT) and in the lower stratosphere (LS) where more than 26.0 +/-
   2.4\% of temperature variability can be explained by AC. The influence
   of IOD on the variability of the temperature is at highest ratio at CPT
   and LS, with respectively 12.3 +/- 7.3\% and 13.1 +/- 5.9\%. The
   correlations between IOD and temperature anomalies at UT-LS are barely
   significant, which are found to be in close agreement with the results
   obtained by Rosenlof et al. (2008) over the western tropical Pacific
   Ocean. The temperature trend in the LS reveals a cooling of about -0.90
   +/- 0.40 K per decade. The cooling trend at LS is found to be in close
   agreement with the others studies. Trend estimates in the LS suggest
   that IOD forcing contributes to increasing cooling by about 0.16 +/-
   0.05 K per decade. Past works have shown that the additional carbon
   dioxide increase has a minor effect in the LS, and suggested that other
   effects than ozone and carbon dioxide changes have to be considered, in
   order to explain the observed temperature changes in the LS. From this
   study, we can suggest that the SST changes can be considered also, in
   addition to effects due to ozone and carbon dioxide changes, in order to
   explain the observed temperature changes in the LS. As a consequence,
   our results support the assumption that the Indian Ocean may have a
   slight impact on temperature variability and on temperature change in
   the LS over Reunion.},

Abstract = {The analysis of the high resolution gridded data (1 degrees x 1 degrees)
   of daily maximum, minimum and mean temperature for the 23 grids covering
   the Narmada basin has detected varying trends in the upper, middle and
   lower zones of the basin, based on the 40 years data from 1961-2008. The
   annual 1- day maximum temperature has been steadily increasing at the
   rate of 1.10 degrees C/100 yr, but the annual 1- day minimum temperature
   depicted a much higher rate in increase of 3.20 degrees C/100 yr with
   significant rising trend at 95\% significance level (test statistic: Z =
   +1.989) based on the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test for detection of
   trend in time series. The zone-wise temperature variation has been
   studied for two distinct time periods, each of 20 years viz. 1969-88 and
   1989-08. A divergent pattern is observed in minimum daily temperature
   trends in the various zones of the basin with significant rising trends
   in the lower zone and no significant trend in the upper zone during both
   time periods. Also a significant rising trend has been detected in the
   diurnal temperature range (DTR) in the lower zone during August (Z = +
   2.21), with no significant trends in other months.
   Significant rising trends have been detected in the mean monthly
   temperatures in the upper and middle zones, with no significant trend in
   lower zone. Similar pattern of significant rising trend have been
   detected in mean monthly temperatures during the principal winter
   (December and January) and summer months (April and May) in upper and
   middle zones of the basin. However, no significant trend has been
   detected during the principal monsoon months (July and August) for all
   the zones. As the basin is located in a semi-arid region and the
   perennial flows result from the contribution from the soil moisture and
   groundwater storages, any increase in the maximum and minimum
   temperatures will change the water availability scenario due to
   increased water demands from higher consumptive use requirements. To
   study the water demand scenario in the various zones in the basin, the
   potential evapotranspiration (PET) has been computed. Significant rising
   trends in PET were detected in all the zones, during the 1989-08 time
   slot, which indicates higher crop water requirement from the agriculture
   sector due to the increased temperatures. The comparison of the zonal
   annual rainfall (AR) with the actual evapotranspiration (AET) which
   gives an indication of the supply-demand scenario, has found that the
   annual AET has been greater than AR in the middle zone on 5 occasions
   during 1969-88 and subsequently increased to 10 occasions during
   1989-08, whereas in the lower zone the AET was greater than AR during
   most of the years in both time periods. This indicates increased water
   demands and lower rainwater availability under the changing climate
   scenario, in the middle and lower zones of Narmada basin, which calls
   for effective water resources development and management strategies.},

   per year. The short-term change in temperature has been evaluated by the
   Student t-test and linear trend. An increasing trend of approximately
   1.574 degrees C/35 years (alpha = 0.001) in the annual mean temperatures
   is found during the period from 1974 to 2008. Annual maximum
   temperatures have dramatically increased with 2.712 degrees C (alpha =
   0.001) over the last 35 years. Annual minimum temperatures have
   decreased, over the same period, but not statistically significant.
   Probably, this decrease in temperature can be ascribed to urbanisation
   or the amount of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the ambient air
   during the last years.},

Volume = {66},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) time-series collected in Irish waters
   between 1850 and 2007 exhibit a warming trend averaging 0.3 degrees C.
   The strongest warming has occurred since 1994, with the warmest years in
   the record being 2005, 2006, and 2007. The warming trend is superimposed
   on significant interannual to multidecadal-scale variability, linked to
   basin-scale oscillations of the ocean-atmosphere system. The dominant
   modes of low-frequency variability in North Atlantic SST records,
   investigated using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis,
   correspond to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the East
   Atlantic Pattern (EAP), and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index,
   respectively, accounting for 23, 16, and 9\% of the total variance in
   the dataset. Interannual variability in Irish SST records is dominated
   by the AMO, which, currently in its warm phase, explains approximately
   half of the current warm anomaly in the record. The EAP and the NAO
   influence variability in Irish SST time-series on a smaller scale, with
   the EAP also contributing to the current warm anomaly. After resolving
   the prevalent oscillatory modes of variability in the SST record, the
   underlying warming trend compares well with the global greenhouse effect
   warming trend. The anthropogenic contribution to the current warm
   anomaly in Irish SSTs was estimated at 0.41 degrees C for 2006, and this
   is predicted to increase annually.},

Title = {Recent Climatology (1991-2020) and Trends in Local Warm and Cold Season
   Extreme Temperature Days and Nights in Arabia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Arabian Peninsula (Arabia) is among the places to have experienced
   the greatest amount of warming during recent decades, and this trend is
   projected to continue. Specifics related to the characteristics
   (frequency, duration, and intensity) of extreme temperature events
   (ETEs) over Arabia as a whole are either largely outdated or limited
   only to specific areas. The seasonal ETE definitions commonly used in
   local studies are neither climatological- nor phenomenon-based. Using a
   novel and straightforward framework, the seasons of four extreme
   temperature types (extreme warm days/nights (EWDs/EWNs) and extreme cold
   days/nights (ECDs/ECNs)) were identified on the simultaneous basis of
   event occurrence and impact times. Assessments of ETE frequency,
   duration, and intensity and their recent changes were then provided
   based on the most recent climate data (1991-2020). Results showed that
   the use of traditional seasonal definitions (e.g., meteorological
   seasons) tends to assume a spatiotemporal homogeneity in the seasonality
   of ETEs and their potential risk levels throughout the year. The
   developed framework distinguished months with events that have larger
   potential impacts together with their local seasons. ETE seasons were
   found to vary at the regional and local scales and are better defined at
   both the local and phenomenon levels. Early extreme warm events were
   hotter, and those at locations with longer local warm seasons
   demonstrated higher intensities. ECDs tended to be more frequent at
   coastal locations, whereas ECNs were more frequent over southwestern
   Arabia. Early and late extreme cold events were much colder than those
   occurring mid-season. Trend analyses revealed generally increasing
   regional trends in the frequency of extreme warm events, whereas extreme
   cold events have declined. The duration (i.e., consecutive occurrences)
   and intensity of EWNs have been increasing at more locations, suggesting
   that urgent attention is needed within such an arid and hot climate type
   in which nighttime stress relief is already very limited.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to measure and analyze the effects of exterior
   annual temperature change on the interior temperature of a dripstone
   cave. The measurement was carried out in Hajnoczy Cave located in the
   southern part of the Bukk Mountains, Hungary.
   Although the cave has only one entrance known, there are more evidences
   that prove the strong effect of exterior conditions on the interior
   processes like temperature fluctuation and dripstone development. Using
   a high resolution wireless digital thermometer sensor network, the air
   temperature was measured at 10 points every 10 minutes for a longer
   period. The goal of our study is to analyze the spatial profile of air
   temperature of the cave that is developed during the summer and winter
   air circulation period between 11 November, 2012, and 10 April, 2013.
   Based on these data, different zones of the cave could be separated; and
   during the winter and summer conditions, the climatic variability of the
   entrance, the transitional, and the deep cave zone were described. The
   long-term analysis of the cave proved that the summer and winter air
   circulation changes are caused by the prolonged continuance of a below
   10 degrees C average daily temperature.},

Abstract = {A new and more extensive homogenised and gridded data set of surface air
   temperature (NESAT v.2) has been generated for Northeastern Spain. The
   aim of this compilation has been to extend, temporally, the preliminary
   estimations of the long-term variations and trends of the Catalonian
   temperature (Brunet, et al., 1999). The improved meteorological network
   for this region, composed of 23 records of non-urban stations, has been
   used to analyse the 1869-1998 period. To obtain a new regional
   time-series of monthly average of daily mean temperature, the gridded
   procedures proposed by Jones et al. (1986) have been applied to the
   adjusted data. Hence, a rectangular 3degrees X 4degrees
   latitude-longitude box, that covers our region from 40degrees-43degrees
   N and 0degrees-4degrees E, has been employed to accomplish this purpose.
   The seasonal and annual variations and trends of these data have been
   estimated by using usual statistical techniques (linear trends, low-pass
   filters, change point detection, etc.).
   The results show a moderate but highly significant regional warming
   (0.9degrees C) in the whole period, largely contributed by winter trend,
   in agreement with results observed at the global scale (i. e. Peterson,
   et al., 1999; Jones, et al., 1999). However, this warming has not
   occurred in a steady, monotonic fashion, but different thermal periods
   have been recorded. First, an initial long steady period of moderate but
   highly significant warming (0.01degrees C/year) has been observed
   between 1869-1949. Second, and intermediate short cool phase lasting
   until mid-1970s, associated with significant (95\% confidence level) but
   moderate cooling (-0.03degrees C/year). Third, an unprecedented fast,
   abrupt, strong and highly significant warming (0.07degrees C/year) has
   been recorded from the mid-1970s to the present. Furthermore, six out of
   the ten warmest years of this record have been registered in the last
   decade (1989-1998).},

Abstract = {The effects of hurricanes Irma and Maria and a severe drought on the
   temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture (under canopy and in the
   open) were calculated at 22 sites from 0-1045 m in northeastern Puerto
   Rico from 2001-2021, against the background short-term trend. Median and
   minimum air temperatures increased uniformly across the elevational
   gradient, 1.6 times as fast in the air under the canopy (+0.08 degrees
   C/yr) and 2.2 times as fast in the soil under the canopy (+0.11 degrees
   C/yr) as for air temperature in the open. There were no substantial
   moisture trends (average decrease <0.01 mm/yr). The peak effect of the
   hurricanes on under-canopy air temperature was the same as under-canopy
   soil temperature at 1000 m (+3, 0.7, 0.4 degrees C for maximum, median,
   minimum) but air maximum and minimum temperature peak effects were twice
   as high at 0 m (and soil temperatures stayed constant). Soil temperature
   hurricane recovery took longer at higher elevations. The peak effect of
   the hurricanes and the drought on the soil moisture was the same (but in
   opposite directions, +/- 0\%), except for the wettest months where
   drought peak effect was larger and increasing with elevation. Differing
   patterns with elevation indicate different ecosystem stresses.},

Abstract = {The development of temperature forecasting models for the state of
   Kerala using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)
   method is presented in this article. Mean maximum and mean minimum
   monthly temperature data, for a period of 47 years, from seven stations,
   are studied and applied to develop the model. It is expected that the
   time-series datasets of temperature to display seasonality (and hence
   non-stationary), and a possible trend (due to the fact that the data
   spans 5 decades). Hence, the key step in the development of the models
   is the determination of the non-stationarity of the temperature
   time-series, and the transformation of the non-stationary time-series
   into a stationary time-series. This is carried out using the Seasonal
   and Trend decomposition using Loess technique and
   Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test. Before carrying out this
   process, several preliminary tests are conducted for (1) finding and
   filling the missing values, (2) studying the characteristics of the
   data, and (3) investigating the presence of the trend and seasonality.
   The non-stationary temperature time-series are transformed to stationary
   temperature time-series, by one seasonal differencing and one firstorder
   differencing. This information, along with the original time-series, is
   further utilized to develop the models using the SARIMA method. The
   parsimonious and best-fit SARIMA models are developed for each of the
   fourteen variables. The study revealed that SARIMA(2, 1, 1)(1, 1, 1)(12)
   as the ideal forecasting model for eight out of the fourteen time-series
   datasets.},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Recent changes in ocean temperature have impacted marine ecosystem
   function globally. Nevertheless, the responses have depended upon the
   rate of change of temperature and the season when the changes occur,
   which are spatially variable. A rigorous statistical analysis of sea
   surface temperature observations over 25 years was used to examine
   spatial variability in overall and seasonal temperature trends within
   the wider Caribbean. The basin has experienced high spatial variability
   in rates of change of temperature. Most of the warming has been due to
   increases in summer rather than winter temperatures. However, warming
   was faster in winter in the Loop Current area and the south-eastern
   Caribbean, where the annual temperature ranges have contracted. Waters
   off Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas had a tendency towards cooling in
   winter, increasing the amplitude of annual temperature ranges. These
   detailed patterns can be used to elucidate ecological responses to
   climatic change in the region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Temperature trends in the UTLS region are under- reported, particularly
   in the Southern Hemisphere, and yet temperature is one of the most
   important indicators of changes in dynamical and radiative processes in
   the atmosphere. Here radiosonde data from Durban, South Africa ( 30.0
   degrees S, 30.9 degrees E) over the period 1980 to 2001 ( 22 years)
   between 250 and 20 hPa are used to derive a mean temperature climatology
   and to determine trends. The seasonal cycle at the 250- hPa level is
   anti- correlated with the seasonal cycles at the 150- hPa and 100- hPa
   heights. The 100- hPa level ( local tropopause) exhibits a minimum
   temperature in late summer and a maximum in winter, and closely
   corresponds to previous results for tropical regions. Based on a Fourier
   analysis, both the annual cycle ( AO) and the semi- annual cycle ( SAO)
   are dominant, although the former is about 4 times stronger. The AO is
   strongest at the 100- hPa height. A trend analysis reveals a cooling
   trend at almost all heights in the UTLS region, with a maximum cooling
   rate of 1.09 +/- 0.41K per decade, at 70- hPa. Cooling rates are in good
   agreement with other studies and are slightly higher in summer than in
   winter.},

Title = {Trends in temperature, Secchi depth, and dissolved oxygen depletion
   rates in the central basin of Lake Erie, 1983-2002},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {35-49},
Abstract = {We examined temperature trends in a 20-year set of monitoring records
   collected at multiple deep-water stations in the central basin of Lake
   Erie. Data collected were statistically corrected
   ({''}deseasonalized{''}) to remove biases resulting from irregular
   sampling intervals within years. Depth-integrated summer temperature has
   increased by an average (+/- SE) of 0.037 +/- 0.01 degrees C per year.
   An observed reduction of Secchi depth (SD) by 7 +/- 3 cm/y seems to be
   unrelated to variation in either total phosphorus (TP) or chlorophyll a
   concentrations. Midsummer midbasin SD values varied widely between 4 and
   10 m, possibly depending on whether phytoplankton were concentrated in
   the epilimnion (giving shallow SD), or whether phytoplankton had settled
   out of the epilimnion into the lower layers, giving deeper SD values.
   Hypolimnetic volume-corrected oxygen depletion (HVOD) rates have also
   been highly variable, ranging from 2.68 to 4.72 mg/L/mo. These rates are
   sensitive to production of oxygen in the thermocline and hypolimnion by
   photosynthetically active phytoplankton that have settled from the
   epilimnion. The HVOD rate in any year was correlated with the previous
   year's TP loading into Lake Erie. Since TP loading trends largely
   reflect the consequences of improving water treatment through the 1980s
   and increasing contributions from tributary run-off sediments through
   the 1990s, there is little direct evidence to suggest that the
   appearance of dreissenids has directly influenced hypolimnial oxygen
   depletion rates in the central basin. The observation that central-basin
   HVOD tracked the reductions in TP loadings through the 1980s may be the
   first affirmation that central basin hypolinmetic oxygen dynamics can be
   regulated by phosphorus inputs. This implies that TP loads must continue
   to be regulated if we wish to minimize oxygen depletion rates as a
   strategy to reduce the frequency of episodic central basin anoxia.},

Abstract = {Two algorithms have been proposed in this paper. One is another scanning
   t test of trend change points in regression slope coefficients in two
   phases, along with a coherency analysis of trend changes between two
   time series. It is different from the previously published scanning Fmax
   test of trend changes. The second is a fuzzy weighted moving average
   (FWMA). Then, the algorithms were applied to two series of monthly
   temperatures over global land and ocean surfaces for 1850-2021. The
   applied results show that significant changes in segment trends appeared
   in two gradations on the interdecadal and intradecadal scales. All
   subsample regression models were found to fit well with those data.
   Global warming started in April 1976 with a good coherency of warming
   trends between land and sea. The global warming ``hiatus{''} mainly
   occurred in SST cooling from November 2001 to April 2008, but was not
   evinced over land on interdecadal scales. The ``land/sea warming
   contrast{''} was detected only in their anomaly series, but disappeared
   in their standardized differences. We might refer to the anomalies in
   distribution N(0,s) as ``perceptual{''} indicators and refer to the
   standardized differences in N(0,1) as ``net{''} indexes.},

Abstract = {Several kinds of SiC-based ceramic fibers are presently fabricated on an
   industrial scale using precursor polymers. The Si-C-O ceramic fiber that
   was first developed in 1975, has high tensile strength and relatively
   high heat resistance. The Si-Ti-C-O fibers emerged after the Si-C-O
   fiber was developed. These fibers have been applied as reinforcement for
   aluminum wire, glass-ceramics, or silicon carbide matrix composite
   materials. Through the research work on these fiber reinforced metal or
   ceramic matrix composites, these fibers have increased heat resistance.
   In the past ten years, a new fabrication process of the fiber, a
   radiation curing method, has been developed. In addition, the conversion
   process of polymer precursors to ceramics and the thermal stability of
   the fibers have been widely studied at high-temperatures ranging above
   1500 K. These research works have successfully produced excellent
   SiC-based ceramic fibers with high-temperature resistance. These fibers

Abstract = {This paper compares the historical simulations and future projections of
   surface air temperature over the Tibetan Plateau of the updated Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project phase (CMIP6) and the precedent phase of
   the project (CMIP5) to quantify differences in the projections under
   different scenarios. Model evaluation for the historical period
   (1961-2005) indicates that the multi-model ensemble (MME) mean of CMIP6
   outperforms CMIP5 MME in simulating spatial-temporal characteristics of
   surface air temperature. The temperature changes relative to 1986-2005
   are projected in the near-term (2021-2040), mid-term (2041-2060), and
   long-term (2081-2100) future under Shared Socio-economic Pathway
   (SSP)2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 of CMIP6 and Representative Concentration
   Pathway (RCP)4.5 and RCP8.5 of CMIP5. The projected temperature shows
   larger increases in the long-term projection compared with the near- and
   mid-term projection under both SSPs and RCPs. CMIP6 MME projects higher
   temperature changes and accelerated warming trends relative to CMIP5
   MME. Additionally, the projected temperature increases and warming rates
   show a significant elevation dependency, especially in the long-term
   projection. The uncertainty for future projections is quantified by the
   square root of error variance (SREV) method. The results record a clear
   reduction in the uncertainty of CMIP6 temperature relative to CMIP5
   primarily concentrated at the elevation zones of over 5000 m. The
   analysis of the projected temperature over the Tibetan Plateau is of
   great significance for policy-makers to make socio-economic adjustments
   for the future warming. This study is conducive to the credibility of
   future temperature projections for CMIP6 and enhances our comprehension
   of the uncertainty of SSP and RCP scenarios.},

Abstract = {The reasons for the Holocene temperature conundrum, known as the
   inconsistency between the reconstructed cooling and the inferred warming
   simulations during the Holocene, remain unclear. Temperature
   reconstructions from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) provide important insights
   for understanding the Holocene temperature conundrum due to enhanced
   sensitivity to climate at high altitudes. Given the significant positive
   correlation between air temperature and delta O-18 in precipitation over
   the northern TP, the stable isotopic records of ice cores recovered from
   this area are widely used for paleotemperature reconstruction. Here we
   present a new high-resolution delta O-18 record from the Chongce ice
   cores to bedrock, dated back to 7 ka BP by the accelerator mass
   spectrometry (AMS)C-14 dating technique. Our reconstructed temperature
   record shows a long-term warming trend until similar to 2 ka BP,
   followed by an abrupt change to a relatively cool period until the start
   of the industrial-era warming. This record challenges the widely
   recognized Holocene reconstruction from the neighboring Guliya ice core.
   It is also different from many previous temperature reconstructions,
   most of which have summer biases and show a long-term cooling trend over
   the past two millennia. In addition, our record shows that temperatures
   during the recent decades are almost the highest during the past 7 ka
   BP, highlighting the unusual warming forced by anthropogenic greenhouse
   gases.},

Abstract = {Given the importance of climate for society at different scales, such as
   local, regional, and global scales, the analysis of trends of climatic
   elements improves the assessment of projections and variations, aiding
   in the design of policies focused on processes of adaptation to and
   mitigation of the effects of climate change. The aim of this study was
   to detect mean air temperature trends in the SertAo Paraibano mesoregion
   in Brazil by constructing temperature series with observed data provided
   by the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) collected in
   the localities of Patos and SAo Goncalo and with data estimated using
   Estima\_T software to study the spatial and temporal distribution of the
   mean air temperature of seven localities in the SertAo Paraibano
   mesoregion: agua Branca, Aguiar, Coremas, Patos, Princesa Isabel, SAo
   Goncalo, and Teixeira. The temperature series with observed and
   estimated data were compared, showing the variability of using
   temperature estimates to overcome the lack of meteorological stations in
   the study area. Descriptive analysis shows low data dispersion in
   relation to the annual mean values and, therefore, low variability. The
   monthly mean temperature pattern was similar in all localities and
   December was always the warmest month, whereas July was the coldest,
   both in the estimated and observed data series. The non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test indicated that estimated series show trends of
   significant increases in mean air temperature, in annual, biannual,
   quarterly, and monthly periods, in all localities. Sen's slope results
   indicate significant increases in temperature from 0.008 to 0.011
   degrees C/year.},

Abstract = {Critical speed path analysis using Dynamic Laser Stimulation (DLS)
   technique has been an indispensable technology used in the Semiconductor
   IC industry for identifying process defects, design and layout issues
   that limit product speed performance. Primarily by injecting heat or
   injecting photocurrent in the active diffusion of the transistors, the
   laser either slows down or speeds up the switching speed of transistors,
   thereby affecting the overall speed performance of the chip and
   revealing the speed limiting/enhancing circuits. However, recently on
   Qualcomm Technologies' 14nm FinFET technology SOC product, the 1340nm
   laser's heating characteristic revealed a Vt (threshold voltage)
   improvement behavior at low operating voltages which helped identify,
   process issues on multiple memory array blocks across multiple cores
   failing for MBIST (Memory Built-in Self-test). In this paper, we explore
   the innovative approach of using the laser to study Vt shifts in
   transistors due to process issues. We also study the laser silicon
   interactions through scanning the 1340nm thermal laser on silicon and
   observing frequency shifts in a high-speed Ring Oscillator (RO) on 16nm
   FinFET technology. This revealed the normal and reverse Temperature
   Dependency Gate voltages for 16nm FinFET, thereby illustrating the dual
   nature of stimulation (reducing mobility and improving Vt) from a
   thermal laser. Frequency mapping through Laser Voltage Imaging (LVI) was
   performed on the Ring Oscillator (RO) using the 1340nm thermal laser,
   while concurrently stimulating the transistors of the RO. Spatial
   distribution of stimulation was studied by observing the frequency
   changes on LVI.},

Abstract = {Water vapor-weighted mean temperature, T-m, is a vital parameter for
   retrieving precipitable water vapor (PWV) from the zenith wet delay
   (ZWD) of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signal propagation.
   In this study, the T-m at 368 GNSS stations for 2000-2012 were
   calculated using three methods: (1) temperature and humidity profiles
   from ERA-Interim, (2) the Bevis T-m-T-s relationship, and (3) the Global
   Pressure and Temperature 2 wet model. T-m derived from the first method
   was used as a reference to assess the errors of the other two methods.
   Comparisons show that the relative errors of the T-m derived from these
   two methods are in the range of 1-3\% across more than 95\% of all the
   stations. The PWVs were calculated using the aforementioned three types
   of T-m and the GNSS-derived ZWD at 107 stations. Again, the PWVs
   calculated using T-m from the first method were used as the reference of
   the other two PWVs. The root-mean-square errors of these two PWVs are
   both in the range of 0.1-0.7mm. The second method is recommended in
   real-time applications, since its performance is slightly better than
   the third method. In addition, the linear trends of the PWV time series
   from the first method were also used as the reference to evaluate the
   trends from the other two methods. Results show that 13\% and 23\% of
   the PWV trends from the respective second and third methods have a
   relative error of larger than 10\%. For climate change studies, the
   first method, if available, is always recommended.},

Title = {Factors contributing to diurnal temperature range trends in twentieth

Abstract = {Trends in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) are examined in the late
   twentieth and the twenty-first centuries in a coupled climate model
   representing the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface systems.
   Consistent with past studies, the DTR decreases during this time. These
   decreases are concentrated in middle latitudes, with much smaller
   changes occurring in the low latitudes. Strong seasonal characteristics
   to this pattern exist, although these are different in either
   hemisphere. In the model integrations, variations in the DTR are much
   more sensitive to changes in feedbacks than in direct forcings. The DTR
   is found to be insensitive to the scattering of sunlight by sulfate
   aerosols and the increased mean temperature. Instead, variations in the
   DTR arise mostly from changes in clouds and in soil moisture.
   Consequently, the decreasing trends stem from increases in the
   reflection of solar radiation by clouds moderated by decreases in soil
   moisture, mostly through its effect on the ground heat capacity. Both
   factors contribute about equally to the DTR trend. The exception to this
   relation occurs in the middle latitudes during winter, when snow cover
   reduces the influence of changes in solar radiation and soil moisture.
   Decreases during this season are a consequence of the artificial
   tendency in the model for the DTR to be very small when the mean
   temperature is near the freezing point. While the accuracy of these
   conclusions depends upon the model's ability to represent the relevant
   processes, the results highlight the importance of clouds and land
   surface processes to the DTR and its long-term change. The importance of
   soil moisture found here implies that changes in the physiological
   response of vegetation and in land use could have important effects on
   the DTR.},

Title = {Radiative analysis of global mean temperature trends in the middle
   atmosphere: Effects of non-locality and secondary absorption bands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {138},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this paper, we provide a refined and extended assignment of past and
   future temperature changes relative to previous analyses and describe
   and evaluate the relevance of vertical coupling and non-linear and
   secondary radiative mechanisms for the interpretation of climatic
   temperature variations in the middle atmosphere. Because of their
   nature, the latter mechanisms are not adequately accounted for in most
   regression analyses of temperature trends as a function of local
   constituent variations. These mechanisms are examined using (1) globally
   averaged profiles from transient simulations with the Canadian Middle
   Atmosphere Model (CMAM) forced by changes in greenhouse gases and ozone
   depleting substances and (2) a one-dimensional radiative-equilibrium
   model forced using the diagnosed global mean changes in radiatively
   active constituents as derived from the CMAM model runs. The conditions
   during the periods 1975 to 1995 and 2010 to 2040 (during which the rates
   of change in ozone and CO2 differ) provide a suitable contrast for the
   role of the non-linear and non-local mechanisms being evaluated in this
   paper to be clearly differentiated and evaluated. Vertical coupling of
   radiative transfer effects and the influence of secondary absorption
   bands are important enough to render the results of multiple linear
   regression analyses between the temperature response and constituent
   changes misleading. These effects are evaluated in detail using the 1D
   radiative-equilibrium model using profiles from the CMAM runs as inputs.
   In order to explain the differences in the CMAM temperature trends prior
   to and after 2000 these other radiative effects must be considered in
   addition to local changes in the radiatively active species. The middle
   atmosphere temperature cools in response to CO2 and water vapor
   increases, but past and future trends are modulated by ozone changes.

Abstract = {Surface melt on the Greenland ice sheet has been increasing in intensity
   and extent over the last decades due to Arctic atmospheric warming.
   Surface melt depends on the surface energy balance, which includes the
   atmospheric forcing but also the thermal budget of the snow, firn and
   ice near the ice sheet surface. The temperature of the ice sheet
   subsurface has been used as an indicator of the thermal state of the ice
   sheet's surface. Here, we present a compilation of 4612 measurements of
   firn and ice temperature at 10 m below the surface (T10m) across the ice
   sheet, spanning from 1912 to 2022. The measurements are either
   instantaneous or monthly averages. We train an artificial neural network
   model (ANN) on 4597 of these point observations, weighted by their
   relative representativity, and use it to reconstruct T10m over the
   entire Greenland ice sheet for the period 1950-2022 at a monthly
   timescale. We use 10-year averages and mean annual values of air
   temperature and snowfall from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset as model
   input. The ANN indicates a Greenland-wide positive trend of T10m at 0.2
   circle C per decade during the 1950-2022 period, with a cooling during
   1950-1985 (-0.4 circle C per decade) followed by a warming during
   1985-2022 (+0.7 circle per decade). Regional climate models HIRHAM5,
   RACMO2.3p2 and MARv3.12 show mixed results compared to the observational
   T10m dataset, with mean differences ranging from -0.4 circle C (HIRHAM)
   to 1.2 circle C (MAR) and root mean squared differences ranging from 2.8
   circle C (HIRHAM) to 4.7 circle C (MAR). The observation-based ANN also
   reveals an underestimation of the subsurface warming trends in climate
   models for the bare-ice and dry-snow areas. The subsurface warming
   brings the Greenland ice sheet surface closer to the melting point,
   reducing the amount of energy input required for melting. Our
   compilation documents the response of the ice sheet subsurface to
   atmospheric warming and will enable further improvements of models used
   for ice sheet mass loss assessment and reduce the uncertainty in
   projections.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the regional
   vegetation change on the seasonal surface air temperature and is
   performed using the Max-Planck-Institute Earth System Model. The
   research area is located in the Pannonian Basin and is one of many
   regions in which the anthropogenic impact on geophysical changes in the
   environment is significant. The vegetation system in this region is
   constantly changing, and its impact on the Earth's climate system is
   very complicated to present. The study covers a 10-year period from
   years 2002 until 2011, and it shows that the change in percentage
   between certain types of vegetation leads to heating and cooling of
   surface air during the summer season. The highest cooling is in the
   northern area of the Pannonian Basin, which is approximately - 0.3
   (degrees C/year) while in the central area is around - 0.1 (degrees
   C/year). Warming occurs only in the southern area, where the air heating
   trend coefficient is 0.1 (degrees C/year). The largest vegetation cover
   changes are made in the northern area while smaller ones in the central
   and southern. These changes in vegetation cover lead to an increase of
   surface albedo in the northern and central areas, while in the southern
   there is a decrease. It also has been shown that these changes in
   vegetation cover affected the surface sensible heat flux and total cloud
   cover.},

Abstract = {The response of tropical forests to global climate variability and
   change remains poorly understood. Results from long-term studies of
   permanent forest plots have reported different, and in some cases
   opposing trends in tropical forest dynamics. In this study, we examined
   changes in tree growth rates at four long-term permanent tropical forest
   research plots in relation to variation in solar radiation, temperature
   and precipitation. Temporal variation in the stand-level growth rates
   measured at five-year intervals was found to be positively correlated
   with variation in incoming solar radiation and negatively related to
   temporal variation in night-time temperatures. Taken alone, neither
   solar radiation variability nor the effects of night-time temperatures
   can account for the observed temporal variation in tree growth rates
   across sites, but when considered together, these two climate variables
   account for most of the observed temporal variability in tree growth
   rates. Further analysis indicates that the stand-level response is
   primarily driven by the responses of smaller-sized trees (less than 20
   cm in diameter). The combined temperature and radiation responses
   identified in this study provide a potential explanation for the
   conflicting patterns in tree growth rates found in previous studies.},

Title = {A holistic review on the recent trends, advances, and challenges for
   high-precision room temperature liquefied petroleum gas sensors},
Journal = {ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {1253},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is mainly composed of hydrocarbons,
   such as propane and butane, is a flammable gas that is considered a
   clean source of energy. Currently, the overwhelming use of LPG as fuel
   in vehicles, domestic settings, and industry has led to several
   incidents and deaths globally due to leakage. As a result, the
   appropriate detection of LPG is vital; thus, gas-sensing devices that
   can monitor this gas rapidly and accurately at room temperature, are
   required. This work reviews the current advances in LPG gas sensors,
   which operate at room temperature. The influences of the synthesis
   methods and parameters, doping, and use of catalysts on the sensing
   performance are discussed. The formation of heterostructures made from
   semiconducting metal oxides, polymers, and graphene-based materials,
   which enhance the sensor selectivity and sensitivity, is also discussed.
   The future trends and challenges confronted in the advancement of LPG
   room temperature operational gas sensors, and critical ideas concerning
   the future evolution of LPG gas sensors, are deliberated. Additionally,
   the advancements in the next-generation gas sensors, such as the
   wireless detection of LPG leakage, self-powered sensors driven by
   triboelectric/piezoelectric mechanisms, and artificial intelligent
   systems are also reviewed. This review further focuses on the use of
   smartphones to circumvent the use of costly instruments and paves the
   way for cost-efficient and portable monitoring of LPG. Finally, the
   approach of utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) to detect/monitor the
   leakage of LPG has also been discussed, which will provide better alerts
   to the users and thus minimize the effects of leakages.},

   occur against the background of global warming. Accordingly, another
   task of the current work was to identify cyclic components and determine
   their physical nature. A quasi-two-year, 5-6-year, solar activity cycle

Title = {Recent Trends of Abnormal Sea Surface Temperature Occurrence Analyzed

Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {In this study a tendency of abnormal sea surface temperature (SST)
   occurrence in the seas around South Korea is analyzed from daily SST
   data from satellite and 14 buoys from August 2020 to July 2021. As
   thresholds 28 degrees C and 4 degrees C are used to determine marine
   heatwaves (MHWs) and abnormal low water temperature (ALWT),
   respectively, because those values are adopted by the National Institute
   of Fisheries Science for the breaking news of abnormal temperature. In
   order to calculate frequency of abnormal SST occurrence spatially by
   using satellite SST, research area was divided into six areas of coast
   and three open seas. ALWT dominantly appeared over a wide area (7,745
   km(2)) in Gyeonggi Bay for total 94 days and it was also confirmed from
   buoy temperature showing an occurrence number of 47 days. MHWs tended to
   be high in frequency in the coastal areas of Chungcheongdo and
   Jeollabukdo and the south coastal areas while in case of buoy
   temperature Jupo was the place of high frequency (32 days). This
   difference was supposed to be due to the low accuracy of satellite SST
   at the coasts. MHWs are also dominant in offshore waters around Korean
   Peninsula. Although detecting abnormal SST by using satellite SST has
   advantage of understanding occurrence from a spatial point of view, we
   also need to perform detection using buoys to increase detection
   accuracy along the coast.},

Title = {An analysis of the meteorological variables leading to apparent
   temperature in Australia: Present climate, trends, and global warming
   simulations},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {107},
Pages = {145-156},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study is a comprehensive analysis of thermal comfort and apparent
   temperature around Australia. It includes a long-term historical trend
   analysis using observational weather station data, in which it was found
   that eight out of the ten chosen urban locations experienced warming
   trends in temperature and/or the apparent temperature over the second
   half of the twentieth century. Annual trends in temperature and apparent
   temperature were studied spatially across Australia using high
   resolution ERA Interim reanalysis data over the period 1979 to 2010. The
   reanalysis revealed that generally the apparent temperature is warming
   faster than the air temperature, amplifying the expected exposure to
   discomfort due to global warming in the subtropical region. Future
   apparent temperature trends were explored using high resolution Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project 3 model data to assess the impacts of
   global warming on human comfort. A best practice model for the
   Australian climate was used as well as best case and worst case scenario
   models selected using the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
   Research Organisation Representative Climate Futures framework. It was
   found that at 2070 using the AIR emissions scenario the temperature is
   projected to warm faster than the apparent temperature by up to 1
   degrees C in central Australia, suggesting that the cooling power of the
   wind can partially offset the impacts of global warming. This occurs in
   conjunction with the accelerated drying predicted to occur in many areas
   of Australia in future climates.
   Finally, the impact of the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Southern
   Annular Mode on the spatial characteristics of the temperature and
   apparent temperature around Australia was studied. This revealed that
   the inherent atmospheric humidity variability of these large-scale
   processes resulted in milder thermal comfort conditions across Australia
   regardless of whether the temperature was anomalously warm or cool.
   Using an apparent temperature framework, this study looks into many
   facets of the Australian climate uncovering knowledge that is useful for
   risk assessments as well as future urban planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Long-term trends and regime shifts in sea surface temperature on the

Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {27},
Number = {18},
Pages = {2313-2328},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {We investigated sea surface temperature (SST) variability over large
   spatial and temporal scales for the continental shelf region located off
   the northeast coast of the United States between Cape Hatteras, North
   Carolina, and the Gulf of Maine using the extended reconstruction sea
   surface temperature (ERSST) dataset. The ERSST dataset consists of 2
   degrees x 2 degrees (latitude and longitude) monthly mean values
   computed from in situ data derived from the International Comprehensive
   Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). Nineteen 2 degrees x 2 degrees bins
   were chosen that cover the shelf region of interest between the years of
   1854 and 2005. Mean annual and range of SST were examined using dynamic
   factor analysis to estimate trends in both parameters, while
   chronological clustering was used to determine temporal SST patterns and
   breakpoints in the time series that are believed to signal regime shifts
   in SST. Both SST and SST trend analysis show that interannual
   variability of SST fluctuations shows strong coherence between bins,
   with declining SST at the beginning of the last century, followed by
   increasing SST through 1950, and then rapidly decreasing between 1950
   and mid-1960s, with somewhat warmer SST thereafter to present. Annual
   SST range decreases in a seaward direction for all bins, with strong
   coherence for interannual variability of range fluctuations between
   bins. The trend in SST range shows a decreasing range at the beginning
   of the last century followed by an increase in range from 1920 to the
   late-1980s, remaining high through present with some spatial
   variability. A more detailed spatial analysis was conducted by grouping
   the data into 7 regions using principal component analysis. We analyzed
   regional trends in mean annual SST, seasonal SST range (summer
   SST-winter SST), and normalized SST minima and maxima. Both the summer
   and winter seasons were also analyzed using the length of each season
   and amplitude of the warming and cooling season, respectively, along
   with the spring warming and fall cooling rates. Trends in all of the
   parameters were examined after low-pass filtering using a 10-point
   convolution filter (n = 10 years) and regime shifts were identified
   using the sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts (STARS) method.
   The analysis shows some difference between regions in the timing of
   minimum SST with minima being reached I month earlier in the south
   (February) relative to more northern regions (March). Regional annual
   SST range decreased in a seaward direction. Amplitude of summer warming
   and the length of summer have shown fluctuations with recent years
   showing stronger warming and longer summers but generally not exceeding
   past levels. Overall, the difference in SST range, with recent larger
   values may be the most significant finding of this work. SST range
   changes have the potential to disrupt species important to local
   fisheries due to combinations of differing temperature tolerances,
   changes in reproduction potential, and changes in the distributional
   range of species. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The large ensembles of the IPSL-CM6A-LR model output for the historical
   forcing experiment were employed to investigate the role of internal
   variability in the formation of the recent ``warm Arctic-cold
   Eurasia{''} trend pattern in winter surface air temperature (SAT). The
   ensemble-mean SAT shows a positive trend over Arctic during 1990-2014,
   indicating a positive contribution of anthropogenic forcing to the
   warming Arctic. Over the region of central Eurasia, the ensemble-mean
   SAT trend is opposite to the observed trend. The winter SAT trends
   display remarkable inter-member diversity over the Barents-Kara Seas
   (BKS) region and central Eurasia, suggesting an important role played by
   internal variability. In addition to anthropogenic forcing, the results
   suggest that the barotropic anticyclone over northern Eurasia arising
   from internal variability can also contribute positively to the warming
   anomalies over the BKS region. On the other hand, through a fingerprint
   pattern matching method, it is found that the observed cooling trend
   over central Eurasia tends to be predominantly due to the internal
   variability. Finally, the results estimate that the internal variability
   can contribute to about 50-60\% of the observed warming trend over the
   BKS region.},

Title = {A Trend Analysis of Leaf Area Index and Land Surface Temperature and
   Their Relationship from Global to Local Scale},

Abstract = {Although the way in which vegetation phenology mediates the feedback of
   vegetation to climate systems is now well understood, the magnitude of
   these changes is still unknown. A thorough understanding of how the
   recent shift in phenology may impact on, for example, land surface
   temperature (LST) is important. To address this knowledge gap, it is
   important to quantify these impacts and identify patterns from the
   global to the regional scale. This study examines the trend and linear
   regression modeling of the leaf area index (LAI) and LST derived from
   the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data,
   specifically to assess their spatial distribution and changing trends at
   the continental and regional scales. The change detection analysis of
   interannual variability in the global LAI and LST between two periods
   (2003-2010 and 2011-2018) demonstrates more positive LAI trends than
   negative, while for LST most changes were not significant. The
   relationships between LAI and LST were assessed across the continents to
   ascertain the response of vegetation to changes in LST. The regression
   between LAI and LST was negative in Australia (R-2 = 0.487 {*}{*}{*}),
   positive but minimal in Africa (R-2 = 0.001), positive in North America
   (R-2 = 0.641 {*}{*}{*}), negative in Central America (R-2 = 0.119),
   positive in South America (R-2 = 0.253 {*}) and positive in Europe (R-2
   = 0.740 {*}{*}{*}). Medium temperatures enhance photosynthesis and
   lengthen the growing season in Europe. We also found a significant
   greening trend in China (trendp = 0.16 {*}{*}{*}) and India (trendp =
   0.13 {*}{*}{*}). The relationships between LAI and LST in these most
   prominent greening countries of the world are R-2 = 0.06 and R-2 = 0.25
   for China and India, respectively. Our deductions here are twofold-(1)
   In China, an insignificant association appeared between greening trend
   and temperature. (2) In India, the significant greening trend may be a
   factor in lowering temperatures. Therefore, temperature may stabilize if
   the greening trend continues. We attribute the trends in both countries
   to the different land use management and climate mitigation policies
   adopted by these countries.},

Title = {Near-Term Projections of Global and Regional Land Mean Temperature
   Changes Considering Both the Secular Trend and Multidecadal Variability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Near-term climate projections are needed by policymakers; however, these
   projections are difficult because internally generated climate
   variations need to be considered. In this study, temperature change
   scenarios in the near-term period 2017-35 are projected at global and
   regional scales based on a refined multi-model ensemble approach that
   considers both the secular trend (ST) and multidecadal variability (MDV)
   in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
   simulations. The ST and MDV components are adaptively extracted from
   each model simulation by using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition
   (EEMD) filter, reconstructed via the Bayesian model averaging (BMA)
   method for the historical period 1901-2005, and validated for 2006-16.
   In the simulations of the ``medium{''} representative concentration
   pathways scenario during 2017-35, the MDV-modulated temperature change
   projected via the refined approach displays an increase of 0.44A degrees
   C (90\% uncertainty range from 0.30 to 0.58A degrees C) for global land,
   0.48A degrees C (90\% uncertainty range from 0.29 to 0.67A degrees C)
   for the Northern Hemispheric land (NL), and 0.29A degrees C (90\%
   uncertainty range from 0.23 to 0.35A degrees C) for the Southern
   Hemispheric land (SL). These increases are smaller than those projected
   by the conventional arithmetic mean approach. The MDV enhances the ST in
   13 of 21 regions across the world. The largest MDV-modulated warming
   effect (46\%) exists in central America. In contrast, the MDV
   counteracts the ST in NL, SL, and eight other regions, with the largest
   cooling effect (220\%) in Alaska.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change on north temperate freshwater ecosystems
   include increasing water temperatures and decreasing ice cover. Here we
   compare those trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes at three spatial
   scales to evaluate how warming varies across the surface of these
   massive inland water bodies. We compiled seasonal ice cover duration
   (1973-2013) and lake summer surface water temperatures (LSSWT;
   1994-2013), and analyzed spatial patterns and trends at lake-wide, lake
   sub-basin, and fine spatial scales and compared those to reported lake-
   and basin-wide trends. At the lake-wide scale we found declining ice
   duration and warming LSSWT patterns consistent with previous studies. At
   the lake sub-basin scale, our statistical models identified distinct
   warming trends within each lake that included significant breakpoints in
   ice duration for 13 sub-basins, consistent linear declines in 11
   sub-basins, and no trends in 4 sub-basins. At the finest scale, we found
   that the northern- and eastern-most portions of each Great Lake,
   especially in nearshore areas, have experienced faster rates of LSSWT
   warming and shortening ice duration than those previously reported from
   trends at the lake scale. We conclude that lake-level analyses mask
   significant spatial and temporal variation in warming patterns within
   the Laurentian Great Lakes. Recognizing spatial variability in rates of
   change can inform both mechanistic modeling of ecosystem responses and
   planning for long-term management of these large freshwater ecosystems.},

Abstract = {We present a comparison of temperature trends using different satellite
   and radiosonde observations and climate (GCM) and chemistry-climate
   model (CCM) outputs, focusing on the role of photochemical ozone
   depletion in the Antarctic lower stratosphere during the second half of
   the twentieth century. Ozone-induced stratospheric cooling peaks during
   November at an altitude of approximately 100 hPa in radiosonde
   observations, with 1969 to 1998 trends in the range of -3.8 to -4.7
   K/dec. This stratospheric cooling trend is more than 50\% greater than
   the previously estimated value of -2.4 K/dec, which suggested that the
   CCMs were overestimating the stratospheric cooling, and that the less
   complex GCMs forced by prescribed ozone were matching observations
   better. Corresponding ensemble mean model trends are -3.8K/dec for the
   CCMs, -3.5K/dec for the CMIP5 GCMs, and -2.7K/dec for the CMIP3 GCMs.
   Accounting for various sources of uncertainty-including sampling
   uncertainty, measurement error, model spread, and trend confidence
   intervals-observations and CCM and GCM ensembles are consistent in this
   new analysis. This consistency does not apply to each individual that
   makes up the GCM and CCM ensembles, and some do not show significant
   ozone-induced cooling. Nonetheless, analysis of the joint ozone and
   temperature trends in the CCMs suggests that the modeled
   cooling/ozone-depletion relationship is within the range of
   observations. Overall, this study emphasizes the need to use a wide
   range of observations for model validation as well as sufficient
   accounting of uncertainty in both models and measurements.},

Title = {Trends and anomalies in sea-surface temperature, observed over the last

Abstract = {The Oceanographic Society of Gipuzkoa has recorded daily sea-surface
   temperature (SST) measurements, since 2nd July 1946, on a (nearly) daily
   basis. Sixty years of SST measurements (1947-2007) have been considered,
   in order to analyse the hydrographic trends and anomalies at the
   southeastern Bay of Biscay. The study reviews initially the consistency
   and reliability of the time-series; and trends and anomaly patterns.
   Then, the periodicity of the series; a reference period, for analysing
   seasonality during the period 2001-2007; and oceano-meteorological
   coupling within the period 2001-2007, with reference to the baseline
   period, have been determined. Within this context, a slight cooling
   trend has been observed for the whole of the time-series, in contrast to
   the warming over the last three-decadal period. Regarding the
   periodicity of the series, several cycles have been identified, with
   periods of about 8, 11 and 18 years; these represent the influence of
   climate cycles over the (local) SST series. Additionally, seasonal
   anomaly patterns between 2001 and 2007 have been examined based upon the
   selected reference period (1980-2002). Several extreme seasonal events
   have been observed, such as warm summer SST values in 2003 and 2006 and
   cold winter values in 2005. Such events can be explained by the
   ``deseasonality{''} phenomenon, observed throughout the study period. In
   addition to the direct influence of atmospherical parameters, such as
   air temperature and irradiance on SST dynamical variables (turbulence
   and upwelling-downwelling) account also for this coupling. Overall,
   despite the marginal location and surface character of the time-series,
   it reveals anomalies that agree with those described for larger zones of
   the northeastern Atlantic Ocean; hence, it can be characterised as being
   a reliable and representative long-term SST series. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {Detecting the contributions of internal variability and external forcing
   to the evolution of surface air temperature (SAT) trend at regional
   scales is a challenge. Based on the observations and large-ensemble
   simulations of climate models, we estimate the contribution of the
   internal and forced components to the evolution of East Asian winter
   land SAT (EAWT) during 1961-2018. Although the external forcing induced
   EAWT trends show a slow increase, both the total and internally
   generated EAWT trends exhibit a decrease with the extension of the time
   period, suggesting a critical role of internal variability in the
   evolution of the EAWT trends. The internal variability contributes to
   about 70\% of total EAWT trends during 1961-1995. With the extension of
   the time period, the contribution of internal variability decreases,
   whereas the contribution of external forcing gradually grows to dominate
   the EAWT trends. Based on the dynamical adjustment method, we identify
   that the internal dynamics and forced thermodynamics account for a
   majority of internal and forced EAWT variations, respectively. We
   further identify that the multidecadal fluctuation of internal component
   of autumn Arctic sea ice is a critical precursor of the internal
   variability, especially the internal dynamically induced EAWT
   variations, through triggering a meridional stationary Rossby wave
   response in the following boreal winter. Our findings provide an insight
   into the understanding of the present and future climate change over
   East Asia.},

Title = {Sensitivity of trends to estimation methods and quantification of

Abstract = {Climate trends estimated using historicalradiosoundingtime series may be
   significantly affected by the choice of the regression method to use, as
   well as by a subsampling of the dataset often adopted in specific
   applications. These are contributions to the uncertainty of trend
   estimations, which have been quantified in literature, although on
   specific pairs of regression methods, and in the not very recent past
   characterized by smaller trends in temperature than those observed over
   the last two decades. This paper investigates the sensitivity of trend
   estimations to four linear regression methods (parametric and
   nonparametric) and to the artificial subsampling of the same dataset
   using historical radiosounding time series from 1978 onwards, available
   in the version 2 of the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA).
   Results show that long-term decadal trends may have not negligible
   uncertainties related to the choice of the regression method, the
   percentage of data available, the amount of missing data and the number
   of stations selected in the dataset. The choice of the regression
   methods increases uncertainties in the decadal trends ranging from -0.10
   to -0.01 K.da(-1)for temperature in the lower stratosphere at 100 hPa
   and from 0.2 to 0.8\% da(-1)for relative humidity (RH) in the middle
   troposphere at 300 hPa. Differences can also increase up to 0.4
   K.da(-1)at 300 hPa when the amount of missing data exceeds 50\% of the
   original dataset for temperature, while for RH, significant differences
   are observed in the lower troposphere at 925 hPa for almost all
   datasets. Finally, subsampling effects on trend estimation are
   quantified by artificially reducing the size of the IGRA dataset:
   Results show that subsampling effects on trend estimations when at least
   60 stations, up to 76\% of data available, are considered for
   temperature and at least 40 stations for RH.},

Title = {Surface temperature cooling trends and negative radiative forcing due to

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},

Abstract = {Greenhouse horticulture has experienced in recent decades a dramatic
   spatial expansion in the semiarid province of Almeria, in southeastern
   (SE) Spain, reaching a continuous area of 26,000 ha in 2007, the widest
   greenhouse area in the world. A significant surface air temperature
   trend of -0.3 degrees C decade(-1) in this area during the period
   1983-2006 is first time reported here. This local cooling trend shows no
   correlation with Spanish regional and global warming trends. Radiative
   forcing (RF) is widely used to assess and compare the climate change
   mechanisms. Surface shortwave RF (SWRF) caused through clearing of
   pasture land for greenhouse farming development in this area is
   estimated here. We present the first empirical evidences to support the
   working hypothesis of the development of a localized forcing created by
   surface albedo change to explain the differences in temperature trends
   among stations either inside or far from this agricultural land. SWRF
   was estimated from satellite-retrieved surface albedo data and
   calculated shortwave outgoing fluxes associated with either uses of land
   under typical incoming solar radiation. Outgoing fluxes were calculated
   from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface
   reflectance data. A difference in mean annual surface albedo of +0.09
   was measured comparing greenhouses surface to a typical pasture land.
   Strong negative forcing associated with land use change was estimated
   all year round, ranging from -5.0 W m(-2) to -34.8 W m(-2), with a mean
   annual value of -19.8 W m(-2). According to our data of SWRF and local
   temperatures trends, recent development of greenhouse horticulture in
   this area may have masked local warming signals associated to greenhouse
   gases increase.},

Abstract = {A homogenized daily mean temperature series from 1915 to 2021 at Beijing
   Observatory (BO) has been developed. A thorough investigation of
   observation records and historical metadata was carried out to identify
   specific non-climatic biases. The inhomogeneities were detected and
   adjusted with the optimally selected reference stations using a
   statistical reduction methodology. The results indicated three types of
   non-climatic biases in temperature records: the first was the relocation
   of BO from suburban to urban, which caused positive shifts in
   temperature records, especially for wintertime; the second arose from
   different methods for calculating daily mean temperature, which caused
   different sign biases varying with months; and the last was caused by
   the transition from manual to automatic measurements with site-specific
   biases. The corresponding adjustments due to three type biases ranged
   from -1.13 to 0.63, -0.29 to 0.23 and -0.13 to 0.00 degrees C,
   respectively. The new homogenized annual mean temperature series showed
   a warming trend of 0.199 degrees C/decade during 1915-2021. The trend
   was more pronounced in winter than in the other three seasons. The
   warming trend in the new series is greater than those in the previous
   homogenized series (0.136-0.177 degrees C/decade), primarily due to the
   more effective adjustment associated with the site relocation,
   particularly for more urban locations.
   A new homogenized daily temperature series from 1915 to 2021 was
   developed based on updated metadata for the Beijing Observatory. The new
   series shows a warming trend of 0.199 degrees C/decade, greater than
   those in the previous homogenized series due to the more effective
   adjustment associated with the site relocation. image},

   recurrent infections in multiple host taxa. Infection prevalence was
   highest in spring, but infections occurred throughout the entire year
   with an average of 2.3 host taxa infected per time point (ranging from 0
   to 10 host taxa) and an average infection prevalence of 2.78\% (ranging
   from 0\% to 47.35\%). Infected host biomass equalled that of the
   carnivorous zooplankton and decreased over time, while infection
   prevalence remained unchanged. Seasonal infection prevalence increased
   with phytoplankton biomass, but decreased with increasing temperature
   and phosphorus concentrations, reflecting that peak prevalence occurred
   in spring when temperature and phosphorus concentrations were relatively
   low. In contrast, seasonally-detrended prevalence increased with
   temperature, but decreased with increasing phosphorus concentrations.
   Chytrids are a common component of the pelagic plankton community with
   sizeable biomass and removing an-at times-substantial proportion of the
   primary production, challenging the long-standing underrepresentation of
   parasites in ecological studies. Chytrids responded differentially to
   seasonal variation and long-term trends in host density, water
   temperature and nutrient availability, highlighting the need to
   disentangle seasonal signals from long-term changes.},

Abstract = {The dependence of the glass-transition temperature (T(g)), Urbach-tail
   slope (DELTA), and optical gap (E03) on the chemical composition in
   As-Se-Te glasses has been studied. It was found that both T(g) and DELTA
   are compositionally invariant, while E03 increases with increasing
   selenium content. It is supposed that softening of the studied glasses
   is controlled by the strength of the As-As bonds, a fraction of which is
   compositionally invariant. Similarly the As-As bonds broken during glass
   formation are supposed to be responsible for frozen-in potential
   fluctuations giving rise to the Urbach tail. Hence the As-As bonds and
   broken As-As bonds control both T(g) and DELTA, which were found
   interrelated DELTA almost-equal-to 1.3k(B)T(g). On the other hand, the
   optical gap is controlled by anion substitution, and the E03(x)
   dependence can be calculated using the virtual crystal model (VCM). The
   bowing parameter calculated using VCM has been found to be gamma=0.54
   eV, in good agreement with experiment.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the long-term development of fog occurrences in
   the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP). Specifically, it analyzes the
   roles of meteorological and air quality parameters as potential drivers
   for fog formation. A dataset reaching back to the year 1933 shows that
   the overall trends of the annual fog occurrences (AFO) coincide with
   those of the annual mean temperature. Air quality data have been
   available since 1998, allowing us to perform a statistical analysis of
   the contributions of meteorology and air quality to AFO for the period
   from 1998 to 2018. The logistic regression model shows that the binary
   dependent variable (daily fog occurrence, FO) is explained by its
   independent predictors PM10, relative humidity (rH), and daily minimum
   temperature (T-min), in that order. FO was not found to be significantly
   influenced by atmospheric pressure (aP) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). While
   the influence of SO(2)was minor and associated with less confidence, it
   was negative. Potential causes for these surprising results are
   discussed. We conclude that the parameters PM10, rH, and T(min)are
   significant drivers of fog formation in the MASP, whereby the total
   explanatory power of the drivers for the dichotomous variable FO is
   16\%.},

Title = {Inconsistent sea surface temperature and salinity changing trend in the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The South China Sea (SCS) is an important moisture and heat source in
   the Asian monsoon system, and its environmental changes influence
   economic and social stability in Southeast Asia and East Asian. Previous
   records on sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) were mostly
   from one sediment core, and/or only showed fragmentary information. It
   is hard to provide insights into the mechanisms of the overall
   paleoceanographical environmental variability in the northern SCS. In
   this study, paired delta O-18 and Mg/Ca records of planktonic
   foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber from Core S0204B nearby the Luzon
   Strait (21 degrees 13.818'N, 118 degrees 3.077', water depth 1822 m),
   and Core GHE 27L (19.85 degrees N, 115.34 degrees E, water depth of 1533
   m) in the central northern SCS, were analyzed, so as to better
   understand the physical process of the SST and SSS changes in the
   northern SCS and its relationship with the tropical Pacific. The results
   demonstrate that the SST is relatively stable and seawater delta O-18
   (delta O-18(sw)) values, a salinity proxy, shows a decrease trend since
   7.0 ka BP in Core S02048. By contrast, SST and delta O-18(sw) in Core
   GHE 27L exhibit an overall increasing trend at the same time, indicating
   apparent regional discrepancy on the changing trend of the SST and SSS
   in the northern SCS. We suggest that the thermal and hydrographic
   conditions in Core S0204B were primarily influenced by the outer western
   Pacific water. However, the thermal and hydrographic conditions in Core
   GHE 27L may be predominantly controlled by the weakened Asian monsoon
   during the mid-late Holocene, which was induced by the southern
   migration of Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and stronger EI Nino
   Southern Oscillation.},

Abstract = {During boreal winter, anomalous temperature regimes (ATRs), including
   cold air outbreaks (CAOs) and warm waves (WWs), provide important
   societal influences upon the United States. The current study analyzes
   reanalysis and model data for the period from 1949 to 2011 to assess (i)
   long-term variability in ATRs, (ii) interannual modulation of ATRs by
   low-frequency modes, and (iii) the representation of ATR behavior in
   models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   (CMIP5).No significant trends in either WWs or CAOs are identified for
   the continental United States. On interannual time scales, CAOs are
   modulated by the (i) North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the U.S.
   Southeast and (ii) the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern over the
   Northwest. WW frequency is modulated by (i) the NAO over the eastern
   United States and (ii) the combined influence of the PNA, Pacific
   decadal oscillation (PDO), and ENSO over the southern United States. In
   contrast to previous studies of seasonal-mean temperature, the influence
   of ENSO upon ATRs is found to be mainly limited to a modest modulation
   of WWs over the southern United States. Multiple linear regression
   analysis reveals that the regional collective influence of low-frequency
   modes accounts for as much as 50\% of interannual ATR variability.
   Although similar behavior is observed in CMIP5 models, WW (CAO)
   frequency is typically overestimated (underestimated). All models
   considered are unable to replicate observed associations between ATRs
   and the PDO. Further, the collective influence of low-frequency modes
   upon ATRs is generally underestimated in CMIP5 models. The results
   indicate that predictions of future ATR behavior are limited by climate
   model ability to represent the evolving behavior of low-frequency modes
   of variability.},

Abstract = {Saudi Arabia has one of the biggest water shortages and the least
   vegetation in the world, which is presumed to provoke this problem
   further due to climate change. Therefore, the present study investigates
   the water, vegetation, and temperature over Al-Asfar Lake region, Al
   Ahsa, Eastern province of Saudi Arabia using the Normalized Difference
   Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and
   Land Surface Temperature (LST: degrees C) from Landsat-8 based
   operational land imager (OLI) measurements for the period 2013 to 2023.
   This study presented annual and seasonal (dry months: June-September and
   wet months: December-April) spatiotemporal distribution and variations,
   calculated their absolute change and trends, and examined their
   relationship. Results showed positive NDWI values over Al-Asfar Lake,
   indicating waterbodies; while positive NDVI values on the lake's bank,
   signifying vegetation. Notably, there were significant temporal
   variations in water and vegetation observed on annual, seasonal, and
   monthly scales. The study also found an overall decrease in vegetation
   areas of 5.36 km2 in 2023 compared to 2013, while waterbodies increased
   by 8.83 km2. The trend analysis using area-averaged data demonstrated
   that NDWI increased on annual (0.0075/year) and seasonal (dry:
   0.0083/year and wet: 0.0049/year) scales, while NDVI decreased (annual:
   0.0066/year, dry: 0.0083/year, and wet: 0.0009/year). Moreover, LST was
   recorded least amount over waterbodies (28.23 degrees C) and vegetation
   (32.45 degrees C) covered areas compared to the entire lake region
   (38.43 degrees C), respectively. Remark, LST displayed decreasing trends
   over waterbodies (-0.05/year), followed by vegetation (-0.17/year), and
   the entire lake region (-0.0001/year), signifying that water and
   vegetation are vital components to controlling land surface temperature
   in this region. Finally, the LST showed a positive correlation with NDVI
   and negative correlation with NDWI. There may be a direct and indirect
   impact of climate change upon NDVI, LST, and NDWI as shown by the
   decreases in NDVI and LST and an increase in NDWI. This study can be
   considered as a base document to monitor waterbodies, vegetation cover,
   and temperature changes using remote sensing measurements of NDWI, NDVI,
   and LST, which will assist policymakers in developing water re- source
   management, irrigation planning, and environmental monitoring
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Zn and Co incorporated with Fe2O4 show different magnetic behaviors, the
   former can be adjusted between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic while
   the later one displays ferromagnetic ordering. This work presents a
   mixed system of Co-Zn with Fe2O4 for its potential applications in
   optical communication, data storage, and magneto-optical devices.
   ZnxCo1-xFe2O4 (x = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00) nanostructures were
   prepared through Sol-Gel method followed by annealing at 800 \& DEG;C.
   XRD results showed the cubic nature of all samples with grain sizes of
   14-21 nm having high values of specific surface area (71-81 m2 g-1). A
   linear increase in lattice constant from 8.3934 to 8.4322 \& ANGS; is
   reported with the increase in Zn+2 concentration from 0 to 1, i.e.,
   following Vegard's law. Magnetic properties for x = 0.5 sample studied
   up to 5 K, and an improvement has been reported, e.g., Ms from 40 to 88
   emu.g-1, Hc up to 2236 Oe, nB from 1.72 to 3.75 \& mu;B,Hex up to 32.44
   Oe, and \& alpha;Y-K ranged from 50 \& DEG; to 16 \& DEG;. Switching is
   reported in direct B.G for x = 0.25, x = 0.50, and in indirect B.G for x
   = 0.75. Prepared nanostructures have long ranged nonlinear refractive
   index (0.48-5.34) and metallization criterion from 0.37 to 0.45.
   Increased Zn+2 content in CoFe2O4 resulted a decrease in Urbach energy
   from 318 to 141 meV. High values of lattice dielectric constant, direct
   B.G and large values of activation energies, optical and electrical
   conductivities suggested that prepared samples (especially with x =
   0.50) have potential for use in efficient electronic devices such as
   sensors, photoconductors, solar cells and high-capacity energy storage
   devices such as supercapacitors. Dielectric and optoelectronic
   properties for ZnxCo1-xFe2O4 surpassed all the previous work.},

Abstract = {The present study investigated seasonal and spatial characteristics of
   the trends in surface air temperature (SAT) over Central Asia during
   1979-2018 and the relative contributions of dynamic and thermodynamic
   effects using a dynamical adjustment methodology. Regional averaged
   total SAT shows the largest rising rate in spring and its trend is not
   obvious in winter. The thermodynamically effect induces a widespread
   warming trend in most of Central Asia in all the four seasons. The
   dynamically induced SAT trends exhibit obvious seasonal and regional
   differences. Both dynamic and thermodynamic effects play a crucial role
   in the total SAT increasing trend in spring, the thermodynamic effect is
   predominantly responsible for SAT warming and the dynamic effect has a
   secondary contribution in summer, the rising temperature in autumn is
   attributed to the thermodynamic effect and the dynamic effect has a
   negative but insignificant contribution, and the total SAT trend in
   winter is small due to opposite contributions of thermodynamic and
   dynamic effects. Further analysis revealed that the changes in the
   Scandinavia pattern (SCAND) during 1979-2018 are likely the cause of
   dynamically induced temperature trends in spring, autumn and winter. The
   dynamical component of summer SAT trends over eastern Central Asia is
   contributed by the interdecadal transition of the Atlantic multidecadal
   oscillation (AMO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). Those climate
   modes contribute to SAT variations via their effects on wind-induced
   temperature advection and surface heat fluxes.},

Title = {Phenotypic plasticity following weaning: winter body mass trends and

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Our knowledge is limited on how weaned mammals adjust to environmental
   events in the absence of maternal assistance in the polar north. With
   the expectation that weaned offspring should express the adaptive
   potential of the mature phenotype, we determined their appetite and body
   mass responses to extreme cold. Between December and May when mean daily
   temperature (T-a, degrees C) was between - 48 and 2.3 we provided five
   naturally weaned reindeer calves (Rangifer tarandus L.) ad libitum a
   pelleted feed of 11\% crude protein with access to snow only in
   individual fenced outdoor pens in interior Alaska (64 degrees N 147
   degrees W). We predicted voluntary food intake would meet maintenance of
   body mass, but that extreme cold would result in an increase in appetite
   that would be compensated for by access to warm water. A linear mixed
   effect model indicated a moderate daily increase in body mass from 55.9
   +/- 1.6 kg on 9 December to 59.2 +/- 0.6 kg on 14 May and a moderate
   increase in intake that was evidence for maintenance of thermal
   homeostasis. However, at both low (<= 30) and high (>= 10) T-a (degrees
   C) intake increased and we estimated a lower critical temperature of -
   22 and upper critical temperature at - 10 that was indicative of high
   total-body insulation. Despite the appetite response at low T-a,
   provision of warm water did not affect intake. Thus, whereas adult
   reindeer restrict intake by mobilization of endogenous reserves the calf
   thermogenic response was an increase in appetite that indicated the
   importance of access to a food base for calves in winter.},

Title = {Exploring differences in spatial patterns and temporal trends of

Volume = {64},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Phenological models are widely used to estimate the influence of weather
   and climate on plant development. The goodness of fit of phenological
   models often is assessed by considering the root-mean-square error
   (RMSE) between observed and predicted dates. However, the spatial
   patterns and temporal trends derived from models with similar RMSE may
   vary considerably. In this paper, we analyse and compare patterns and
   trends from a suite of temperature-based phenological models, namely
   extended spring indices, thermal time and photothermal time models.
   These models were first calibrated using lilac leaf onset observations
   for the period 1961-1994. Next, volunteered phenological observations
   and daily gridded temperature data were used to validate the models.
   After that, the two most accurate models were used to evaluate the
   patterns and trends of leaf onset for the conterminous US over the
   period 2000-2014. Our results show that the RMSEs of extended spring
   indices and thermal time models are similar and about 2 days lower than
   those produced by the other models. Yet the dates of leaf out produced
   by each of the models differ by up to 11 days, and the trends differ by
   up to a week per decade. The results from the histograms and difference
   maps show that the statistical significance of these trends strongly
   depends on the type of model applied. Therefore, further work should
   focus on the development of metrics that can quantify the difference
   between patterns and trends derived from spatially explicit phenological
   models. Such metrics could subsequently be used to validate phenological
   models in both space and time. Also, such metrics could be used to
   validate phenological models in both space and time.},

Title = {An objective determination of optimal site locations for detecting
   expected trends in upper-air temperature and total column ozone},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {13},
Pages = {7653-7665},
Abstract = {Detection of climate change requires a network of stable ground-based
   long-term measurements. Building upon earlier work, we first explore
   requirements of such measurements (such as maximum random uncertainty
   and sampling frequency) to ensure a minimum random uncertainty in
   monthly mean temperatures and to ensure effective detection of trends.
   In agreement with previous work we find that only for individual
   measurement random uncertainties >0.2 K does the measurement random
   uncertainty start to contribute significantly to the random uncertainty
   in the monthly mean. For trend analysis, we find that the quality of the
   trend determination is only compromised when the measurement random
   uncertainty exceeds 2 K and measurements are made just once or twice a
   month.
   In the second part of the study we provide guidance on how to most
   effectively design a measurement network. To this end we developed a
   method to objectively identify the optimal location of sites for
   detecting projected trends in upper-air temperatures and total column
   ozone in the shortest possible time. This is done by first estimating
   the spatial distribution of the minimum length of time during which
   measurements have to be made in order to detect projected trends in
   temperature and ozone. This quantity is calculated from the unforced
   variance in the signal and the degree of autocorrelation, both estimated
   from historical data sets and assumed not to change in the future, and
   the projected trends as estimated from chemistry-climate models. The
   optimal site locations are then selected by an iterative procedure based
   on the minimum time required to detect a trend and a minimal distance
   between different measurement sites. While the optimal sites identified
   here result from our use of only one of a wide range of objective
   strategies, these results provide additional incentives for initiating
   measurement programmes at these sites or, if already in operation, to
   continue to be supported.},

Title = {High-precision analysis of binary stars with planets I. Searching for
   condensation temperature trends in the HD 106515 system},
Journal = {ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {625},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Aims. We explore for the first time the probable chemical signature of
   planet formation in the remarkable binary system HD 106515. Star A hosts
   a massive long-period planet with similar to 9 M-Jup detected by radial
   velocity, while there is no planet detected at the B star. We also
   refine stellar and planetary parameters by using non-solar-scaled
   opacities when modelling the stars.
   Methods. We carried out a simultaneous determination of stellar
   parameters and abundances by applying for the first time non-solarscaled
   opacities in this binary system, in order to reach the highest possible
   precision. We used a line-by-line strictly differential approach, using
   the Sun and then the A star as reference. Stellar parameters were
   determined by imposing an ionization and excitation balance of Fe lines,
   with an updated version of the FUNDPAR program, ATLAS12 model
   atmospheres, and the MOOG code. Opacities for an arbitrary composition
   were calculated through the opacity sampling method. The chemical
   patterns were compared with solartwins condensation temperature T-c
   trends from the literature and also mutually between both stars. We take
   the opportunity to compare and discuss the results of the classical
   solar-scaled method and the high-precision procedure applied here.
   Results. Stars A and B in the binary system HD 106515 do not seem to be
   depleted in refractory elements, which is different when comparing the
   Sun with solar twins. The terrestrial planet formation would have been
   less efficient in the stars of this binary system. Together with HD
   80606/7, this is the second binary system that does not seem to present
   a (terrestrial) signature of planet formation, when both systems host an
   eccentric giant planet. This is in agreement with numerical simulations,
   where the early dynamical evolution of eccentric giant planets clears
   out most of the possible terrestrial planets in the inner zone. We
   refined the stellar mass, radius, and age for both stars and found a
   notable difference of similar to 78\% in R-{*} compared to previous
   works. We also refined the planet mass to m(p) sin i = 9.08 +/- 0.20
   M-Jup, which differs by similar to 6\% compared with the literature. In
   addition, we showed that the non-solar-scaled solution is not compatible
   with the classical solar-scaled method, and some abundance differences
   are comparable to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) or galactic
   chemical evolution (GCE) effects especially when using the Sun as
   reference. Therefore, we encourage the use of non-solar-scaled opacities
   in high-precision studies such as the detection of T-c trends.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {60},

Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {The 1911-2010 variability in monthly runoff and the effect of 1995-2005
   summer water temperatures in a highly productive salmon system, the
   Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, Canada are explored.
   Hydrometric data from 141 FRB gauges provide variations in monthly
   runoff including their extremes and months of occurrences, as well as
   trends in their variability. Stream temperatures and their relationships
   to runoff are also assessed. There is a gradual increase of monthly
   runoff ranges from the central plateau of the FRB towards higher
   altitudes with maxima in glacier-fed alpine streams. Maximum and minimum
   monthly runoff across the FRB typically occur during May-June and
   February, respectively. There is a tendency towards greater FRB
   variability in July runoff. Water temperatures show high variability in
   the unregulated North and South Thompson rivers and low variability in
   the regulated Nechako River. FRB low flows are associated with higher
   water temperatures, while high flows are associated with cooler ones,
   both of which may have a negative impact on salmon.

Title = {Limitations and trends on cobalt-free cathode materials development for
   intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell- an updated technical
   review},
Journal = {EMERGENT MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 17},
Abstract = {Intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) work at
   moderate temperature range (600-800 degree celsius), thereby eliminating
   the issue of thermal degradation of electrode materials, reduce
   operational cost, increase flexibility of material selections, and
   enhance electrochemical stability of cell components. At
   intermediate-temperature range, there exists sluggish cathodic reaction,
   high activation energy and slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the
   cathode. Several cobalt-containing cathode perovskite materials with
   mixed ionic and electronic properties have been developed, which has
   helped in resolving sluggish ORR and enhances cathodic reaction, thereby
   increasing the overall performance of IT-SOFC. The expensive nature of
   cobalt, high evaporation rate and poor thermal expansion coefficient
   (TEC) means cobalt-free cathode materials need to be investigated. The
   present study gives an insight into the current trends of cobalt-free
   cathode materials development in IT-SOFC. Literature reviewed showed
   composite La0.65Ca0.35FeO3-delta-Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (LCF-GDC), and
   La0.7Sr0.3Cu0.15Fe0.85O3-delta cathode materials has good polarisation
   resistance of 0.28 Omega cm2 at 750 degree celsius, and 0.0153 Omega cm2
   at 700 degree celsius, respectively. Limitations, challenges, gaps were
   identified, and possible future research direction was recommended. The
   study also analysed the use of symmetrical electrodes, as it will help
   resolve the complexity of developing different electrode materials for
   cathode and anode in IT-SOFC. Holistic efforts were devoted to ensuring
   that the literature reviewed was recent (within the last 4yrs), and
   relevant to the current constraints impeding cathode materials use in
   IT-SOFC. This review study is meant to serve as a reference material to
   related researchers, and industry experts looking for the most recent
   accomplishments in cobalt-free cathode materials development.},

Title = {Surface Warming Trend Analysis Based on MODIS/Terra Land Surface
   Temperature Product at Gongga Mountain in the Southeastern Tibetan
   Plateau},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},

Abstract = {As the highest mountain in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, Gongga
   Mountain is highly sensitive to climate change which is hardly assessed
   with limited meteorological stations in this region. To analyze the
   warming trend of Gongga Mountain, the mean annual surface temperature
   (MAT) was extracted based on an annual temperature cycle model with the
   MODIS/Terra daily land surface temperature (LST) product and used to
   identify the MAT trends from 2000 to 2018 using the Mann-Kendall trend
   test. The results indicate that almost all the pixels passing a
   significance test with the confidence level of 95\% show an increasing
   trend, and the daytime MAT exhibited a stronger warming trend with the
   mean rate of 0.11 K/yr than the nighttime MAT (0.07 K/yr). However, more
   pixels (30.2\%) exhibited significant warming trends at night than
   during the daytime (21.6\%). Additionally, the significant warming
   pixels were mainly distributed above 3,200 m, and the number of pixels
   increased with elevation. Most importantly, the statistics of the
   daytime and nighttime changing rates at different elevation ranges
   support elevation-dependent warming (EDW). These warming patterns are
   connected to changes in snow and cloud cover and the rate shows good
   correlations with the changes in clear-sky days and vegetation cover
   conditions. In general, this study verifies that remotely sensed LST can
   be used to analyze the warming trends in mountain areas and identifies
   the presence of EDW at Gongga Mountain. This trend could result in a
   strong influence on the local mountain ecosystem functions, water
   resources, and glacial changes.},

Title = {Trends in daily temperature extremes over the Basilicata region

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {35},

Pages = {1964-1975},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Changes in annual and seasonal temperatures were studied from 18
   stations, distributed all over the Basilicata region (southern Italy),
   for the 1951-2010 period. The analysis is based on high-quality and
   homogenous daily minimum and maximum temperatures. Both minimum (T-min)
   and maximum (T-max) temperatures increase, especially after 1971.
   Seasonal results show upward trends in T-min in winter, spring and
   summer, whereas they show downward trends in T-min in autumn, especially
   in the last normal 1981-2010. T-max also shows upward trends in spring
   and summer, whereas it tends to decrease during winter and autumn. The
   intra-annual extreme temperature range (ETR) index also shows a general
   positive trend, especially during spring. Eleven indices were used to
   assess the changes in both the cold and warm tails of the daily
   temperature distribution. The presence of trends was assessed by means
   of the Mann-Kendall test. The results reveal a general upward tendency
   on warm days (TX90), warm nights (TN90) and tropical nights (T20)
   especially because of an increase in temperature after 1971. This datum
   is fully confirmed in summer which is the season mainly responsible for
   this trend. The annual occurrence of summer days (SU) and very warm days
   (TX99) is weakly increasing. The majority of cold extremes, i.e. very
   cold nights (TN1), cold days (TX10), cold nights (TN10), frost days (FD)
   and ice days (ID) showed negative trends, thus confirming the overall
   warming trend in the Basilicata region. This negative trend could stem
   from the strong increase of T-min during winter, spring and summer.},

Abstract = {In the backdrop of recent warmer winters over India, temperature series
   of 174 stations well distributed over the country were statistically
   analyzed to document the long term variations and trends in monthly mean
   maximum and minimum temperatures for January to March. From the trend
   analysis, February month has emerged as the warmer winter month over
   North India where increase in both maximum (+0.29 degrees C / decade)
   and minimum (+0.38 degrees C / decade) temperatures is highest with
   noteworthy increase in maximum temperature at a rate 1.5 times that of
   the South India averaged increase. Spatially, North India minimum
   temperature trends for February and March and South India maximum
   temperature trends for all months are more coherent.
   Both day-time and night-time total cloud amounts are increasing
   significantly over Indo-Gangetic plains and south peninsula and
   decreasing significantly in central and east India. However increase in
   temperatures over extreme south peninsula in January and March is
   difficult to explain on the basis of increase in day-time total cloud
   amount indicating strong influence of other climatic factors. At the
   same time, sea surface temperatures of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of
   Bengal are rising and there is strong positive correlation between land
   surface temperatures and sea surface temperatures suggesting significant
   contribution of warmer sea waters which may have important climatic
   implications over neighbouring regions.},

Abstract = {Trends and interannual variability of the surface winds (SW), sea
   surface height (SSH), and sea surface temperature (SST) of the South
   China Sea (SCS) in 1993-2003 are analyzed using monthly products from
   satellite observations. Time series are smoothed with a 12-month running
   mean filter. The east and north components of the SW, SSH, and SST have
   linear trends of 0.53 +/- 0.35 ms(-1) decade(-1), -0.04 +/- 0.17 ms(-1)
   decade(-1), 6.7 +/- 2.7 cm decade(-1), and 0.50 +/- 0.26 K decade(-1),
   respectively. The sea level rising rate and sea surface warming rate are
   significantly higher than the corresponding global rates. An Empirical
   Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis is performed to evaluate the
   interannual variability. Results show that the first EOF of the SW is
   characterized by a basin-wide anticyclonic pattern. The corresponding
   time coefficient function (TCF) correlates with the Nino3.4 index at the
   99\% confidence level, with a lag of 3 months. The first EOF of the SSH
   is characterized by a low sea level along the eastern boundary. The
   corresponding TCF correlates with the Nino3.4 at the 99\% level, with a
   lag of 2 months. The first EOF of the SST is characterized by a
   basin-wide warming with the highest anomalies in the north deep basin.
   The corresponding TCF correlates with the Nino3.4 index at the 95\%
   level, with a lag of 8 months. Based on the EOF analysis, the
   ENSO-associated correlation patterns of the SW, SSH, and SST are
   presented.},

Title = {Sampling Error of Mean and Trend of Nighttime Air Temperature at Weather
   Stations Over China Using Satellite Data as Proxy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {129},

Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Meteorological observations of surface air temperature have provided
   fundamental data for climate change detection and attribution. However,
   the weather stations are unevenly distributed, and are still very sparse
   in remote regions. The possible sampling error is well known, but not
   well quantified because we are lack of the adequate and regularly
   distributed measurements. The high resolution of satellite land surface
   temperature retrieval during night time provide a nice proxy for near
   surface temperature as both temperatures controlled by surface longwave
   radiative cooling and the nocturnal temperature inversion depress
   land-atmosphere turbulent exchange. The sampling error of mean value and
   trend were assessed by comparing station point measurements (pixel of
   similar to 0.01 degrees) with grid (1 degrees) mean and national mean
   from 2001 to 2021. This method permits us to make the first assessment
   of under-sampling error and spatial representative error on both
   national mean and trend of air temperature during nighttime collected at
   similar to 2,400 weather stations over China. The sampling error in
   national mean temperature is more than 3 degrees C. The under-sampling
   error due to lack of observation explains two thirds and the spatial
   representative error due to the difference between station and
   grid/regional mean elevation contribute the other one third. The
   sampling error in trend account for one third of the national mean
   trend. The urban heat island effect associated with urbanization around
   the weather stations (spatial representative error) can explain four
   fifths of the sampling error in trend, which is consistent with existing
   studies based on air temperature collected at paired weather station.
   Meteorological observations provide fundamental measurements of surface
   air temperature. These station-based temperature records are usually
   processed to grid data sets considering the uneven distribution of
   meteorological stations. The gridding procedure represents a
   non-uniformly sampling. In this paper, we quantified the sampling error
   over China using remote sensed temperature record as proxy of near
   surface temperature during nighttime. The causes of sampling error both
   in mean value and trend were both quantified.
   Sampling error of mean and trend of temperature collected at weather
   stations at nighttime over China were investigated The sampling error in
   national mean temperature were found to be more than 3 degrees C due to
   uneven distribution of weather stations The sampling error in
   temperature trend account for one thirds of the national mean
   temperature trend due to local urbanization},

Abstract = {The global temperature series is a major indicator of climate change,
   whereas this indicator has undergone shift in trend over the twentieth
   century, changing from linear trend to nonlinear trend as a result of
   structural breaks. This paper investigates global and regional sea
   surface (SS) and land air surface (LS) temperature series from 1880 to
   2016 by means of fractional integration technique. The results show that
   temperature series are described by trend stationary process, mostly in
   long memory range in the case of LS temperature while in the case of SS
   temperature, temperature series are in nonstationary mean reverting
   range for global and hemispheric temperature as well as for three other
   regional locations. By applying the multiple structural break test, the
   trend line is found breaking in many dates, locking up into many regimes
   which can be described using nonlinear trend structure. Nonlinear trend,
   based on Chebyshev inequality in the fractional integration framework,
   shows that global and regional temperature series can be represented
   using nonlinear trend up to the third order since this further lowers
   the integration order to long memory range in both SS and LS temperature
   series.},

Title = {Twentieth century temperature trends in CMIP3, CMIP5, and CESM-LE
   climate simulations: Spatial-temporal uncertainties, differences, and
   their potential sources},

Abstract = {The twentieth century climate simulations from the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) and Phase 5 (CMIP5) are compared
   to assess the models' ability to capture observed near-surface air
   temperature trends at global, continental, and regional scales. We
   computed trends by using a nonparametric method and considering
   long-term persistence in the time series. The role of internal
   variability is examined by using large ensemble climate simulations from
   the National Center for Atmospheric Research model Community Earth
   System Model (CESM). We computed temperature trends for three periods:
   (1) the twentieth century, (2) the second half of the twentieth century,
   and (3) the recent hiatus period to contrast the roles of external
   forcing and internal variability at various spatial and temporal scales.
   Both CMIP ensembles show statistically significant warming at global and
   continental scales during the twentieth century. We found a small but
   statistically significant difference between CMIP3 (0.57 +/- 0.07
   degrees C/century) and CMIP5 (0.47 +/- 0.06 degrees C/century) twentieth
   century temperature trends, with the CMIP3 estimate being closer to the
   observations. The spatial structure of long-term temperature trends, and
   top-of-the atmosphere net radiation trends, suggests that differences in
   model parameterizations and feedback processes that lead to a smaller
   net radiative forcing are likely contributing to the differences between
   CMIP3 and CMIP5. The estimate of internal variability based on the CESM
   large ensemble spans 24\% of the uncertainty in CMIP5 for the twentieth
   century temperature trends, and 76\% for the recent hiatus period, both
   at global scales, and 43\% and almost 100\% during the corresponding
   time periods at regional scales.},

Abstract = {The climatology and linear trend of seasonal water temperature and heat
   budget in a semienclosed sea connected to the Kuroshio region (Seto
   Inland Sea: SIS) are investigated by constructing and analyzing a
   gridded data set of water temperature, salinity, and air-sea heat
   fluxes. In the SIS, winter-time water temperature and ocean heat content
   (OHC) showed a significant increasing trend while those in summer-time
   exhibited no significant change. By analyzing the heat budget between
   the tendency of ocean heat content OHC/t and air-sea net heat flux
   Q(net), the driving factor of the winter-time warming trend in the SIS
   was identified as autumn Q(net), while the unchanged summer-time OHC is
   mainly due to decreased spring-time oceanic heat transport to the SIS
   from the Kuroshio region. In addition, we showed that the decreased
   spring-time heat transport could have been induced by upwelling due to
   wind curl and wind speed in the shelf-slope region, heat transport by
   the Kuroshio south of Shikoku Island, and freshwater input to the SIS
   from rivers. The importance of both oceanic and atmospheric forcing
   mechanisms for explaining variation in the water temperature in coastal
   areas is demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Recent increases in the awareness of sustainable green design have
   resulted in the creation of transitional spaces in high-rise buildings.
   Incorporating green design in high-rise buildings has been associated
   with the reduction of energy consumption in buildings and the provision
   of open spaces for occupants. Achieving thermal comfort in the outdoor
   environment is crucial, particularly in tropical climate settings where
   it is highly affected by microclimatic conditions such as the air
   temperature, wind, humidity and solar radiation. This paper examines the
   air temperature at three different transitional spaces of a high-rise
   office building in Penang, Malaysia. The field measurements were
   conducted in both dry and wet seasons, and the trend in the air
   temperature was assessed during these two seasons. Air temperature was
   measured using a temperature sensor and recorded with a data logger,
   BABUC-A. The findings indicated that there are significant differences
   among the three transitional spaces in both seasons. It was found that
   the different locations and the different seasons had substantial
   effects on the pattern of air temperature over time. Thus, designing
   transitional spaces specifically requires an understanding of the local
   microclimate of the area to achieve thermal comfort.},

Abstract = {Cold debris disks trace the limits of planet formation or migration in
   the outer regions of planetary systems, and thus have the potential to
   answer many of the outstanding questions in wide-orbit planet formation
   and evolution. We characterized the infrared excess spectral energy
   distributions of 174 cold debris disks around 546 main-sequence stars
   observed by both the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph and the Multiband
   Imaging Photometer for Spitzer. We found a trend between the temperature
   of the inner edges of cold debris disks and the stellar type of the
   stars they orbit. This argues against the importance of strictly
   temperature-dependent processes (e.g., non-water ice lines) in setting
   the dimensions of cold debris disks. Also, we found no evidence that
   delayed stirring causes the trend. The trend may result from outward
   planet migration that traces the extent of the primordial protoplanetary
   disk, or it may result from planet formation that halts at an orbital
   radius limited by the efficiency of core accretion.},

Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The soil surface diurnal temperature range (SSDTR), reflecting the
   synchronicity of changes in the daily extremes of soil surface
   temperatures, provides an important and sensitive indicator of climate
   change. The climatology of SSDTR and its trends have a strong connection
   with the land surface energy budget, but this has received little notice
   up to now. Our research examines the spatial-temporal characteristics of
   the annual cycle of SSDTR and its connection with other climate
   variables in China. The results demonstrate that the annual SSDTR curve
   changes gradually across space, with both regional and zonal
   characteristics. The shape of the annual SSDTR curve varies among
   regions. While it shows consistently strong positive associations with
   solar irradiance across China, a strong negative association with
   relative humidity is evident only in the dry western regions and the
   connection with relative humidity progressively decouples as we move
   toward the moist eastern regions. Atmospheric circulation affects SSDTR
   indirectly through derived changes in the seasonal cycles of moisture
   and solar irradiance. This produces a zonal character of the SSDTR
   annual curve in the east, while in the west the positive land-atmosphere
   feedback under low moisture conditions is associated with a regional
   character. The magnitude of the annual cycle of SSDTR is large compared
   with temporal change, contributing to the generally stable nature of the
   cycle under global warming conditions.},

Abstract = {Temperature anomalies have received increasing attention due to their
   potentially severe impacts on ecosystems, economy and human health. To
   facilitate objective regionalization and examine regional temperature
   anomalies, a three-stage hybrid model with stages of regionalization,
   trends and sensitivity analyses was developed. Annual mean and extreme
   temperatures were analyzed using the daily data collected from 537
   stations in China from 1966 to 2015, including the annual mean, minimum
   and maximum temperatures (Tm, TNm and TXm) as well as the extreme
   minimum and maximum temperatures (TNe and TXe). The results showed the
   following: (1) subregions with coherent temperature changes were
   identified using the rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis and
   K-means clustering algorithm. The numbers of subregions were 6, 7, 8, 9
   and 8 for Tm, TNm, TXm, The and TXe, respectively. (2) Significant
   increases in temperature were observed in most regions of China from
   1966 to 2015, although warming slowed down over the last decade. This
   warming primarily featured a remarkable increase in its minimum
   temperature. For Tm and TNm, 95\% of the stations showed a significant
   upward trend at the 99\% confidence level. TNe increased the fastest, at
   a rate of 0.56 degrees C/decade, whereas 21\% of the stations in TXe
   showed a downward trend. (3) The mean temperatures (Tm, TNm and TXm) in
   the high latitude regions increased more quickly than those in the
   low-latitude regions. The maximum temperature increased significantly at
   high elevations, whereas the minimum temperature increased greatly at
   middle-low elevations. The most pronounced warming occurred in eastern
   China in The and northwestern China in The, with mean elevations of 51 m
   and 2098 m, respectively. A cooling trend in The was observed at the
   northwestern end of China. The warming rate in TNe varied the most among
   the subregions (0.63 degrees C/decade).},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter for global climate
   change studies. LST changes are also directly associated with the
   large-scale changes in land cover. Previous studies carried out a
   comparative analysis of satellite-derived LST response between periods
   before and after homogenous land cover changes. We present an
   alternative approach that quantifies long-term LST variability in
   response to various land use/land cover change (LULCC) patterns over
   Phuket Island, Thailand, from 2003 to 2017. First, four Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) overpass times of LST time
   series were adjusted for seasonal effects using a cubic spline function
   to preserve the number of original data and enable estimates of LST
   dynamics and trends using the generalized least squared models. Second,
   LULCC patterns were classified according to land cover type conversion
   and spatial pattern transformations between the years 2000 and 2016.
   Spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity were quantified by the coverage
   percentage for each land use and land cover (LULC) type within a given
   location. Finally, the influence of LULCC patterns on the long-term
   spatiotemporal behavior of LST was assessed using the generalized
   estimating equation model. Results showed that different land cover
   transitions influence the dynamics of daytime LST but not the nighttime
   LST. The proportion of different land cover types within an LST pixel
   and transition amounts contributed to the quantity of increasing surface
   temperature, especially over impervious surface types. Diverse LULCC
   patterns with considerations of spatial heterogeneity improved our
   insight about a relatively strong effect of combined LULC types on LST
   responses. The climatic effect through the gradual conversion of
   heterogeneous land cover is necessary to be considered in climate
   research studies. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

   this paper are written to be autonomous and so can be read separately.
   Methods to define extreme events statistics and to identify and connect
   LSMPs to extreme temperature events are presented. Recent advances in
   statistical techniques connect LSMPs to extreme temperatures through
   appropriately defined covariates that supplement more straightforward
   analyses. Various LSMPs, ranging from synoptic to planetary scale
   structures, are associated with extreme temperature events. Current
   knowledge about the synoptics and the dynamical mechanisms leading to
   the associated LSMPs is incomplete. Systematic studies of: the physics
   of LSMP life cycles, comprehensive model assessment of LSMP-extreme
   temperature event linkages, and LSMP properties are needed. Generally,
   climate models capture observed properties of heat waves and cold air
   outbreaks with some fidelity. However they overestimate warm wave
   frequency and underestimate cold air outbreak frequency, and
   underestimate the collective influence of low-frequency modes on
   temperature extremes. Modeling studies have identified the impact of
   large-scale circulation anomalies and land-atmosphere interactions on
   changes in extreme temperatures. However, few studies have examined
   changes in LSMPs to more specifically understand the role of LSMPs on
   past and future extreme temperature changes. Even though LSMPs are
   resolvable by global and regional climate models, they are not
   necessarily well simulated. The paper concludes with unresolved issues
   and research questions.},

Title = {Response of the summertime ground-level ozone trend in the Chicago area
   to emission controls and temperature changes, 2005-2013},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Despite strenuous efforts to reduce the emissions of ozone precursors
   such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), concentrations of ground-level ozone
   (O-3) still often exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standard in
   U.S. cities in summertime, including Chicago. Furthermore, studies have
   projected a future increase in O-3 formation due to global climate
   change. This study examines the response of summertime O-3 to emission
   controls and temperature change in the Chicago area from 2005 to 2013 by
   employing observations of O-3, O-3 precursors, and meteorological
   variables. We find that meteorology explains about 53\% of the O-3
   variance in Chicago. O-3 mixing ratios over Chicago are found to show no
   clear decline over the 2005-2013 period. The summertime ground-level O-3
   trend consists of a decrease of 0.08 ppb/year between 2005 and 2009 and
   an increase of 1.49 ppb/year between 2009 and 2013. Emissions of NOx and
   concentrations of NO2 have been decreasing steadily from 2005 to 2013 in
   the Chicago area. Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in
   Chicago, however, have more than doubled since 2009, even though
   emission inventories suggest that VOC emissions have decreased. We
   believe that O-3 production in Chicago became more sensitive to VOCs
   starting in 2008/2009 and may have switched from being NOx-limited to
   VOC-limited. The warmer climate since 2008 has also contributed to the
   increasing ozone trend in the Chicago area. Increased attention should
   be paid to improving the quantification of VOC sources, enhancing the
   monitoring of reactive VOC concentrations, and designing VOC mitigation
   measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present paper is a preliminary study of the long term temperature
   trends in the eastern Mediterranean area. The air temperature time
   series of the following stations were investigated: Cairo, Alexandria,
   Jerusalem, Beirut, Nicosia, Athens, Kerkyra, Catania and Rome. For this
   group of stations the air temperature trends for about the last 100
   years are examined and are compared with the corresponding time series
   of the land surface air temperature, the sea surface temperature (SST)
   and the  marine air temperature (NMAT) for the northern hemisphere (NH).
   A better agreement was found between the time series of the eastern
   Mediterranean region and the SSTs and NMATs, than with the NH air
   temperature (land surface). The coincidence of the 1900s minimum of
   eastern Mediaterranean air temperature and the SSTs and NMATs especially
   merits further investigation.},

Abstract = {Contributions of the anthropogenic influence characterized by variations
   in the atmospheric greenhouse gas radiative forcing and of the key modes
   of natural climate variability to the trends of surface air temperatures
   at different latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere on different temporal
   horizons are quantified from observations. The role of the Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation, El Nino/Southern Oscillation, Interdecadal
   Pacific Oscillation, and Antarctic Oscillation in driving these
   temperature trends is estimated using trivariate autoregressive models
   and data since the 19th century. We note the substantial contributions
   of the key modes of natural climate variability to temperature trends on
   rather short intervals of about two or three decades, which is
   comparable to or even greater than the contribution of greenhouse gases.
   The estimates characterizing polar, middle, and tropical latitudes of
   the Southern Hemisphere are compared with those obtained for the
   Northern Hemisphere. According to these estimates, a dominant
   contribution to temperature trends at different latitudes and for the
   Earth as a whole on the intervals of about half a century and longer is
   made by the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Mean radiant temperature (MRT) is one of the six primary factors that
   determine thermal comfort in a given thermal environment. In this study,
   the average radiant temperature was determined using a calculation
   method based on the surrounding surface temperatures and view factors.
   The present study specifically investigated the use of calculated
   radiant temperature, compared to measured radiant temperature, for
   predicting the mean vote (PMV) and percentage of dissatisfied (PPD)
   comfort parameters. The method was validated by the experimental
   measurements via the black sphere thermometer at five different
   reference points in a test room, including radiant panels on the ceiling
   and walls. By using global thermometer measurements, the proposed
   approach achieved a high degree of compatibility and an accuracy of 0.17
   degrees C, which was the difference between calculated and measured
   values. The results demonstrated the reliability of the procedure using
   view factors and surrounding surface temperatures to calculate the
   radiant temperature in the designated test room; here, a straightforward
   method for evaluating the thermal conditions of an office room and
   determining the optimal location of an air temperature sensor in
   PMV-controlled radiant systems was also proposed. This study contributes
   to the increasing field of research on thermal comfort and offers
   knowledge that is beneficial for the design and optimization of indoor
   environments.},

Abstract = {Changes in global temperature have adverse influences on the
   environment, crop production, and public health. Temperature extreme
   investigation is necessary for those areas whose cropland and work
   cultures rely on effective climatic conditions. Therefore, identifying
   trends in climatic scenarios is important in determining the pattern of
   extreme temperatures. The previously mentioned trend analysis was based
   on a complete period that did not investigate the recent variability in
   temperature. We scrutinized a different decadal zone using the
   innovative trend analysis method (ITAM). We selected the annual and
   seasonal extreme temperature variations for 70 years (1951-2020) at 11
   grid points in the Kangsabati-Silabati-Keliaghai-Dwarkeswar basins of
   West Bengal. The outcomes from two different time zones, 1951-2020 and
   2001-2020, show some surprising results. For 1951-2020, Tmax shows
   negative sloping patterns in winter and summer, whereas for 2001-2020,
   it shows the opposite pattern: year-round, winter and summer with
   excessive magnitudes. Similarly, for Tmin, all the seasons from 1951 to
   2020 show positive trends, but in recent decades (2001-2020), except the
   monsoon season, other seasons show negative trends. The normalized
   difference in vegetation and water indices also supports the results of
   trends. From the results obtained through the use of ITAM, we recognize
   that the results of the recent trends are more sensitive and of a higher
   magnitude of slope in nature than in the historical decade. This study
   may serve as scientific support for detecting and strategically
   minimizing the effects of climate change on water resources to reduce
   the risk of adverse weather soon.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the influences of internal climate variability
   (ICV) on Eurasian spring (March-May) surface air temperature (SAT)
   trends based on a 30-member ensemble of the Community Earth System Model
   version 1 (CESM1) from 1979 to 2014. The SAT trends over the mid-high
   latitude Eurasia vary considerably among individual simulations,
   indicating a large impact of ICV on SAT trends at regional scales. The
   leading pattern of internally generated SAT trend variability over
   Eurasia among the 30 SAT trends displays same sign distribution over the
   mid-high latitudes of Eurasia. This pattern is associated with the
   Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) that accounts for about 1/3 of
   total variance of the spring sea level pressure (SLP) trends. The second
   pattern of internally generated SAT trend variability features a dipole
   structure, accompanied by prominent circulation changes over the North
   Atlantic and Europe. Internal dynamics account for approximately 40-70\%
   of the observed warming over the central Eurasia and the Russian Far
   East. A dynamical adjustment methodology is employed to remove the
   effects of internal atmospheric circulation variability. Dynamical
   adjustment greatly reduces the spread of SAT trends within the ensemble
   and brings both the simulated and observed trends closer to the ensemble
   mean. Changes in the Barents-Kara Sea ice and Eurasian snow cover
   contribute to the remaining spread in SAT trends over the north coast of
   Russia and in the region north of the Caspian Sea, respectively. Both
   dynamics and thermodynamics contribute to the Barents-Kara Sea ice and
   Eurasian snow cover trends.},

Abstract = {In this study, we analysed the interannual variability of sea surface
   temperature (SST), sea surface wind (SSW), and sea level anomaly (SLA)
   in the South China Sea (SCS) during 1985-2016 using monthly reanalysis
   and satellite datasets. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis
   was performed to evaluate the interannual variability of each variable.
   The warming rate of SST was 0.18 +/- 0.26 degrees C decade(-1) in the
   SCS. The first EOF of SST was characterized by basin-wide warming, with
   the highest anomalies in the northern deep basin. The first temporal
   coefficient of SST was negatively correlated with the Nino 3.4 index,
   with a lag of 6 mo. The mean rising rate of SLA was 7.6 cm decade(-1),
   with the greatest trend in the coastal water of Vietnam, which exhibited
   a similar spatial pattern with the first EOF of SLA. The temporal
   coefficient of SLA was negatively correlated with that of SST, with a
   lag of 5 mo. The trend of SSW was around 0.8 m s(-1) decade(-1) over the
   SCS. The first EOF of SSW was characterized by an anticyclonic pattern.
   The temporal coefficient was correlated with that of SST, with a lead of
   2 mo. Wavelet coherence was used to investigate the cross-correlation
   relationship between SST and other variables. SST and SLA had a strong
   negative correlation in the 8-16-mo (1-1.5 yr) band. The high positive
   wavelet coherencies between SST and SSW and Nino 3.4 were mainly in the
   32-64 mo (3-5 yr) band in the SCS.},

Title = {Temporal- and Spatial-Scale Dependence of Three CMIP3 Climate Models in

Abstract = {Motivated by increasing interests in regional- and decadal-scale climate
   predictions, this study systematically analyzed the spatial-and
   temporal-scale dependence of the prediction skill of global climate
   models in surface air temperature (SAT) change in the twentieth century.
   The linear trends of annual mean SAT over moving time windows (running
   linear trends) from two observational datasets and simulations by three
   global climate models {[}Community Climate System Model, version 3.0
   (CCSM3.0), Climate Model, version 2.0 (CM2.0), and Model E-H] that
   participated in CMIP3 are compared over several temporal (10-, 20-, 30-,
   40-, and 50-yr trends) and spatial (5 degrees x 5 degrees, 10 degrees x
   10 degrees, 15 degrees x 15 degrees, 20 degrees x 20 degrees, 30 degrees
   x 30 degrees, 30 degrees latitudinal bands, hemispheric, and global)
   scales. The distribution of root-mean-square error is improved with
   increasing spatial and temporal scales, approaching the observational
   uncertainty range at the largest scales. Linear correlation shows a
   similar tendency, but the limited observational length does not provide
   statistical significance over the longer temporal scales. The comparison
   of RMSE to climatology and a Monte Carlo test using preindustrial
   control simulations suggest that the multimodel ensemble mean is able to
   reproduce robust climate signals at 30 degrees zonal mean or larger
   spatial scales, while correlation requires hemispherical or global mean
   for the twentieth-century simulations. Persistent lower performance is
   observed over the northern high latitudes and the North Atlantic
   southeast of Greenland. Although several caveats exist for the metrics
   used in this study, the analyses across scales and/or over running time
   windows can be taken as one of the approaches for climate system model
   evaluations.},

Abstract = {Long-term data series of ice cover on lakes and river temperatures from

   last four decades of ice data from the subalpine lake, vre Heimdalsvatn,

   are compared to water temperature data from three neighbouring, quite
   different locations, the glacier-fed rivers LeirungsAyeni and Sjoa, and
   the alpine lake, Bessvatn. The study also examines the air
   temperature/river temperature relationships, and the air temperature/ice
   freeze-up and break-up dates. During the months of July, August and
   September, the water temperature in Hinogla was well correlated to the
   air temperature, but the correlation was poor in the remaining months
   due to the ice cover and snow conditions. A significant temperature
   increase of 2-3A degrees C has been observed in Hinogla in the months
   August-October since 1984. There were only minor changes in the duration
   of the ice cover season during the last 40 years, but a delay of 9 days
   was found in the freeze-up date and a delay of 6 days in the break-up
   date, although the latter was not significant.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Previous research has illustrated differences in temperature trends as
   measured by high elevation surface stations versus free-air temperatures
   interpolated to the same locations from the National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric
   Research's (NCAR) Re-analysis R1. This paper examines the extent to
   which the decision to use RI rather than radiosonde data influenced
   these results. Temperatures at selected high elevation surface sites
   (1948-1998) are paired with nearby homogeneity adjusted radiosonde data
   from Lanzante, Klein and Seidel (LKS). For each station pair, four mean
   monthly temperature anomaly time series are examined, consisting of (1)
   surface Global Historical Climate Network (GHCNv2)/Climate Research Unit
   (CRUv2) station anomalies (SF), (2) LKS radiosonde anomalies, and R1
   anomalies interpolated to (3) the surface (RNSF) and (4) radiosonde
   (RNLKS) locations respectively. Analyses demonstrate the extent of
   common variance, the mean climatology of each of the four series, and
   differences or similarities in trends. The surface record is decoupled
   from the other three series especially in locations of incised
   topography. In 15 out of 18 pairs RNSF shows greater affinity with LKS
   than with SF and there is a high degree of common variance between LKS
   and RNSF. There is a high degree of correlation between secular trends
   in the two R1 series, both of which are much more similar to radiosonde
   than to surface trends. Trends in raw temperature and in AT (the
   surface/free-air temperature difference) both therefore show limited
   sensitivity to the choice of LKS radiosonde versus R1 (RNSF), apart from
   in a few locations in the Eurasian continent. Copyright (C) 2007 Royal

Title = {Long-Term Trends and Interannual Variability of Wind Forcing, Surface
   Circulation, and Temperature around the Sub-Antarctic Prince Edward
   Islands},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {In the Southern Ocean, the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs)
   play a significant ecological role by hosting large populations of
   seasonally breeding marine mammals and seabirds, which are particularly
   sensitive to changes in the surrounding ocean environment. In order to
   better understand climate variability at the PEIs, this study used
   satellite and reanalysis data to examine the interannual variability and
   longer-term trends of Sea Surface Temperature (SST), wind forcing, and
   surface circulation. Long-term trends were mostly weak and statistically
   insignificant, possibly due to the restricted length of the data
   products. While seasonal fluctuations accounted for a substantial
   portion (50-70\%) of SST variability, the strongest variance in wind
   speed, wind stress curl (WSC), and currents occurred at intra-annual
   time scales. At a period of about 1 year, SST and geostrophic current
   variability suggested some influence of the Southern Annular Mode, but
   correlations were weak and insignificant. Similarly, correlations with
   El Nino Southern Oscillation variability were also weak and mostly
   insignificant, probably due to strong local and regional modification of
   SST, wind, and current anomalies. Significant interannual and
   decadal-scale variability in SST, WSC, and geostrophic currents,
   strongest at periods of 3-4 and 7-8 years, corresponded with the
   variability of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. At decadal time scales,
   there was a strong inverse relationship between SST and geostrophic
   currents and between SST and wind speed. Warmer-than-usual SST between
   1990-2001 and 2009-2020 was related to weaker currents and wind, while
   cooler-than-usual periods during 1982-1990 and 2001-2009 were associated
   with relatively stronger winds and currents. Positioned directly in the
   path of passing atmospheric low-pressure systems and the Antarctic

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal trends of remotely sensed sea-ice cover, sea
   surface temperatures, chlorophyll-a concentration and primary production
   in the Baffin Bay, Davis Strait and Labrador Sea were analyzed for the
   1998-2017 period. We found spatial variability in the trends of these
   cryospheric, biologic and oceanographic phenomena. For example, in the
   northern Baffin Bay, we observed decreases in annual sea-ice
   persistence, yet increases along the Labrador Sea-ice edge during
   winter, with the latter having significant correlations with broader
   atmospheric patterns. In general, we observed increases in summer sea
   surface temperatures across the study region, except a small area of
   cooling along the southern Greenlandic coast. We also found significant
   negative trends in April chlorophyll-a and primary production followed
   by significant positive trends for both biological phenomena in May,
   owing to anomalously high values in 2014 and 2015. Notably, we found a
   significant positive correlation between days of monthly sea ice
   presence in April with May primary production quantities. Finally, we
   found a significant positive trend in total annual primary production
   over the study period. This novel finding suggests an important
   relationship between the timing of breakup along the sea-ice edge and
   peaks in biological production.},

Abstract = {A coastal ocean climatology of temperature and salinity in the Southern
   California Bight is estimated from conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD)
   and bottle sample profiles collected by historical California
   Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI) cruises
   (1950-2009; quarterly after 1984) off southern California and
   quarterly/monthly nearshore CTD surveys (within 30 km from the coast
   except for the surfzone; 1999-2009) off San Diego and Los Angeles. As
   these fields are sampled regularly in space, but not in time,
   conventional Fourier analysis may not be possible. The time dependent
   temperature and salinity fields are modeled as linear combinations of an
   annual cycle and its five harmonics, as well as three standard climate
   indices (El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)), the Scripps
   Pier temperature time series, and a mean and linear trend without time
   lags. Since several of the predictor indices are correlated, the indices
   are successively orthogonalized to eliminate ambiguity in the
   identification of the contributed variance of each component. Regression
   coefficients are displayed in both vertical transects and horizontal
   maps to evaluate (1) whether the temporal and spatial scales of the two
   data sets of nearshore and offshore observations are consistent and (2)
   how oceanic variability at a regional scale is related to variability in
   the nearshore waters. The data-derived climatology can be used to
   identify anomalous events and atypical behaviors in regional-scale
   oceanic variability and to provide background ocean estimates for
   mapping or modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The contrasting trend of global urbanization-induced impacts on day and
   night land surface temperature from a time-series perspective},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Understanding the warming effect of the impervious surface area (ISA)
   quantitively is crucial to alleviate the urban heat island effect.
   However, the quantitative analyses of urbanization-induced land surface
   temperature (LST) change globally remain to be determined during the
   global warming hiatus. Here, we first characterized the response of LST
   to ISA (i.e., delta LST) in 369 global cities using MODIS LST product (1
   km) and the global artificial impervious area dataset (30 m). We then
   investigated the spatiotemporal changes of delta LST and its associated
   driving factors, including enhanced vegetation index (1 km), albedo
   (ALB, 500 m), population (100 m), air temperature (AT, 0.1 degrees), and
   precipitation (0.1 degrees). The analysis was conducted using linear
   regression models from 2000 to 2010 at the pixel level. The results
   illustrate that (1) the daytime delta LST in urban areas shows a
   negative trend with -0.2971 degrees C/\% and -0.0870 degrees C/\% in
   arid and temperate regions, and the nighttime delta LSTs were 0.0938
   degrees C/\% and 0.0048 degrees C/\%, respectively. In tropical regions,
   the delta LST remains positive throughout the day, while it exhibits an
   opposite trend in snow regions. (2) The magnitude of nighttime delta LST
   is stronger compared to daytime globally, which is more significant in
   arid regions with the largest Delta delta LST values (i.e., diurnal
   variations) in urban (0.3909 degrees C/\%) and rural (0.3262 degrees
   C/\%) areas. (3) In temperate regions, the response of ALB to ISA (delta
   ALB, negative effect) and the response of AT to ISA (delta AT, positive
   effect) are dominant factors in regulating delta LST during daytime and
   nighttime, respectively However, in arid regions, the daytime and
   nighttime delta LSTs are negatively correlated by urban population and
   vegetation, respectively. These findings provide a quantitative
   understanding on long-term LST variations and driving factors behind at
   the pixel level, suggesting that urban greening and increasing surface
   albedo are effective strategies to mitigate the urbanization-induced
   surface warming.},

   Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Abstract = {The temperature of the stratosphere has decreased over the past several
   decades. Two causes contribute to that decrease: well-mixed greenhouse
   gases (GHGs) and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). This paper addresses
   the attribution of temperature decreases to these two causes and the
   implications of that attribution for the future evolution of
   stratospheric temperature. Time series analysis is applied to
   simulations of the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate
   Model (GEOS CCM) to separate the contributions of GHGs from those of
   ODSs based on their different time-dependent signatures. The analysis
   indicates that about 60\%-70\% of the temperature decrease of the past
   two decades in the upper stratosphere near 1 hPa and in the lower
   midlatitude stratosphere near 50 hPa resulted from changes attributable
   to ODSs, primarily through their impact on ozone. As ozone recovers over
   the next several decades, the temperature should continue to decrease in
   the middle and upper stratosphere because of GHG increases. The time
   series of observed temperature in the upper stratosphere is approaching
   the length needed to separate the effects of ozone-depleting substances
   from those of greenhouse gases using temperature time series data.},

Title = {Climate change-induced urban heat Island trend projection and land
   surface temperature: A case study of Thailand?s Bangkok metropolitan},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This research projects future climate change-induced urban heat island
   (UHI) trends (2022-2099) using three dynamically downscaled regional
   climate models (RCM1 - RCM3) under two repre-sentative concentration
   pathways: RCP4.5 and 8.5. RCP 4.5 is a moderate scenario in which
   emissions peak around 2040 and then decline, while RCP 8.5 is the
   highest baseline emissions scenario in which emissions continue to rise
   throughout the twenty-first century. An RCM is a numerical climate
   prediction model forced by specified lateral and ocean conditions from
   observation-based dataset that simulates atmospheric and land surface
   processes. In the study, the RCMs are based on three respective global
   climate models: ICHEC-EC-EARTH, MPI-M-MPI-ESM-MR and
   NOAA-GFDL-GFDL-ESM2M. The study area is Thailand's capital Bangkok, and
   the UHI trends are determined by the Mann-Kendall trends and Sen's slope
   estimates of 13 future temperature-based extreme climate indexes,
   consisting of nine warm extreme indexes and four cold extreme indexes.
   The findings reveal that the majority of the warm extreme indexes are
   trending upward, while most of the cold indexes exhibit a downward
   trend. In essence, the Bangkok metropolitan area highly likely
   experiences warmer temperatures in the future, contributing to higher
   land surface temperature and UHI intensity.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to estimate the trend in extreme temperature
   events in the northern part of Korean Peninsula during 1960-2019, as
   well as to conduct a comparison experiment with the other representative
   results, all trends are examined based on quality-controlled daily
   maximum and minimum temperature data from 37 weather stations. Results
   are as follows. First, frost days (FD0) and ice days (ID0) showed a
   clear downward trend, whereas warm days (SU25) and warm nights (TR20)
   experienced an obvious uptrend, with SU25 exceeding TR20, while very hot
   days (TX35), extreme hot days (TX37) and very extreme hot days (TX39)
   showed abrupt increasing trends, especially twice in TX37 and six times
   in TX39, respectively. Both of cold nights (TN10) and cold days (TX10)
   decreased by about -0.7d/decade, hot nights (TN90) and hot days (TX90)
   increased by 0.6d and 1.0d/decade, respectively. Second, as compared
   with to representative results in global by the relevant reference and
   study period, all uptrends in TR20, SU25 and annual maximum of daily
   maximum temperature (TXx) were significantly higher than those in most
   regions in China, SU25 and TR20 were mostly greater than those in most
   regions, except for some regions in Europe. In particular, TR20 upward
   trend exceeded any other region's results. Meanwhile, TX10 and TNn
   experienced stronger downward and upward tendencies than those in whole
   China respectively. Especially, TNn experienced the strongest upward
   trend in comparing with the others. Overall, results revealed hot
   weather frequency and nighttime warm events over the study area have
   experienced a larger increasing trend than those in global land.},

Title = {Forced and Internal Components of Winter Air Temperature Trends over
   North America during the past 50 Years: Mechanisms and Implications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2237-2258},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study elucidates the physical mechanisms underlying internal and
   forced components of winter surface air temperature (SAT) trends over
   North America during the past 50 years (1963-2012) using a combined
   observational and modeling framework. The modeling framework consists of
   30 simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) at 1 degrees
   latitude-longitude resolution, each of which is subject to an identical
   scenario of historical radiative forcing but starts from a slightly
   different atmospheric state. Hence, any spread within the ensemble
   results from unpredictable internal variability superimposed upon the
   forced climate change signal. Constructed atmospheric circulation
   analogs are used to estimate the dynamical contribution to forced and
   internal components of SAT trends: thermodynamic contributions are
   obtained as a residual. Internal circulation trends are estimated to
   account for approximately one-third of the observed wintertime warming
   trend over North America and more than half locally over parts of Canada
   and the United States. Removing the effects of internal atmospheric
   circulation variability narrows the spread of SAT trends within the CESM
   ensemble and brings the observed trends closer to the model's
   radiatively forced response. In addition, removing internal dynamics
   approximately doubles the signal-to-noise ratio of the simulated SAT
   trends and substantially advances the ``time of emergence'' of the
   forced component of SAT anomalies. The methodological framework proposed
   here provides a general template for improving physical understanding
   and interpretation of observed and simulated climate trends worldwide
   and may help to reconcile the diversity of SAT trends across the models
   from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).},

Abstract = {The sea surface temperature (SST) in loggerhead turtle breeding areas
   affects the species reproductive biology. Less is known about the
   effects of changes in SST in the species foraging grounds. We used
   nesting data for the Mediterranean loggerhead turtle population breeding
   on the Greek island of Zakynthos to study the effect of SST in the
   population foraging grounds upon the initiation of nesting and the
   number of clutches laid. We found that the climatic conditions (SST) in
   the foraging grounds affected the population nesting phenology in the
   short term (i.e. within the same year); warmer years triggered an
   earlier onset of nesting. However, the effect of foraging grounds SST
   upon nesting is comparatively less important than the local conditions
   at the nesting ground. Although nesting phenology seems to depend on
   current's year foraging grounds SST the number of nests in our study
   rookery were negatively correlated with SSTs recorded 2 years prior
   nesting, with higher SST leading to fewer nests. From this point of
   view, climate change at the foraging grounds may influence the
   reproductive phenology of loggerheads. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {We use Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model simulations made under
   various climate change scenarios to study the evolution of the
   global-mean temperature trend in the late twentieth century and the
   twenty-first century. Results are compared with available satellite
   observations, including new trend estimates derived from the Sounding of
   the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument on NASA's
   TIMED spacecraft. Modeled and observed trends are shown to be consistent
   throughout the entire middle atmosphere, from near the tropopause
   (similar to 16 km) to the lower thermosphere (similar to 95 km) in the
   period covered by the satellite data. Simulations are extended into the
   twenty-first century to document the evolution of the global-mean
   temperature trend profile. We find, consistent with previous studies, a
   marked change in the trend profile at the turn of the twenty-first
   century, which is driven by the recovery of stratospheric ozone
   following the adoption of the Montreal Protocol. In the twenty-first
   century, the trend profile becomes more uniform with altitude, but its
   overall shape and magnitude are conditioned by the scenario adopted for
   future emissions of greenhouse gases. Our results suggest that the
   vertical profile of temperature trends in the middle atmosphere will
   remain an important signature of global climate change, and they
   underscore the importance of global, continuous monitoring of this
   region of the atmosphere.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Variability and Trends in Extreme Temperature Events in
   Finland over the Recent Decades: Influence of Northern Hemisphere
   Teleconnection Patterns},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {Fifteen temperature indices recommended by the ETCCDI (Expert Team on
   Climate Change Detection and Indices) were applied to evaluate
   spatiotemporal variability and trends in annual intensity, frequency,
   and duration of extreme temperature statistics in Finland during
   1961-2011. Statistically significant relationships between these
   high-resolution (10 km) temperature indices and seven influential
   Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns (NHTPs) for the interannual
   climate variability were also identified. During the study period
   (1961-2011), warming trends in extreme temperatures were generally
   manifested by statistically significant increases in cold temperature
   extremes rather than in the warm temperature extremes. As expected, warm
   days and nights became more frequent, while fewer cold days and nights
   occurred. The frequency of frost and icing days also decreased. Finland
   experienced more (less) frequent warm (cold) temperature extremes over
   the past few decades. Interestingly, significant lengthening in cold
   spells was observed over the upper part of northern Finland, while no
   clear changes are found in warm spells. Interannual variations in the
   temperature indices were significantly associated with a number of
   NHTPs. In general, warm temperature extremes show significant
   correlations with the East Atlantic and the Scandinavia patterns and
   cold temperature extremes with the Arctic Oscillation and the North
   Atlantic Oscillation patterns.},

Abstract = {Long-term (1981-2014) trends in soil temperatures at depths ranging from
   0-320 cm were used to examine relationships between regional climate
   change and soil temperatures in the Three River Source Region (TRSR) of
   the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Air temperature, precipitation, maximum depth
   of frozen ground and maximum snow depth were also analysed for trends
   and for correlations with soil temperatures. A significant warming trend
   was evident in the TRSR during the 35 yr analysed. Significant soil
   warming was detected, at rates of 0.706 degrees C decade(-1) for surface
   soils (0 cm), 0.477 degrees C decade(-1) for shallow layer soils (5-20
   cm) and 0.417 degrees C decade(-1) for deep layer soils (40-320 cm).
   There was a clear effect of air temperature on soil temperature, as seen
   from the concurrent significant increases in air and soil temperature
   trends and the strong cor relation between them. The relationship
   between precipitation and soil temperatures was com plicated. Higher
   levels of precipitation on the ground also resulted in higher soil
   temperatures during the summer in the frozen soil, while the process of
   freezing and thawing had an inhibitory effect on the soil temperature
   increase. The warming trends in soil temperature are expected to
   continue with the degradation of frozen soil in the TRSR.},

Abstract = {In this study, we demonstrate remarkable warming trends in northern
   winter and spring not only at the surface but also in the lower
   troposphere during a recent 30 year period (1964-93). In winter, major
   warming has happened over central Siberia and the northwestern
   Canada/Alaska region. The vertical structure of the warming tendency is
   somewhat different between these two regions. In spring, tropospheric
   warming is most noticeable over the northern part of North America. A
   three-dimensional rotated EOF analysis of the temperature anomaly field
   in these seasons confirmed the warming trends as the most dominant mode
   at the surface and in the lower troposphere.
   The rotated EOF analysis also shows that an interdecadal-scale
   fluctuation with abrupt changes in the periods of 1976/77 and 1988/89 is
   another dominant mode in the temperature field in winter. The spatial
   structure of this mode shows a wavenumber-three spatial pattern with
   positive factorloadings over North America, Northern Europe and the
   eastern part of Eurasia. In spring, a fluctuation of 10-13 year period
   is noticed in the second largest mode, which suggests a possible
   relation with the solar cyle of the same period. Possible forcing
   factors of these tropospheric temperature trends and fluctuations are
   briefly discussed.},

   over the Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Region (1960-2014), China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {In order to examine temperature changes and extremes in the
   Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Region (BTSSR), ten extreme temperature
   indices were selected, categorized, and calculated spanning the period
   1960-2014, and the spatiotemporal variability and trends of temperature
   and extremes on multitimescales in the BTSSR were investigated using the
   Mann-Kendall (M-K) test, Sen's slope estimator, and linear regression.
   Results show that mean temperatures have increased and extreme
   temperature events have become more frequent. Annual temperature has
   recorded a significant increasing trend over the BTSSR, in which 51
   stations exhibited significant increasing trends (p < 0.05); winter
   temperature recorded the most significant increasing trend in the
   northwest subregion. All extreme temperature indices showed warming
   trends at most stations; a higher warming slope in extreme temperature
   mainly occurred along the northeast border and northwest border and in
   the central-southern mountain area. As extreme low temperature events
   decrease, vegetation damage due to freezing temperatures will reduce and
   low cold-tolerant plants may expand their distribution range northward
   to revegetate barren areas in the BTSSR. However, in water-limited areas
   of the BTSSR, increasing temperatures in the growing season may
   exacerbate stress associated with plants relying on precipitation due to
   higher temperatures combining with decreasing precipitation.},

Title = {Temporal trends and spatial patterns in the temperature and oxygen
   regimes in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, 1972-2008},
Journal = {AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {9-20},
Abstract = {The temperature and oxygen regimes of the Bay of Quinte have been
   monitored, weekly or biweekly, in the open water season at a series of
   offshore index sites since 1972. Since 2001, temperature has been
   monitored in situ using loggers at both offshore and nearshore sites.
   This study was undertaken to assess the potential role of morphometry,
   climate, nutrient loading, and invasion by dreissenids in temporal
   trends and spatial patterns of temperature and oxygen regimes. The
   thermal regime was assessed using summer surface temperatures, Schmidt's
   vertical stability values, and vertical stratification characteristics.
   When the Quinte studies began taking measurements in the hypolimnion,
   deeper stations were attaining low oxygen levels by the end of summer,
   raising concerns that the cumulative impacts of eutrophication might
   lead to anoxia. The bottom oxygen regime at sites that stratified was
   assessed using the hypolimnetic warming rates and the apparent oxygen
   depletion rates one meter off the bottom. Quinte's maximum summer
   surface waters have warmed almost 1 degrees C from 1972 to 2008 in line
   with climate warming. Nearshore sites in the shallow upper Bay have
   similar temperatures to offshore index sites while those in the lower
   Bay are warmer. The warming of surface waters has increased the maximum
   Schmidt's stability values at the deeper sites but thermocline depth or
   bottom temperatures have not changed. Hypolimnetic warming rates showed
   no temporal change but were inversely correlated with mean summer flow
   from the main river draining into the Bay. Oxygen depletion was variable
   but exhibited a downward trend in response to reduced phosphorus loading
   with neither climate warming nor the driessenid invasion having a
   detectable effect. Projected 21st C climate warming poses a threat to
   the Bay of Quinte ecosystem.},

Abstract = {This study examines trends in minimum and maximum temperatures at
   various climate stations located in different regions of Morocco for a
   period of five decades (1970 to 2019). Mann-Kendall, Sen's estimator,
   Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) and Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis
   (IPTA) were used in the analysis. The results show significant
   fluctuations, at different time scales, between minimum and maximum
   temperatures at all stations. In coastal areas, such as Rabat Sale,
   minimum temperatures fell during January and February while other months
   saw increases. Average minimum temperatures in Rabat Sale tend to fall
   by 0.5 degree celsius. On the other hand, maximum temperatures in Rabat
   Sale rose by 0.2 degrees C. A decrease of 0.4 degree celsius for T-min
   and 1.6 degree celsius for T-max were observed in higher continental
   regions, such as Meknes. Other stations, such as Fez Sais (0.6 degree
   celsius T-min and 2.6 degree celsius T-max) and Taza (1.1 degree celsius
   T-min and 2.6 degree celsius T-max) showed an upward trend. Trends also
   vary, with notable increases in minimum and maximum temperatures,
   indicating different climatic dynamics according to altitude and
   locality. In particular, the ITA highlights a significant increase in
   annual maximum temperatures, with a P-value < 0.05 and trend slopes
   ranging from 0.0015 degree celsius per year in Rabat Sale to 0.0076
   degree celsius per year in Taza. In addition, the IPTA results confirm
   diversity of upward and downward trends on monthly and seasonal scales,
   highlighting impact of geographical factors such as proximity to sea,
   topography, and continentality that contribute to formation of regional
   microclimates. The results highlight significant impact of climate
   change in Morocco.},

Abstract = {Microwave temperature sounding observations from polar-orbiting
   meteorological satellites have been widely used for research on climate
   trends of atmospheric temperature at different heights around the world.
   Taking the Amazon rainforest as the target area, this study combined the
   Microwave Temperature Sounder-2 (MWTS-2) data onboard the Chinese
   FengYun-3D (FY-3D) satellite with the Advanced Microwave Sounding unit-A
   (AMSU-A) data onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) and the European Meteorological Operational
   (MetOp) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites (i.e., NOAA-15, -18,
   -19, MetOp-A, -B). The double difference method was used to estimate and
   thus eliminate the inter-sensor bias, and a decadal diurnal correction
   was used to reduce the impact of different local equator crossing times
   on climate trends. The ``no-rain{''} conditions were determined for
   AMSU-A data by channels 1 and 15, and for MWTS-2 data by channels 1 and
   7. Finally, the decadal linear trends of atmospheric temperature from
   1998 to 2020 were obtained after applying the inter-sensor bias
   calibration and inter-decadal diurnal correction to AMSU-A and MWTS-2
   data from NOAA-15, -18, -19; MetOp-A, -B; and FY-3D. A warming trend was
   found in the AMSU-A window and tropospheric channels (1-9 and 15) and a
   cooling trend in stratospheric channels (10-14). The warming (cooling)
   trends of channels 7-9 (10) were relatively small. The warming (cooling)
   trends of AMSU-A channels 1-6 (14-15) were significantly reduced after
   the inter-decadal diurnal correction.},

Title = {Trends in temperature-related age-specific and sex-specific mortality
   from cardiovascular diseases in Spain: a national time-series analysis},
Journal = {LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},

Abstract = {Background Climate change driven by human activities has increased
   annual temperatures in Spain by around 1 degrees C since 1980. However,
   little is known regarding the extent to which the association between
   temperature and mortality has changed among the most susceptible
   population groups as a result of the rapidly warming climate. We aimed
   to assess trends in temperature-related cardiovascular disease mortality
   in Spain by sex and age, and we investigated the association between
   climate warming and changes in the risk of mortality.
   Methods We did a country-wide time-series analysis of 48 provinces in
   mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31,
   2016. We extracted daily cardiovascular disease mortality data
   disaggregated by sex, age, and province from the Spanish National
   Institute of Statistics database. We also extracted daily mean
   temperatures from the European Climate Assessment and Dataset project.
   We applied a quasi-Poisson regression model for each province,
   controlling for seasonal and long-term trends, to estimate the temporal
   changes in the province-specific temperature-mortality associations with
   distributed lag non-linear models. We did a multivariate random-effects
   meta-analysis to derive the best linear unbiased prediction of the
   temperature-mortality association and the minimum mortality temperature
   in each province. Heat-attributable and cold-attributable fractions of
   death were computed by separating the contributions from days with
   temperatures warmer and colder than the minimum mortality temperature,
   respectively.
   Findings Between 1980 and 2016, 4 576 600 cardiovascular deaths were
   recorded. For warm temperatures, the increase in relative risk (RR) of
   death from cardiovascular diseases was higher for women than men and
   higher for older individuals (aged >= 90 years) than younger individuals
   (aged 60-74 years), whereas for cold temperatures, RRs were higher for
   men than women, with no clear pattern by age group. The
   heat-attributable fraction of cardiovascular deaths was higher for women
   in all age groups, and the cold-attributable fraction was larger in men.
   The heat-attributable fraction increased with age for both sexes,
   whereas the cold-attributable fraction increased with age for men and
   decreased for women. Overall minimum mortality temperature increased
   from 19.5 degrees C between 1980 and 1994 to 20.2 degrees C between 2002
   and 2016, which is similar in magnitude to, and occurred in parallel
   with, the observed mean increase of 0.77 degrees C that occurred in
   Spain between these two time periods. In general, between 1980 and 2016,
   the risk and attributable fraction of cardiovascular deaths due to warm
   and cold temperatures decreased for men and women across all age groups.
   For all the age groups combined, between 1980-94 and 2002-16, the
   heat-attributable fraction decreased by -42.06\% (95\% empirical CI
   -44.39 to -41.06) for men and -36.64\% (-36.70 to -36.04) for women,
   whereas the cold-attributable fraction was reduced by -30.23\% (-30.34
   to -30.05) for men and -44.87\% (-46.77 to -42.94) for women.
   Interpretation In Spain, the observed warming of the climate has
   occurred in parallel with substantial adaptation to both high and low
   temperatures. The reduction in the RR and the attributable fraction
   associated with heat would be compatible with an adaptive response
   specifically addressing the negative consequences of climate change.
   Nevertheless, the simultaneous reduction in the RR and attributable
   fraction of cold temperatures also highlights the importance of more
   general factors such as socioeconomic development, increased life
   expectancy and quality, and improved health-care services in the
   country. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Transparency, Geomorphology and Mixing Regime Explain Variability in

   America (1975-2014)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Lake surface water temperatures are warming worldwide, raising concerns
   about the future integrity of valuable lake ecosystem services. In
   contrast to surface water temperatures, we know far less about what is
   happening to water temperature beneath the surface, where most organisms
   live. Moreover, we know little about which characteristics make lakes
   more or less sensitive to climate change and other environmental
   stressors. We examined changes in lake thermal structure for 231 lakes
   across northeastern North America (NENA), a region with an exceptionally
   high density of lakes. We determined how lake thermal structure has
   changed in recent decades (1975-2012) and assessed which lake
   characteristics are related to changes in lake thermal structure. In
   general, NENA lakes had increasing near-surface temperatures and thermal
   stratification strength. On average, changes in deepwater temperatures
   for the 231 lakes were not significantly different than zero, but
   individually, half of the lakes experienced warming and half cooling
   deepwater temperature through time. More transparent lakes (Secchi
   transparency >5 m) tended to have higher near-surface warming and
   greater increases in strength of thermal stratification than less
   transparent lakes. Whole-lake warming was greatest in polymictic lakes,
   where frequent summer mixing distributed heat throughout the water
   column. Lakes often function as important sentinels of climate change,
   but lake characteristics within and across regions modify the magnitude
   of the signal with important implications for lake biology, ecology and
   chemistry.},

Abstract = {We examine long-term trends in the average growth rates and maturation
   schedules of herring and sprat populations using survey data collected
   from the North Sea and west of Scotland since the 1960s and 1980s
   respectively. Otolith age data and maturity data are used to calculate
   time series of mean lengths at age, von Bertalanffy growth parameters,
   and probabilistic maturation reaction norms. As the growth and
   maturation of fish is known to be influenced by temperature and stock
   abundances, we account for these variables using Generalised Additive
   Models. Each of the herring populations displayed either steady declines
   in mean length across multiple age groups, or declines in length
   followed years later by some recovery. Depending on region, lengths at
   age of sprat increased or decreased over time. Varying temporal trends
   in maturation propensity at age and length were observed across herring
   populations. Many of the trends in growth rate and maturation were
   correlated to population abundance and/or temperature. In general,
   abundance is shown to be negatively correlated to growth rates in
   herring and sprat, and positively correlated with maturation propensity
   in herring. Temperature is also shown to be correlated to growth and
   maturation, and although the effect is consistent within species, the
   temperature effects differ between herring and sprat. This study
   provides detailed information about long-term trends in growth and
   maturation, which is lacking for some of these pelagic stocks,
   especially in the west of Scotland.},

Abstract = {According to trend computations at three stations each in Sahara desert
   (Libya), characterized by a ``hot{''} desert type ({''}BWh{''},
   according to the Koeppen climate classification), and in Central Asia
   (Xinjiang, China) identified as a ``cold{''} desert type ({''}BWk{''},
   after Koeppen), increasing annual temperatures were detected over the
   period 1955-2005 corresponding with global temperature warming. From
   1955-1978, negative (decreasing) temperature trends were, however,
   observed at all three hot desert stations and at two of the three cold
   desert stations. From 1979-2005, strikingly positive temperature trends
   were seen at all six stations. In seasonal respects, winter (December to
   February) and summer (June to August) show different temperature trends
   over the period 1955-2005: the hot desert experienced an increasing
   temperature trend at a greater extent in summer than in winter;
   vice-versa, in the cold desert positive trends were computed for winter
   and negative for summer. It can also be observed that mostly hot desert
   warming occurred in summer, opposite to cold desert warming in winter.

Abstract = {The surface of maximum wind (SMW) is used to examine spatial and
   temporal variability in the vertical position of jet streams and fast
   upper tropospheric wind maxima over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) in the
   NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis for summers 1958-2004. At a given observation time
   in a gridded data set, the SMW is defined as the surface passing through
   the fastest analyzed wind above each grid node, with a vertical search
   domain restricted to the upper troposphere and any tropospheric jet
   streams extending into the lower stratosphere. The 47-year mean summer
   SMW generally resides below the tropopause, undulates in the tropics,
   and descends poleward in middle and high latitudes. Trends in the
   pressure of the summer SMW are primarily positive, exceed 30 hPa/decade
   at some locations, and are found over most of the tropics and subtropics
   for the period 1958-2004. The thermal wind relationship is used to
   establish links between the SMW pressure trends and temperature gradient
   changes in the upper troposphere. The changing temperature gradients are
   consistent with nonuniform tropospheric warming and are correlated with
   sea surface temperature (SST) variability related to El Nino and the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Copyright (C) 2006 Royal Meteorological

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {To clarify the role of thermohaline factors in the formation of climatic
   trends in the North Atlantic (NA) thermohaline circulation, the
   contributions of changes in potential temperature and salinity to trends
   of the stream function of the Atlantic meridional overturning
   circulation (AMOC) were determined. To do this, using the INMOM
   (Institute of Numerical Mathematics Ocean Model) and data of the EN4
   electronic atlas (MetOffice, United Kingdom), the NA circulation was
   reconstructed by the diagnosis-adjustment method for the characteristic
   periods of 1951-2017, 1951-1990, and 1991-2017. In two selected periods
   of 1951-2017 and 1951-1990, all the main features of changes in the AMOC
   are explained mainly by temperature changes, which prevail over changes
   in salinity. At the same time, the observed trend towards weakening of
   the main core of the AMOC stream function from 1991 to 2017 is caused by
   changes in salinity, and the strengthening of the main core of the AMOC
   stream function from 1951 to 1990 is caused by changes in potential
   temperature. A relationship has been found between the trends of the
   AMOC stream function maximum at 38.5 degrees N and differences between
   zonally-averaged sea levels at 34.5 degrees N and 57.5 degrees N, which
   can possibly be used as the variability index of the AMOC stream
   function.},

Abstract = {New collecting at a biostratigraphically highly-resolved deep-water
   section in South China, reveals a brief (a few tens of thousands of
   years) but measurable delay in extinction timing relative to
   contemporaneous, shallower water sections. Foraminifers and conodonts in
   the Bianyang section show a sharp extinction at the top of Hindeodus
   changwingensis Zone, whilst in shallower sections, such as the
   well-known Meishan GSSP location, these taxa have a major extinction
   pulse at the top of the preceding Clarkina yini Zone. The main
   end-Permian extinction coincides with the onset of a negative carbon
   isotope excursion whilst the deep-water extinctions occur around the
   lowpoint of the carbon isotope curve. Rapidly increasing surface water
   temperatures, and the effects of deep-water anoxia were all important
   during the crisis although it is noteworthy that regression and
   extinction also show a close temporal link. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Only a climate model that is able to simulate well the historical
   atmospheric temperature trend can be used for estimating the future
   atmospheric temperature trends on different emission scenarios.
   Satellite-based Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) brightness temperature in
   the middle troposphere (T-2) is an important analog of midtropospheric
   atmospheric temperature. So, there is the need to compare the
   atmospheric temperature trend simulated by the fifth phase of the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) historical realizations
   and the observed MSU T-2. There are two approaches for estimating
   modeled MSU T-2: apply a global-mean static weighting function to
   generate the weighted average of the modeled temperature at all
   atmospheric layers and simulate satellite-view MSU T-2 using the model's
   output as input into a radiative transfer model (RTM). In this paper,
   the two approaches for estimating modeled MSU T-2 are evaluated. For
   each CMIP5, it is shown that there exists a model-simulated static
   weighting function, such that the MSU T-2 trend using the weighting
   function is equivalent to that calculated by RTM. The effect of modeled
   cloud liquid water on MSU T-2 trends in CMIP5 simulations is
   investigated by comparing the modeled cloud liquid water vertical
   profile and the weighting function. Moreover, it is found that warming
   trends of MSU T-2 for CMIP5 simulations calculated by the RTM are about
   15\% less than those using the two traditional static weighting
   functions. By comparing the model-derived weighting function with the
   two traditional weighting functions, the reason for the systematical
   biases is revealed.},

Title = {Temperature trends in the middle atmosphere as seen by historical

Abstract = {Long-term changes of the temperature of the middle atmosphere are
   investigated using a data bank obtained by Russian rocketsondes at Heiss
   Island (80.6 degrees N, 58 degrees E). The major interest of the data
   series is that it is one of the longest and uninterrupted records
   obtained at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere over 25 years,
   from 1969 to 1994. Previous estimates using this dataset has shown the
   largest trends. The revised analysis performed here took into account
   all possible discontinuities in the data series, Such as a change in the
   time-of-measurement, T-o, and in the type of sensor. For this purpose,
   some data were filtered out, and a statistical model based on multiple
   regression analyses included step functions to take into account Such
   discontinuities. The temperature responses to different sources of
   variability (solar activity, volcanic aerosols) were retrieved for
   Summer and winter periods. The response to the 11-year solar cycle in
   the winter period is found to be largely positive in the stratosphere
   (similar to+ 4 K) and largely negative in the mesosphere (similar to-8
   K), with a smaller and opposite response in summer. This response
   depends on the phase of the QBO, as already shown by previous studies.
   The response to volcanic aerosols is found to be significantly positive
   in the upper mesosphere, in good agreement with numerical simulations
   and with observations above France. The long-term trend resulting from
   this reanalysis indicates a cooling of the middle atmosphere, increasing
   with altitude from -2K/decade at 40km to a maximum of -6K/decade around
   65 km. This result is slightly larger than the trend observed at

Abstract = {In this study, we will demonstrate the uncertainty in the atmosphere
   evolution of a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model due to
   uncertainty in land surface fluxes. The NWP Model used in this work is
   the Computational Environmental Modelling System (CEMSYS 3) developed at
   the University of New South Wales. Simulations have been carried out for
   the whole of the Australian continent using 50 km grid spacing, with
   atmospheric forcing data supplied by the US National Center for
   Environmental Processes (NCEP). The simulations have been carried out
   for February 1996 for a range of continent-wide initial surface wetness
   conditions. The results show strong associations between simulated time
   sequences of soil moisture availability and surface heating rates.},

Abstract = {In the present study, the PRECIS, a regional climate model, is employed
   to simulate the baseline (1970-2000) and future 2071-2100 (2080s)
   maximum, minimum and diurnal temperature range changes under SRES A1B
   scenario over the Kancheepuram district of Tamil Nadu, South India. A
   comparison of the simulated baseline results with observation data
   acquired from IMD show that PRECIS can well simulate the local
   distribution characteristics of diurnal temperature range over the study
   area with a correlation coefficient (R2) value of 0.948 with 1\%
   significance level. Analyses of the simulated results in the 2080s under
   SRES A1B scenario relative to the baseline shows that there would be an
   overall increasing trend in the maximum and minimum temperatures over
   the study area and the warming amplitude in the north, west and interior
   parts are projected to be greater than in the east coastal areas. Sen's
   slope estimator supported by the Man Kendal test shows that the diurnal
   temperature range in the 2080s under SRES A1B scenario relative to the
   baseline are projected to decrease annually by -0.015 degrees C and a
   statistically significant decrease of -0.029 degrees C during the
   southwest monsoon season in the overall study area.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the annual and seasonal mean temperature trends
   of North-East Indian region and surrounding territories over the period
   1901-2020 with special emphasis on the trends from the recent past
   (1979-2020) utilising Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and ECMWF Reanalysis
   version-5 (ERA5) data. Spatio-temporal distribution of surface
   temperature across different seasons and associated biases between 1901
   and 2020 were examined. The long-term trend of temperature was evaluated
   by linear regression for each month from the entire 120-yr period over
   the whole study domain. Further, Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope test was
   employed to assess the magnitude of the trend at 11 selected locations
   of varying altitudes. Areas around Bangladesh, which are notably
   polluted, as well as Myanmar and the Indian states of West Bengal,
   Jharkhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh exhibited notable mean temperatures
   than the rest of the region. Both near-surface and 2m-temperature
   displayed positive trends for the period 1901-1950, 1979-2020, and
   during the whole duration 1901-2020, despite negative trends during
   1951-1978. It has been observed that the regions with relatively higher
   elevations have experienced a larger warming rate than the low-elevation
   zones.HighlightsAnnual and seasonal temperature trends for North-East
   India and surrounding territories were studied.Mann-Kendall and Sen's
   slope test was carried out for 11 selected locations.Post-monsoon season
   experienced greatest rise in mean temperatures between 1901 and
   2020.Temperature data revealed increasing trends for periods 1901-1950,
   1979-2020, but decreasing trends for 1951-1978.Warming rates were higher
   for higher elevation zones, particularly during the postmonsoon and

Title = {Decadal Stability and Trends in the Global Cloud Amount and Cloud Top
   Temperature in the Satellite-Based Climate Data Records},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Forty years of cloud observations are available globally from
   satellites, allowing derivation of climate data records (CDRs) for
   climate change studies. The aim of this study is to investigate how
   stable these cloud CDRs are and whether they qualify stability
   requirements recommended by the WMO's Global Climate Observing System
   (GCOS). We also investigate robust trends in global total cloud amount
   (CA) and cloud top temperature (CTT) that are significant and common
   across all CDRs. The latest versions of four global cloud CDRs, namely
   CLARA-A3, ESA Cloud CCI, PATMOS-x, and ISCCP-HGM are analysed. This
   assessment finds that all three AVHRR-based cloud CDRs (i.e., CLARA-A3,
   ESA Cloud CCI and PATMOS-x) satisfy even the strictest GCOS stability
   requirements for CA and CTT when averaged globally. While CLARA-A3 is
   most stable in global averages when tested against MODIS-Aqua, PATMOS-x
   offers the most stable CDR spatially. While we find these results highly
   encouraging, there remain, however, large spatial differences in the
   stability of and across the CDRs. All four CDRs continue to agree on the
   statistically significant decrease in global cloud amount over the last
   four decades, although this decrease is now weaker compared to the
   previous assessments. This decreasing trend has been stabilizing or even
   reversing in the last two decades; the latter is seen also in MODIS-Aqua
   and CALIPSO GEWEX datasets. Statistically significant trends in CTT are
   observed in global averages in the AVHRR-based CDRs, but the spatial
   agreement in the sign and the magnitude of the trends is weaker compared
   to those in CA. We also present maps of Common Stability Coverage and
   Common Trend Coverage that could provide a valuable metric to carry out
   an ensemble-based analysis of the CDRs.},

Abstract = {The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) is characterized by complex
   oceanographic dynamics that affect the regional sea surface temperature
   (SST), a key parameter driving marine ecosystems. To date no comparative
   studies have been conducted on the spatial and temporal variations of
   SST among the several marine protected areas in the ETP. The present
   study used remote sensing to evaluate the monthly, annual, and decadal
   variations in SST from 1982 to 2019 in Coiba National Park (Coiba),
   Cocos Island National Park (Cocos), Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary
   (Malpelo), Gorgona Island National Park (Gorgona), Galapagos Marine
   Reserve (Galapagos) and La Plata Island (La Plata). An overall
   increasing trend in SST was observed across all study sites, except for
   West Galapagos. A decrease in SST anomaly was observed from February
   through April at Malpelo, Coiba, Gorgona and La Plata. These
   observations are likely in response to the Humboldt Current and
   upwelling events in the Colombian Pacific Basin. Using a longer SST
   dataset is recommended to determine if the annual, monthly and decadal
   trends observed here are driven by local, regional or global processes.
   Consistent monitoring of SST trends is a strategic practice in
   understanding and planning for current and projected changes in the
   marine environment.},

Abstract = {Quantitative estimates of the contribution of anthropogenic forcing,
   characterized by changes in the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases in
   the atmosphere, and key modes of natural climatic variability to the
   surface temperature trends in different latitudinal zones of the
   Northern (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) for various time horizons
   have been obtained using observational data. In particular, using
   three-component autoregressive models and data since the 19th century,
   the role of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the El-Nino/Southern
   Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Interdecadal Pacific
   Oscillation, and the Antarctic Oscillation in the formation of
   temperature trends was assessed. The results of the analysis indicate
   the significant role of changes in the radiative forcing of greenhouse
   gases in the atmosphere in the formation of the global surface air
   temperature trend, which increases with an increase in the time horizon.
   At the same time, significant differences were noted for the latitudinal
   zones of the SH and NH, associated with the influence of different modes
   of natural climatic variability. At weaker temperature trends in the SH
   latitudinal zones with greater ocean coverage than in the NH, negative
   trends in the surface air temperature on intervals of several decades
   against the general background of long-period global warming be and are
   manifested due to natural climate fluctuations. One of the key climatic
   problems of recent years is the mutually opposite trends in the extent
   of Antarctic and Arctic sea ice, which is associated with the noted
   global and regional features of the temperature variations.},

Abstract = {In babies, a very important factor, is the body temperature, since the
   increase in this factor indicates a defense mechanism that the body uses
   to try to combat diseases. Especially in the baby's sleep hours it is
   not very easy to see a change in temperature, because it frequently
   concurs with the parents' sleep time, therefore the babies are less
   supervised. It is important to mention that an increase in temperature
   in a short time can generate a febrile complication and cause Sudden
   Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a problem that affects approximately 533
   babies per year according from the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics)
   {[}1]{[}2]. In this project an electronic device is developed that
   census the temperature in real time. At the same time, it sends the
   level of audio captured from babies between 0-12 months of age, to the
   end user in order to assist parents in monitoring the baby. The device
   is developed to be placed in the baby's bed. When the device detects an
   increase outside the normal range of body temperature, or a high level
   of noise, it transfers the data via WiFi and Bluetooth to a web platform
   and it sends an alarm via a mobile application to the parents indicating
   an alteration in the state of the baby.},

Abstract = {The study investigated temporal variations of record and absolute
   maximum and minimum air temperatures (T-max and T-min, respectively),
   and surface and upper atmospheric conditions in years, in which the
   highest number of events were observed at 90 stations of Turkey during
   period of 1950-2015. The results have shown that annual frequency of
   record T-min events revealed an evident decreasing since mid-1980s while
   frequency of T-max events increased particularly starting from the year
   of 2000. Half of record T-max events were recorded during 2000-2015
   period. On the other hand, daily absolute T-max occurred mostly in 2000,
   whereas daily absolute T-min events were mostly recorded in 1953.
   With respect to linkages to atmospheric teleconnection patterns,
   statistically significant negative relationships were detected between
   numbers of Turkey's record T-max events and the North Atlantic
   Oscillation Index (NAOI) in July, December, and annually, and between
   the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI) and the record T-max events in winter
   months. The North Sea-Caspian Pattern Index (NCPI)had a significantly
   strong negative relationship with record-breaking T-max events in
   February, March, August, October, and annually. However, statistically
   significant relationships found between the NCPI and record T-min events
   in November, January, and annually are different from other atmospheric
   oscillations.
   Well-defined synoptic-scale surface and upper atmospheric circulation
   anomalies closely controlled occurrence and nature/magnitude of highest
   number of recordbreaking T-max events in Turkey by carrying frequently
   the tropical origin weather systems and continental tropical warm/hot
   air masses towards Turkey and her surroundings. On the other hands,
   record-breaking T-min events detected were related closely with the
   patterns of surface and upper atmospheric circulation anomalies carrying
   frequently polar and subpolar or mid-latitudinal weather systems with
   the continental polar air masses mostly cold and stable to Turkey and
   her surrounding regions.},

Abstract = {Trending RMS current in an induction motor is often performed in
   industrial processes because of the availability and easy measurement of
   the parameter. This current can deviate widely with temperature, voltage
   and speed, making it difficult to determine process changes that are to
   be detected. Current deviations due to normal operation of the system
   can be corrected by applying the motor model equations to adjust the
   current so that the trending variable is more robust to normal
   variations in motor driven processes yet still detects abnormal process
   occurrences, A full motor model (requiring all steady state circuit
   parameters) is applied to correct the measured current, independently
   for voltage, speed and temperature changes in the motor driven process
   showing much reduced trended variable variation for normal process
   condition changes. A simplified model is also presented. This model
   requires only nameplate motor data and no load current as equation
   parameters and is shown to also reduce trended variable variation. Both
   the full motor model and the simplified model trended values are shown
   to detect motor winding partial failure that would not be detected by
   trending current alone.},

Volume = {114},

Abstract = {Fourteen-year time series of mesospheric and upper stratospheric
   temperature versus altitude or T(z) from the Halogen Occultation
   Experiment (HALOE) are analyzed and reported. The data have been binned
   according to 10 degrees-wide latitude zones from 40 degrees S to 40
   degrees N and at 10 altitudes from 43 to 80 km: a total of 90 separate
   time series. Multiple linear regression analysis techniques have been
   applied to those time series. This study focuses on resolving their
   11-year solar cycle (SC) (or SC-like) responses and their linear trend
   terms. Findings for T(z) from HALOE are compared with published results
   from ground-based Rayleigh lidar and from rocketsonde measurements.
   SC-like responses from HALOE compare well with those from the lidar
   station data. The cooling trends from HALOE also agree reasonably well
   with those from the lidar data at low latitudes for the concurrent
   decade. Cooling trends of the lower mesosphere from HALOE are not as
   large as those from rocketsondes and from the lidar station time series
   of the previous two decades, presumably because the changes in the upper
   stratospheric ozone are near zero during the HALOE time period and do
   not contribute to its trends.},

Title = {Lake Surface Water Temperature in high altitude lakes in the Pyrenees:
   Combining satellite with monitoring data to assess recent trends},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {933},
Month = {JUL 10},
Abstract = {Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) influences critical bio-geological
   processes in lake ecosystems, and there is growing evidence of rising
   LSWT over recent decades worldwide and future shifts in thermal patterns
   are expected to be a major consequence of global warming. At a regional
   scale, assessing recent trends and anticipating impacts requires data
   from a number of lakes, but long term in situ monitoring programs are
   scarce, particularly in mountain areas. In this work, we propose the
   combined use of satellite-derived temperature with in situ data for a
   five-year period (2017-2022) from 5 small (<0.5km(2)) high altitude
   (1880-2680 masl) Pyrenean lakes. The comparison of in situ and
   satellite-derived data in a common period (2017-2022) during the summer
   season showed a notably high (r = 0.94, p < 0.01) correlation
   coefficient, indicative of a robust relationship between the two data
   sources. The root mean square errors ranged from 1.8 degrees C to 3.9
   degrees C, while the mean absolute errors ranged from 1.6 degrees C to
   3.6 degrees C. We applied the obtained in situ-satellite eq. (2017-2022)
   to Landsat 5, 7 and 8/9 data since 1985 to reconstruct the summer
   surface temperature of the five studied lakes with in situ data and to
   four additional lakes with no in situ monitoring data. Reconstructed
   LSWT for the 1985-2022 showed an upward trend in all lakes. Moreover,
   paleolimnological reconstructions based on sediment cores studies
   demonstrate large changes in the last decades in organic carbon
   accumulation, sediment fluxes and bioproductivity in the Pyrenean lakes.
   Our research represents the first comprehensive investigation conducted
   on high mountain lakes in the Pyrenees that compares field monitoring
   data with satellite-derived temperature records. The results demonstrate
   the reliability of satellite-derived LSWT for surface temperatures in
   small lakes, and provide a tool to improve the LSWT in lakes with no
   monitoring surveys.},

Abstract = {In this study, observed temperature records of 12 stations from
   Antarctica island, coastline, and continental areas are analyzed by
   means of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). After Monte Carlo
   significance tests, different long-term climate memory (LTM) behaviors
   are found: temperatures from coastal and island stations are
   characterized by significant long-term climate memory whereas
   temperatures over the Antarctic continent behave more like white noise,
   except for the Byrd station, which is located in the West Antarctica. It
   is argued that the emergence of LTM may be dominated by the interactions
   between local weather system and external slow-varying systems (ocean),
   and therefore the different LTM behaviors between temperatures over the
   Byrd station and that over other continental stations can be considered
   as a reflection of the different climatic environments between West and
   East Antarctica. By calculating the trend significance with the effect
   of LTM taken into account, and further comparing the results with those
   obtained from assumptions of autoregressive (AR) process and white
   noise, it is found that 1) most of the Antarctic stations do not show
   any significant trends over the past several decades, and 2) more
   rigorous trend evaluation can be obtained if the effect of LTM is
   considered. Therefore, it is emphasized that for air temperatures over
   Antarctica, especially for the Antarctica coastline, island, and the
   west continental areas, LTM is nonnegligible for trend evaluation.},

Title = {Annual and seasonal air temperature trend patterns of climate change and

Abstract = {With a view to estimating climate change and its urban-induced bias in
   selected Turkish cities, we have used data from the period 1951 to 1990
   recorded by 54 climate stations, four of which are corrected for their
   inhomogeneities. Two sets are produced; S1, including the large urban
   stations, and S2, consisting of rural, small urban and medium urban
   stations. Normalized Kendall trend test coefficients with a spatial
   prediction scheme, kriging, are used to construct spatial patterns of
   both sets together and separately. Results reveal a statistically
   significant cooling in mean temperatures mostly in northern regions and
   warming in minimum temperatures specific to large urban areas. Seasonal
   analysis shows that most of this cooling has been occurring ill the
   summer and urban warming in the spring. The causes-of cooling is
   investigated in relation to some air pollutants, SO2 and particulate
   matter (PM). Linear regressions performed on the time series resulted in
   a significant urban bias of 0.24 degrees C per 40 years on mean
   temperatures and 0.56 degrees C/40 years on minimum temperatures. In
   association with the above results, a decrease in the temperature range
   of 0.48 degrees C over the period owing to urban bias was found. A 0.24
   degrees C urban bias magnitude of mean temperature trends is much
   greater than the results found on other three regions of the Earth
   {[}Jones et al., 1990]. An overall average cooling ill mean
   temperatures, -0.07 degrees C per decade, detected here is the same as
   Nasrallah and Balling's {[}1993] average result for the two grid points
   located over Turkey.},

Abstract = {Forty years of temperature and wind measurements at Karlsruhe Institute
   of Technology's 200-m high meteorological tower in the Upper Rhine
   Valley in Southwest Germany are used to calculate trends in the mixed
   and residual layer respectively, which can be compared to trends in the
   surface layer. For trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall test is used. Data
   are analysed on an annual, seasonal, and daily scale. For the variable
   temperature, a significant positive annual trend is found. Seasonally,
   the strongest temperature increases are observed in spring and summer.
   This is also reflected by significant positive trends for meteorological
   indices such as summer days, tropical days, and growing season length.
   On a daily scale, the strongest temperature increase is found in the
   mixed layer during nighttime. This results in a stronger stable
   stratification and in a higher number of surface inversions. Wind speed
   measurements reveal a significant negative annual trend in the mixed
   layer at a height of 200m. Seasonally, weakly negative trends are found
   for spring and summer. It can be shown that the trends for wind speed
   are only partly be related to modifications of surface roughness in the
   vicinity of the site.},

Abstract = {Under the hypothesis that the presence of climate trends in the annual
   extreme minimum air temperature series of Campinas (Tminabs; 1891-2010;
   22 degrees 54'S; 47 degrees 05'W; 669 m) may no longer be neglected, the
   aim of the work was to describe the probabilistic structure of this
   series based on the general extreme value distribution (GEV) with
   parameters estimated as a function of a time covariate. The results
   obtained by applying the likelihood ratio test and the
   percentil-percentil and quantil-quantil plots, have indicated that the
   use of a time-dependent model provides a feasible description of the
   process under evaluation. In this non-stationary GEV model the
   parameters of location and scale were expressed as time-dependent
   functions. The shape parameter remained constant. It was also verified
   that although this non-stationary model has indicated an average
   increase in the values of the analyzed data, it does not allow us to
   conclude that the region of Campinas is now free from frost occurrence
   since this same model also reveals an increasing trend in the
   dispersions of the variable under evaluation. However, since the
   parameters of location and scale of this probabilistic model are
   significantly conditioned on time, the presence of climate trends in the
   analyzed time series is proven.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, analyses on global data have not reached
   unanimous consensus on whether warmer and humid weather curbs the spread
   of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We conjectured that this lack of consensus is
   due to the discrepancy between global environmental data such as
   temperature and humidity being collected outdoors, while most infections
   have been reported to occur indoors, where conditions can be different.
   Thus, we have methodologically investigated the effect of temperature
   and relative humidity on the spread of expired respiratory droplets from
   the mouth, which are assumed to be the main cause of most short-range
   infections. Calculating the trajectory of individual droplets using an
   experimentally validated evaporation model, the final height and
   distance of the evaporated droplets is obtained, and then correlated
   with global COVID-19 spread. Increase in indoor humidity is associated
   with reduction in COVID-19 spread, while temperature has no
   statistically significant effect.},

Abstract = {Increasing attention is being placed on the regional impact of climate
   change. This study focuses on the decadal scale variabilities of
   temperature and salinity in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB), Georges Bank
   (GB), and Gulf of Maine (GOM) from 1977 to 2016 using hydrographic
   survey data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) Northeast Fisheries Science Center. The MAB (as defined by the
   shelf regions from Cape Hatteras to Cape Cod) experienced warming rates
   of 0.57 degrees C per decade during the Winter/Spring season (Jan-Apr)
   and 0.47 degrees C per decade during the Fall/Winter season (Sep-Dec).
   The GOM and GB, on the other hand, warmed at approximately half the rate
   of the MAB over the same time span (1977-2016). We found that rates of
   warming vary on decadal time scales. From 1977 to 1999, significant
   temperature increases (>0.6 degrees C/decade) were found in the southern
   regions of the MAB during the Winter/Spring season. During the same
   period, significant freshening (stronger than -0.2/decade) was found in
   GB and the northern regions of the MAB during the Winter/Spring and
   Summer seasons. From 1999 to 2016, on the other hand, we found no
   significant trends in temperature and few significant trends in salinity
   with the exceptions of some northern MAB regions showing significant
   salting. Interannual variability in shelf salinity can in part be
   attributed to river discharge variability in the Hudson River and
   Chesapeake Bay. However, decadal scale change in shelf salinity cannot
   be attributed to changes in river discharge as there were no significant
   decadal scale changes in river outflow. Variability in along-shelf
   freshwater transport and saline intrusions from offshore were the likely
   drivers of long-term changes in MAB shelf-salinity.},

   and NOAA Climate Division data plus comparisons to reanalyses},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {Warming is a major climate change concern, but the impact of high
   maximum temperatures depends upon the air's moisture content. Trends in
   maximum summertime temperature, moisture, and heat index are tracked
   over three time periods: 1900-2011, 1950-2011, and 1979-2011; these
   trends differ notably from annual temperature trends. Trends are
   emphasized from two CRU datasets (CRUTS3.25 and CRUTS4.01) and two
   reanalyses (ERA-20C and 20CRv2). Maximum temperature trends tend towards
   warming that is stronger over the Great Lakes, the interior western and
   the northeastern contiguous United States. A warming hole in the Midwest
   generally decreases in size and magnitude when heat stress trends are
   calculated because the region has increasing moisture. CRU and nearly
   all reanalyses find cooling in the northern high plains that is not
   found in NOAA Climate Division trends. These NOAA trends are captured
   better by CRUTS401. Moistening in the northeast amplifies the heat
   stress there. Elsewhere the moisture trends are less clear. Drying over
   northern Texas (after 1996) in CRUTS401 translates into decreasing heat
   stress there (less so in CRUTS325). Though other reanalyses are not
   intended for long-term trends, MERRA-2 and ERA-Interim match observed
   trends better than other reanalyses.},

Abstract = {We present a new analysis of long-term changes of temperature using data
   from a rocketsonde data series obtained at Volgograd (48.68 degrees N,
   44.35 degrees E) from January 1969 to September 1995. In this series,
   temperature measurements exhibit discontinuities due to instrumental
   changes that need to be taken into account for trend estimates. Also
   changes of the moment when the measurements were performed can also
   induce discontinuities associated with the existence of atmospheric
   tides and bias related to solar elevation angle. Data have been selected
   according to the hour of the launch and sub-sets of data have been
   generated in order to identify homogeneous datasets. The trend analysis
   method used here is based on a multi-function regression analysis that
   assumes a linear long-term trend superimposed on natural variability.
   Sudden changes of the calculated mean temperature, potentially induced
   by discontinuities. have been estimated and taken into account by
   including step functions in the regression model.
   This analysis shows a cooling in the middle stratosphere. with magnitude
   increasing with altitude up to 10-15 K/decade in the upper mesosphere.
   The results obtained are compared with trend estimates performed earlier
   for other mid-latitudes data series using the same analysis. It shows a
   slight increase of the trend with latitude, despite the limited number
   of sites. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Seasonal trends in photosynthetic parameters and stomatal conductance of
   blue oak (<i>Quercus douglasii</i>) under prolonged summer drought and
   high temperature},

Abstract = {Understanding seasonal changes in photosynthetic parameters and stomatal
   conductance is crucial for modeling long-term carbon uptake and energy
   fluxes of ecosystems. Gas exchange measurements Of CO(2) and light
   response curves on blue oak leaves (Quercus douglasii H. \& A.) were
   conducted weekly throughout the growing season to study the seasonality
   of photosynthetic capacity (V(cmax)) and Ball-Berry slope (m) under
   prolonged summer drought and high temperature. A leaf photosynthetic
   model was used to determine V(cmax).
   There was a pronounced seasonal pattern in V(cmax). The maximum value of
   V(cmax), 127 mumol m(-2) s(-1), was reached shortly after leaf expansion
   in early summer, when air temperature was moderate and soil water
   availability was high. Thereafter, V(cmax) declined as the soil water
   profile became depleted and the trees experienced extreme air
   temperatures, exceeding 40 degreesC. The decline in V(cmax) was gradual
   in midsummer, however, despite extremely low predawn leaf water
   potentials (Psi(pd), similar to -4.0 MPa). Overall, temporal changes in
   V(cmax) were well correlated with changes in leaf nitrogen content.
   During spring leaf development, high rates of leaf dark respiration
   (R(d), 5-6 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) were observed. Once a leaf reached
   maturity, Rd remained low, around 0.5 mumol m(-2) s(-1). In contrast to
   the strong seasonality of Vc, m and marginal water cost per unit carbon
   gain (partial derivativeE/partial derivativeA) were relatively constant
   over the season, even when leaf Psi(pd) dropped to -6.8 MPa. The
   constancy of partial derivativeE/partial derivativeA suggests that
   stomata behaved optimally under severe water-stress conditions. We
   discuss the implications of our findings in the context of modeling
   carbon and water vapor exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere.},

Title = {Continuation of tropical Pacific Ocean temperature trend may weaken
   extreme El Nino and its linkage to the Southern Annular Mode},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Observational records show that occurrences of the negative polarity of
   the Southern Annular Mode (low SAM) is significantly linked to El Nino
   during austral spring and summer, potentially providing long-lead
   predictability of the SAM and its associated surface climate conditions.
   In this study, we explore how this linkage may change under a scenario
   of a continuation of the ocean temperature trends that have been
   observed over the past 60 years, which are plausibly forced by
   increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. We generated coupled model
   seasonal forecasts for three recent extreme El Nino events by
   initialising the forecasts with observed ocean anomalies of 1 September
   1982, 1997 and 2015 added into (1) the current ocean mean state and into
   (2) the ocean mean state updated to include double the recent ocean
   temperature trends. We show that the strength of extreme El Nino is
   reduced with the warmer ocean mean state as a result of reduced
   thermocline feedback and weakened rainfall-wind-sea surface temperature
   coupling over the tropical eastern Pacific. The El Nino-low SAM
   relationship also weakens, implying the possibility of reduced long-lead
   predictability of the SAM and associated surface climate impacts in the
   future.},

Title = {The Role of the Tropically Excited Arctic Warming Mechanism on the Warm
   Arctic Cold Continent Surface Air Temperature Trend Pattern},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {46},
Number = {14},
Pages = {8490-8499},
Month = {JUL 28},
Abstract = {The December-February surface air temperature (SAT) trend is examined
   for all consecutive 20-year time periods between 1979 and 2017, from
   which a transition from a cold-Arctic-warm-continent toward a
   warm-Arctic-cold-continent trend pattern is evident. This transition is
   accompanied by a consistent transition in the sea level pressure trend
   pattern that supports warm air advection over the Arctic and cold air
   advection over the continents. The regression of the detrended
   December-February-average SAT onto a detrended index defined to quantify
   the east-west gradient of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature is
   characterized by a warm-Arctic-cold-continent pattern much like the SAT
   trend pattern observed in recent decades. A decadal timescale warming of
   the western tropical Pacific water has increased the east-west gradient
   of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature, thus contributing to the
   observed extratropical SAT trend transition.
   Plain Language Summary Over the last two decades, Arctic surface
   temperatures have been increasing rapidly-at a rate faster than anywhere
   else on the globe. Concurrent with this rapid increase of Arctic surface
   temperatures, surface temperatures over the North American and Eurasian
   continents have decreased. This simultaneous warming of the Arctic and
   cooling of the continents was preceded by a period of simultaneous
   Arctic cooling and continental warming.
   The transition from the period of Arctic cooling and continental warming
   toward the present period of Arctic warming and continental cooling was
   likely caused by southerly winds (flowing from south to north) over the
   Arctic and northerly winds (flowing from north to south) over the
   continents. These winds move warm air into the Arctic and cold air over
   the continents. We present evidence that these circulation changes, and
   the associated temperature changes, are driven in part by the warming of
   the western tropical Pacific water (relative to the eastern tropical
   Pacific), which started at about the same time that the above transition
   occurred. The chain of events that link warming of the western
   equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean to circulation changes over the Arctic
   and continents is discussed in previous studies.},

Title = {The effect of reference-condition-based temperature modification on the

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {194},
Pages = {204-213},

Abstract = {Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) has a significant role in
   agricultural water management. Commonly, FA056 Penman-Monteith as
   standard method is used to calculate ET0. To apply this method,
   meteorological data recorded at reference stations are required. The use
   of non-reference stations data in ET0 calculation can affect trend of
   this parameter. In the present study, the effect of reference-condition
   based temperature modification on ET0 trend was evaluated. For this
   purpose, the collected data from 27 non-reference meteorological
   stations during 1960-2014 were applied. The mentioned stations are
   located in arid or semi-arid regions of Iran. The trends of unchanged
   and modified values of ET0 in studied stations were calculated using the
   Mann-Kendall method. Trend results showed that unchanged values of ET0
   had a positive trend, while the modified ones had a negative trend in
   more than 50\% of stations at seasonal and annual scales. According to
   R-2 and RMSE results, there was no correlation between the trends of
   unchanged and modified values of ET0 and temperature modification based
   on the reference condition can change the trend values of ET0. Also, the
   results of T-statistic showed that the difference between two values of
   trend in arid regions was more than that of semi-arid ones. This
   difference in stations with arid climate was significant at 95\%
   confidence level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Hydrogen has many positive attributes that make it a viable choice to
   augment the current portfolio of combustion-based fuels, especially when
   considering reducing pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   However, conventional methods of storing H-2 via high-pressure or liquid
   H-2 do not provide long-term economic solutions for many applications,
   especially emerging applications such as man-portable or stationary
   power. Hydrogen storage in materials has the potential to meet the
   performance and cost demands, however, further developments are needed
   to address the thermodynamics and kinetics of H-2 uptake and release.
   Therefore, the US Department of Energy (DOE) initiated three Centers of
   Excellence focused on developing H-2 storage materials that could meet
   the stringent performance requirements for on-board vehicular
   applications. In this review, we have summarized the developments that
   occurred as a result of the efforts of the Metal Hydride and Chemical
   Hydrogen Storage Centers of Excellence on materials that bind hydrogen
   through ionic and covalent linkages and thus could provide moderate
   temperature, dense phase H-2 storage options for a wide range of
   emerging Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEM FC) applications.},

Abstract = {In this study, decadal trend analysis of atmospheric temperature, water
   vapour, ozone, methane and carbon-monoxide has been presented over few
   major cities of India using Aqua-AIRS products from 2003 to 2012. The
   atmospheric column is studied in few atmospheric layers, viz.,
   surface-850, 850-500, 500-100, 100-50 and 50-1 hPa for temperature,
   water vapour and ozone. However, CH4 and CO results are presented in
   total column amounts. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall test has been applied
   to investigate the trends of annual means of parameters and Sen's slope
   estimate has been used to find the rate of the change, if there is a
   trend. The layer average temperature (LAT) has been found to be
   increasing in lower troposphere (surface-850 hPa) and decreasing in
   lower stratosphere (100-50 hPa). The warming trend over Chennai is found
   to be not limited in lower tropospheric region, but extended in 850-500
   hPa layer also. However, LAT (850-500 hPa) has decreasing trend over
   Thiruvananthapuram. LAT in 500-100 hPa has significant decreasing trend
   only over Ahmedabad. The decreasing LAT trend in 100-50 hPa is quite
   prominent with significant decreasing trends over Mumbai, Ahmedabad,
   Kolkata and Hyderabad. The layer integrated water vapour (LIWV) is found
   be increasing mainly in surface-850 hPa and 850-500 hPa layers. The
   decreasing trend of LIWV has been observed only over Ahmedabad in
   500-100 hPa layer. For total column water vapour, the trends are mostly
   increasing, however, it is statistically significant only over
   Hyderabad. The layer integrated ozone has been found to be increasing in
   troposphere and decreasing in lower stratosphere. The increasing trend
   of ozone in troposphere is most prominent in lower-mid tropospheric
   region (850-500 hPa layer). No significant trend has been observed for
   total column ozone. Total column methane has shown significant
   increasing trend over all cities with very good significance level.
   However, for total column carbon-monoxide, the trends are decreasing and
   the decreasing trends are significant over Delhi and Mumbai.},

Abstract = {The Dead Sea basin is the lowest terrestrial site on the globe. A
   meteorological station monitoring the global, UVB and UVA irradiation,
   and the dry bulb temperature was established in 1995 in conjunction with
   a study of bio-climatological properties of the region with regard to
   photoclimatherapy treatment of dermatological diseases. The availability
   of such irradiation and dry bulb temperature databases has been utilized
   to perform a study to determine if any trends regarding either
   irradiation or dry bulb temperature exists at this unique site. The
   global irradiation database included the time interval 1995-2021,
   whereas the corresponding time interval for the UVB and UVA irradiation
   databases was 1995-2018. There was no indication of any trends, based
   upon a p value analysis with regard to the global and UVB and UVA
   irradiation with the exception of global irradiation during September
   (-120.7 Wh/m(2)/decade; similar to 2\%/decade) and UVA irradiation
   during March (+11.1 Wh/m(2)/decade; similar to 4\%/decade) and September
   (- 9.1 Wh/m(2)/decade; similar to 0.6\%/decade).
   The dry bulb temperature database consisted of the time interval
   1995-2021 and trends were observed during the months of August,
   September, and October. The dry bulb temperature data were analyzed as a
   function of time (Israel Standard Time) interval; viz., diurnal from
   06:00 to 18:00, nocturnal from 18:00 to 06:00, and daily from 00:00 to
   24:00. The trends observed during these three months varied between 0.38
   and 0.70 degrees C/decade.},

Title = {Change in the Recent Warming Trend of Sea Surface Temperature in the
   East Sea (Sea of Japan) over Decades (1982-2018)},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Long-term trends of sea surface temperature (SST) of the East Sea (Sea
   of Japan, EJS) were estimated by using 37-year-long satellite data, for
   the observation period from 1982 to 2018. Overall, the SST tended to
   increase with time, for all analyzed regions. However, the warming trend
   was steeper in the earlier decades since the 1980s and slowed down
   during the recent two decades. Based on the analysis of the occurrence
   of events with extreme SST (high in the summertime and low in the
   wintertime), a shift toward the more frequent occurrence of events with
   extremely high SST and the less frequent occurrence of events with
   extremely low SST has been observed. This supports the observations of
   the consistent warming of the EJS. However, seasonal trends revealed
   continuous SST warming in the summertime, but frequent extreme SST
   cooling in the wintertime, in recent decades. The observed reduction in
   the warming rates occurred more frequently in specific regions of the
   EJS, where the occurrence frequency of events with extremely low SST was
   unusually high in the recent decade. The recent tendency toward the SST
   cooling was distinctively connected with variations in the Arctic
   Oscillation index. This suggests that changes in the Arctic Ocean
   environment likely affect the recently observed SST changes in the EJS,
   as one of the marginal seas in the mid-latitude region far from the
   polar region.},

Abstract = {An opposite trend in surface air temperature is observed with centers
   over the eastern Bering Sea (decreasing trend) and the Sea of Okhotsk
   (increasing trend) during 1979-2015. The present study analyzes the
   reasons for the formation of the contrasting surface air temperature
   trends in the above two regions. Analysis shows that downward longwave
   radiation and anomalous meridional advection are two major terms for
   surface air temperature trends in the above regions. The surface
   turbulent heat flux trends are results of surface air temperature
   trends. The cooling trend over the eastern Bering Sea is related to the
   cloud cover decreasing trend and northerly wind trend. The former
   reduces downward longwave radiation, and the latter leads to anomalous
   cold advection. The warming trend over the Sea of Okhotsk is associated
   with the cloud cover increase that leads to downward longwave radiation
   increase and the southerly wind trend that induces anomalous warm
   advection. The cloud changes are related to anticyclonic wind changes
   over the northern North Pacific. The surface air temperature increasing
   trends appear to contribute to the sea ice decreasing trends in the Sea
   of Okhotsk. The present analysis suggests an important role of
   atmospheric circulation changes in the formation of opposite March
   surface air temperature trends over the eastern Bering Sea and the Sea
   of Okhotsk.},

Title = {The effects of recent changes in air temperature on trends in airborne

   in Bratislava (Slovakia)},
Journal = {AEROBIOLOGIA},

Abstract = {Over the period 2002-2014, air temperature significantly increased
   regionally for Bratislava. However, no significant shifts have been
   observed in other meteorological parameters examined. The aim of this
   study was to analyse the effect of significant temperature trends on
   timing, duration and intensity of Alternaria, Epicoccum and Stemphylium
   spore seasons. Aerobiological monitoring was conducted using a Burkard
   7-day volumetric spore trap. Mann-Kendall tau test was used to determine
   trends in spore seasons characteristics, whereas Spearman's correlation
   coefficients were calculated to establish the relationships between
   temperature and spore season time series. Spore seasons of analysed taxa
   changed throughout the years of study. Alternaria spore season now
   starts earlier, ends later and lasts longer. Start, end and peak dates
   as well as duration of Alternaria spore seasons were significantly
   correlated with recorded increases in winter temperatures. Despite
   significant lengthening of Alternaria spore seasons, the lack of rising
   trend in its spore season index has been registered. This phenomenon
   could be partly explained by the reduction in the source vegetation due
   to drop of agricultural land use areas in Bratislava. In contrast, the
   intensity of Stemphylium spore seasons significantly increased during
   the study period and was correlated with recorded increases in
   summer-autumn temperatures. Based on the results of this study, it could
   be concluded that changes in selected fungal spore season patterns in
   Bratislava (earlier start date, later end date and longer duration of
   Alternaria spore seasons and higher Stemphylium spore season indexes)
   might be caused by the recorded local change in air temperature.},

Title = {ASSESSMENT OF CLIMATIC TREND OF AIR TEMPERATURE AT THE EARTH SURFACE IN
   THE CONTEXT OF STABLE DEVELOPMENT (CASE OF GYUMRI CITY)},
Journal = {VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY

Abstract = {Formulation of the problem. The study and assessment of air temperature
   fluctuations, especially in conditions of expected climate change, is of
   particular relevance and haste. At the same time, the assessment of
   temporary changes in air temperature is important as a guarantee of
   stable development and a long-term economic development.
   The purpose of the article. The purpose of this work is to find out,
   analyze and evaluate the patterns of the dynamic changes in air
   temperature in Gyumri city.
   To solve this problem, the results of actual observations of the air
   temperature of the Gyumri weather station, stored at the Ministry of
   Emergency Situations of the Republic of Armenia ``Service for
   Hydrometeorology and active influence on atmospheric phenomena{''} have
   been collected, refined and analyzed.
   Methods. In the course of research we analyzed and clarified appropriate
   literary sources, using mathematical-statistical, extrapolation,
   complex, analyze and correlation methods.
   Results. A multifactorial correlation relationship was obtained between
   the average annual air temperature and its absolute maximum and minimum
   values of Gyumri city. A close correlation was also obtained between the
   average annual air temperature and its absolute maximum and minimum
   values of Gyumri city, between the average annual and extreme values of
   the surface air temperature and the absolute maximum and minimum values
   of the soil surface of Gyumri city. This makes it possible to calculate
   the value of any temperature characteristic, while having the other one.
   Note that in winter the average air temperature values do not differ
   much from the average soil surface temperature values. This difference
   grows and reaches its maximum in summer (July - August).
   As a result of the research, it turned out that according to the actual
   data on the air temperature in Gyumri city, there was a tendency for the
   average annual values and absolute maximum of the air temperature to
   rise, while the absolute minimum values showed a downward trend (in the
   absolute sense). That is, in the study area in the warm season, an
   increase in aridity is expected on climate drainage, and in the cold
   season - a softening.
   In the work we tried to define the monthly average values of air
   temperature in Gyumri in 2030, 2070, 2100, using the extrapolation
   method. The result shows that if the changing process continues, the
   annual average values of air temperature will increase with comparison
   to current normal: in 2030 - 0.09 degrees C (1.37 \%), in 2050 - 0.27
   degrees C (4.12 \%), in 2070 - 0.48 degrees C (7.32 \%), in 2100 - 0.85
   degrees C (13 \%).
   This pattern is also characteristic of other regions of the republic.
   Therefore, it is necessary to implement integrated measures to adapt to
   the effects of air temperature changes and take this into account when
   working out programs for social, environmental and economic development.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present research is to identify the trends in the
   concentrations of few atmospheric pollutants and meteorological
   parameters over an urban station Kolkata (22A degrees 32' N; 88A degrees
   20' E), India, during the period from 2002 to 2011 and subsequently
   develop models for precise forecast of the concentration of the
   pollutants and the meteorological parameters over the station Kolkata.
   The pollutants considered in this study are sulphur dioxide (SO2),
   nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulates of size 10-mu m diameters (PM10),
   carbon monoxide (CO) and tropospheric ozone (O3). The meteorological
   parameters considered are the surface temperature and relative humidity.
   The Mann-Kendall, non-parametric statistical analysis is implemented to
   observe the trends in the data series of the selected parameters. A time
   series approach with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
   modelling is used to provide daily forecast of the parameters with
   precision. ARIMA models of different categories; ARIMA (1, 1, 1), ARIMA
   (0, 2, 2) and ARIMA (2, 1, 2) are considered and the skill of each model
   is estimated and compared in forecasting the concentration of the
   atmospheric pollutants and meteorological parameters. The results of the
   study reveal that the ARIMA (0, 2, 2) is the best statistical model for
   forecasting the daily concentration of pollutants as well as the
   meteorological parameters over Kolkata. The result is validated with the
   observation of 2012.},

Abstract = {Lakes are major repositories of biodiversity, provide multiple ecosystem
   services and are widely recognised as key indicators of environmental
   change. However, studies of lake response to drivers of change at a
   pan-European scale are exceptionally rare. The need for such studies has
   been given renewed impetus by concerns over environmental change and
   because of international policies, such as the EU Water Framework
   Directive (WFD), which impose legal obligations to monitor the condition
   of European lakes towards sustainable systems with good ecological
   status. This has highlighted the need for methods that can be widely
   applied across large spatial and temporal scales and produce comparable
   results. Remote sensing promises much in terms of information provision,
   but the spatial transferability and temporal repeatability of methods
   and relationships observed at individual or regional case studies
   remains unproven at the continental scale. This study demonstrates that
   NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal data are
   capable of producing highly accurate (R-2>0.9) lake surface temperature
   (LST) estimates in lakes with variable hydromorphological
   characteristics and contrasting thermal regimes. Validation of the
   approach using archived AVHRR thermal data for Lake Geneva produced
   observations that were consistent with field data for equivalent time
   periods. This approach provides the basis for generalizing temporal and
   spatial trends in European lake surface temperature over several decades
   and confirms the potential of the full 30 year NOAA AVHRR archive to can
   provide AVHRR-derived LST estimates to help inform European policies on
   lake water quality. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Appraisal of historical trends in maximum and minimum temperature using
   multiple non-parametric techniques over the agriculture-dominated
   Narmada Basin, India},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},

Abstract = {In this study, the long-term trends in climatological parameters, viz.,
   maximum temperature (T-MAX) and minimum temperature (T-MIN), are
   determined over 68 years (i.e., June 1951 to May 2019) using the gridded
   observation datasets (1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution) of India
   Meteorological Department over the Narmada river basin, India. Multiple
   non-parametric techniques, viz., modified Mann-Kendall (MMK), Sen's
   slope (SS), and Spearman's rho (SR) tests, are used to determine
   monthly, seasonal, and annual trends over individual grids. The trends
   are also analyzed for the climatic variables spatially averaged over the
   entire basin to draw general conclusions on historical climate change.
   The results reveal a significant spatiotemporal variation in trends of
   T-MAX and T-MIN over the basin. In general, both the parameters are
   found to be increasing. Furthermore, the hottest months (April and May)
   have become hotter, and the coldest month (January) has become colder,
   implying a higher probability of increasing temperature extremes.
   Furthermore, the entire duration of 68 years is divided into two epochs
   of 34 years, i.e., 1951-1984 and 1985-2018, and the trend analysis of
   T-MAX and T-MIN is also carried out epoch-wise to better
   understand/assess the signals of climate change in recent years. In
   general, a relatively higher warming trend was observed in the latter
   epoch. As a majority of the basin area is dominated by agricultural
   lands, the implications of the temperature trends and their impacts on
   agriculture are succinctly discussed. The information reported in this
   study will be helpful for proper planning and management of water
   resources over the basin under the changing climatic conditions.},

Abstract = {Lakes are known to be the bearers and carriers of any ecosystem. Lakes
   appropriately assist in local weather regulation in a growing urban
   area. But as urban areas expand, these urban lakes continue to shrink,
   and the impact of the urban heat island (UHI) on these lakes continues
   to grow. This paper highlights the impact of land use change on the
   urban lakes of three different climates in West Bengal, India, and their
   role in mitigating the seasonal UHI situation. From 2000 to 2020, the
   urban area and LST in the vicinity of Rabindra Sarobar in Kolkata, Saheb
   bandh in Purulia and Mirik Lake in Darjeeling have been steadily
   increasing. On the other hand, the water and vegetation index have been
   declining in some cases. Also, validating the LST obtained from the
   satellite with the surface temperature shows that the relationship
   between these two elements is quite good. Of these three urban lakes,
   Mirik Lake is the best in overall condition, but Rabindra Sarobar is
   more conserved than the other two lakes. Not only that, the effect of
   LST on the types of land use is most noticeable in settlements and the
   LST increases with distance from wetlands towards the surrounding urban
   area. Even if the weather changes, it is expected that people will save
   these urban lakes in the future for their own needs.},

Title = {Time series decomposition of remotely sensed land surface temperature

   heat islands},

Abstract = {Previous time series methods have difficulties in simultaneous
   characterization of seasonal, gradual, and abrupt changes of remotely
   sensed land surface temperature (LST). This study proposed a model to
   decompose LST time series into trend, seasonal, and noise components.
   The trend component indicates long-term climate change and land
   development and is described as a piecewise linear function with
   iterative breakpoint detection. The seasonal component illustrates
   annual insolation variations and is modeled as a sinusoidal function on
   the detrended data. This model is able to separate the seasonal
   variation in LST from the long-term (including gradual and abrupt)
   change. Model application to nighttime Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/LST time series during 2000-2012 over Beijing
   yielded an overall root-mean-square error of 1.62K between the
   combination of the decomposed trend and seasonal components and the
   actual MODIS/LSTs. LST decreased (similar to -0.086K/yr, p<0.1) in 53\%
   of the study area, whereas it increased with breakpoints in 2009
   (similar to 0.084K/yr before and similar to 0.245K/yr after 2009)
   between the fifth and sixth ring roads. The decreasing trend was
   stronger over croplands than over urban lands (p<0.05), resulting in an
   increasing trend in surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII,
   0.0220.006K/yr). This was mainly attributed to the trends in urban-rural
   differences in rainfall and albedo. The SUHII demonstrated a concave
   seasonal variation primarily due to the seasonal variations of
   urban-rural differences in temperature cooling rate (related to canyon
   structure, vegetation, and soil moisture) and surface heat dissipation
   (affected by humidity and wind).},

Abstract = {Upper stratospheric ozone anomalies from the satellite-borne Solar
   Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SBUV), Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas
   Experiment II (SAGE II), Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), Global
   Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS), and Scanning Imaging
   Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY)
   instruments agree within 5\% or better with ground-based data from
   lidars and microwave radiometers at five stations of the Network for the
   Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), from 45 degrees S
   to 48 degrees N. From 1979 until the late 1990s, all available data show
   a clear decline of ozone near 40 km, by 10\%-15\%. This decline has not
   continued in the last 10 years. At some sites, ozone at 40 km appears to
   have increased since 2000, consistent with the beginning decline of
   stratospheric chlorine. The phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons after the
   International Montreal Protocol in 1987 has been successful, and is now
   showing positive effects on ozone in the upper stratosphere. Temperature
   anomalies near 40 km altitude from European Centre for Medium Range
   Weather Forecast reanalyses (ERA-40), from National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational analyses, and from HALOE and
   lidar measurements show good consistency at the five stations, within
   about 3 K. Since about 1985, upper stratospheric temperatures have been
   fluctuating around a constant level at all five NDACC stations. This
   non-decline of upper stratospheric temperatures is a significant change
   from the more or less linear cooling of the upper stratosphere up until
   the mid-1990s, reported in previous trend assessments. It is also at
   odds with the almost linear 1 K per decade cooling simulated over the
   entire 1979-2010 period by chemistry-climate models (CCMs). The same CCM
   simulations, however, track the historical ozone anomalies quite well,
   including the change of ozone tendency in the late 1990s.},

Abstract = {Studies of ocean temperature and salinity typically focus on global or
   large-scale trends that may not accurately reflect the conditions
   experienced locally by marine organisms. When assessing impacts of
   climate change, it is important to document local conditions, and also
   to focus on the most physiologically stressful time of year. Our goals
   were therefore to (1) characterize long-term trends in sea surface
   temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) experienced by coastal marine
   organisms during the most stressful time of year around Vancouver
   Island; and (2) document variation between east and west coasts of
   Vancouver Island in terms of SST, SSS, and daytime rock surface
   temperatures in the intertidal zone. Over an 82-yr period, from 1935 to
   2016, summertime SST on both coasts increased by 0.67-0.78 degrees C
   (i.e., 0.82-0.97 degrees C per century). Trends in salinity differed
   between coasts: east coast salinity increased by 3.9 while west coast
   salinity decreased by 0.64. Although long-term SST trends are the same
   on both coasts, during the most stressful time of year, east coast
   waters are on average 4.3 degrees C warmer and salinity is 7.8 lower
   than on the west coast. Rock temperature in the mid and upper intertidal
   zone during daytime low tides is 3.9-4.2 degrees C warmer on the east
   coast. Populations of marine organisms inhabiting the coasts of
   Vancouver Island have therefore been experiencing long-term changes in
   abiotic stress, as well as persistent spatial variation in
   climate-related conditions during the most stressful months of the year.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a first overview of the performance of global
   climate models participating in the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison
   Project phase 5 (CMIP5) in simulating the upper troposphere and lower
   stratosphere (UTLS) temperatures. Temperature from CMIP5 models is
   evaluated with high resolution global positioning system radio
   occultation (GPSRO) constellation observing system for meteorology,
   ionosphere, and climate (COSMIC) data during the period of July
   2006-December 2013. Future projections of 17 CMIP5 models based on the
   representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenarios are utilized to
   assess model performance and to identify the biases in the temperature
   in the UTLS region at eight different pressure levels. The evaluations
   were carried out vertically, regionally, and globally to understand the
   temperature uncertainties in CMIP5 models. It is found that the CMIP5
   models successfully reproduce the general features of temperature
   structure in terms of vertical, annual, and inter-annual variation. The
   ensemble mean of CMIP5 models compares well with the COSMIC GPSRO data
   with a mean difference of +/- 1 K. In the tropical region, temperature
   biases vary from one model to another. The spatial difference between
   COSMIC and ensemble mean reveals that at 100 hPa, the models show a bias
   of about +/- 2 K. With increase in altitude the bias decreases and turns
   into a cold bias over the tropical and Antarctic regions. The future
   projections of the CMIP5 models were presented during 2006-2099 under
   the RCP 8.5 scenarios. Projections show a warming trend at 300, 200, and
   100 hPa levels over a wide region of 60A degrees N-45A degrees S. The
   warming decreases rapidly and becomes cooling with increase in altitudes
   by the end of twenty-first century. Significant cooling is observed at
   30, 20, and 10 hPa levels. At 300/10 hPa, the temperature trend
   increases/decreases by similar to 0.82/0.88 K/decade at the end of
   twenty-first century under RCP 8.5 scenarios.},

Abstract = {Empirical porosity/depth trends from the Norwegian Continental Shelf are
   discussed in the light of models on compactional processes during
   burial.  Linear best-fit lines are useful as a first approximation,
   illustrating the general decline in porosity with depth.  Porosity
   increases non-linearly with pore-pressure, and notably higher than
   normal porosity is found in very high overpressure reservoirs. 
   Hydrostatic pressure sandstones from the Haltenbanken area are on
   average more porous than equivalents from the northern Viking Graben. 
   This may be related to the burial history, as generally more subsidence
   occurred in Late Pliocene and Pleistocene in the Haltenbanken basins. 
   The porosity/depth data show considerable scatter, and this is to a
   large degree related to the initial mineralogical composition. 
   Correlated with mineralogical analyses, the reservoir sandstones show a
   trend towards lower porosity with increasing clay content at shallow
   burial, probably due to more extensive mechanical compaction.  At depths
   > 3.0-3.5 km, the porosity loss is highest in sandstones with low clay
   contents.  This may be explained by a lower rate of quartz cementation
   in sandstones with abundant intergranular clays or clay coatings around
   quartz grains.  These data show that pre-burial mineralogy is a very
   important factor in porosity prediction of sandstones, in many cases
   more important than the degree of overpressure.},

Abstract = {With the rapidly changing climate, assessing the global trends of
   cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) attributed to high and low temperatures
   in different climate zones and under varying socio-demographic levels is
   crucial for regulations, preparation, intervention, and clinical
   practice for CVD. Our study included 204 countries with global CVD data
   ranging from 1990 to 2019. We obtained the age-standardized mortality
   rate (ASMR); disability-adjusted life rate of CVD attributed to high,
   low, and non-optimal temperatures; and socio-demographic index (SDI)
   data from the Global Health Data Exchange. We also downloaded the
   temperature data from the Climatic Research Unit. These 204 countries
   were divided into five climate zones and five SDI levels according to
   the annual average temperature data and SDI in 2019. The temporal trends
   of CVD burden attributed to high, low, and non-optimal temperatures were
   estimated by using the cubic regression spline and the generalized
   additive mixed model (GAMM). The total burden of temperature-related CVD
   has been declining in the last 30 years. However, the burden of CVD
   attributed to high temperature showed an increasing trend. Among
   different climate regions, the ASMRs of CVD attributed to high
   temperature were the highest in the tropical regions, followed by
   subtropical regions, and the lowest in the boreal regions. In the past
   30 years, the burden of CVD attributed to high temperatures has shown a
   significant increasing trend, while declining trends are observed for
   non-optimal and low temperatures. The CVD burden attributed to high
   temperatures is particularly pronounced in warmer and low-SDI regions
   with an increasing trend of CVD burden due to high temperature.},

Abstract = {Currently, the satellite Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU/AMSU) datasets
   developed from three organizations-Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), the
   University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH), and the NOAA Center for
   Satellite Applications and Research (STAR)-are often used to monitor the
   global long-term trends of temperatures in the lower troposphere (TLT),
   midtroposphere (TMT), total troposphere (TTT), troposphere and
   stratosphere (TTS), and lower stratosphere (TLS). However, the trend in
   these temperatures over China has not been quantitatively assessed. In
   this study, the decadal variability and longterm trend of upper-air
   temperature during 1979-2018 from three MSU datasets are first evaluated
   over China and compared with the proxy MSU dataset simulated from
   homogenized surface and radiosonde profiles (EQU) at 113 stations in
   China. The regional mean MSU trends over China during 1979-2018 are
   0.22-0.27 (TLT), 0.15-0.22 (TMT), 0.20-0.27 (TTT), 0.02-0.14 (TTS), and
   from 20.33 to 20.36 (TLS) K decade(-1), whereas the EQU trends are 0.31
   (TLT), 0.19 (TMT), 0.24 (TTT), 0.07 (TTS), and 20.26 (TLS) Kdecade(-1).
   The trends from RSS generally show a better agreement with those from
   EQU. The trends from both MSU and EQU exhibit seasonal and regional
   difference with a larger warming in TLT in February and March, and
   stronger cooling in TLS from late winter to spring. The TLT and TMT over
   the Tibetan Plateau and northwestern China show larger warming trends.
   The variability from MSU and EQU agree well except TLT in Tibet and
   southern China. The major difference in regional mean temperatures over
   China between MSU and EQU is related primarily to the satellite
   instrument changes during 1979-98 and the radiosonde system changes in
   China in the 2000s.},

Abstract = {Riverine fishes are sensitive to human-induced changes to their
   ecosystems and have experienced substantial declines in the past
   century. The presence and operation of dams modifies natural flow
   regimes thereby disrupting cues that signal migration and negatively
   influencing habitats critical to riverine fishes. Blue Suckers
   (Cycleptus elongatus) make large annual movements, require large and
   unfragmented reaches of river, and may be sensitive to modifications of
   cues that initiate migration. We assessed the influence of individual
   and abiotic factors on home ranges and movements of 62 transmittered
   Blue Suckers from 2006-2014 in the Missouri River upstream of Fort Peck
   Reservoir in Montana. Populations in this area are disjunct from those
   downstream and are influenced by upstream dam regulation. Blue Suckers
   used large expanses of river with overall home ranges similar to 88
   river kilometers, but these home ranges were about two times smaller
   than reported elsewhere. Increasing discharge and water temperature were
   associated with movement rate and movement probability and cued spawning
   movements of Blue Suckers. Movement rates increased with discharge to
   peak and decreased thereafter. Surprisingly, movement rate and
   probability were highest at the lowest water temperatures we observed
   (similar to 1-58 degrees C) unlike previous studies in other systems
   when peak movement occurred at >= 10 degrees C. Blue Suckers aggregated
   and showed interannual fidelity to several locations during spawning.
   Aggregation and fidelity suggest that optimal spawning areas, which
   exist in tributaries, may be limited within our study area. Our results
   support evidence that riverine fishes require natural trends in
   discharge and water temperature, including occasional flood pulses and
   connectivity among seasonal habitats. The Upper Missouri River retains
   pseudonatural discharge and temperature regimes that elicit responses of
   Blue Sucker to environmental cues, but other rivers may not. Preserving
   or restoring these features, and entire riverscapes, would maintain
   natural environmental cues and habitats required by riverine fishes to
   complete their life histories.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Remsberg and Deaver ( 2005) reported on multiple linear regression
   ( MLR) analyses of time series of middle-atmosphere temperature versus
   pressure ( or T( p)) profiles from the Halogen Occultation Experiment
   (HALOE) for its seasonal and longer-period cycles. Their results are
   extended herein to just over 14 years and updated to properly account
   for the effects of autocorrelation in their time series of zonally
   averaged data. The updated seasonal and annual average terms are
   provided, and they can be used to generate near-global, temperature
   distributions from 2 to 0.007 hPa that are representative of the period
   1991 - 2005. Quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO-like; 853-day) and
   subbiennial (640-day) terms are also resolved and provided, and they
   exhibit good consistency across the range of latitudes and pressure
   altitudes. Further, somewhat exploratory analyses of the residuals from
   each of the 208 time series yield significant 11-year solar cycle ( or
   SC-like) and linear trend terms at a number of latitudes and levels.
   Where significant, those terms are included in the final MLR models. The
   amplitudes of the SC-like terms for the mesosphere agree reasonably with
   calculations of the direct solar radiative effects for T( p). Those
   SC-like amplitudes increase by about a factor of 2 from the lower to the
   upper mesosphere and are larger at the middle than at the low latitudes.
   The diagnosed T( p) cooling trends from HALOE for the low latitudes are
   in the range of - 0.5 to - 1.0 K/decade, which is in good agreement with
   the findings from models of the radiative effects on pressure surfaces
   due to known increases in atmospheric CO2. The diagnosed HALOE trends
   are somewhat larger than those predicted with models for middle
   latitudes of the upper mesosphere. Cooling trends also are found to be
   increasing from about - 0.5 to - 1.0 K/decade from 1 to 2 hPa of the
   upper stratosphere, also in reasonable agreement with modeled results.},

Abstract = {Seasonal subsurface temperature monitoring, which exploits the fact that
   increased seepage flow may locally alter the temperature distribution,
   is a useful approach for leakage monitoring and evaluation within
   embankment dams and their foundations. At the Mactaquac Generating
   Station, New Brunswick, Canada, spatial and temporal variations of
   temperature have been monitored and modelled at the steeply inclined
   interface between the compacted clay till core of the embankment dam and
   an abutting concrete diversion sluiceway. Over a 4-year period, two
   seasonally recurring anomalies at different depths were observed by
   fibre optic distributed temperature sensing in the concrete structure
   close to the interface. A 3D coupled flow and heat transport model was
   developed in FEFLOW to simulate temperature distribution within the dam
   resulting from seasonal variations in air and reservoir temperature.
   Leakage zones near the interface were simulated in the concrete and
   embankment. At a depth of 13 m below the crest, the significant lag time
   between temperature variations in the reservoir and dam core shows that
   the leakage responsible for an observed temperature anomaly must be
   limited to enhanced flow within the concrete. At much shallower depths,
   where seasonal reservoir and dam core temperatures fluctuate nearly in
   phase, seepage paths are more challenging to determine.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {We present a novel quasi-Bayesian method to weight multiple dynamical
   models by their skill at capturing both potentially non-linear trends
   and first-order autocorrelated variability of the underlying process,
   and to make weighted probabilistic projections. We validate the method
   using a suite of one-at-a-time cross-validation experiments involving
   Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), its
   temperature-based index, as well as Korean summer mean maximum
   temperature. In these experiments the method tends to exhibit superior
   skill over a trend-only Bayesian model averaging weighting method in
   terms of weight assignment and probabilistic forecasts. Specifically,
   mean credible interval width, and mean absolute error of the projections
   tend to improve. We apply the method to a problem of projecting summer
   mean maximum temperature change over Korea by the end of the 21 st
   century using a multi-model ensemble. Compared to the trend-only method,
   the new method appreciably sharpens the probability distribution
   function (pdf) and increases future most likely, median, and mean
   warming in Korea. The method is flexible, with a potential to improve
   forecasts in geosciences and other fields.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal trends in normal-fault segmentation recorded by
   low-temperature thermochronology: Livingstone fault scarp, Malawi Rift,
   East African Rift System},
Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {455},
Pages = {62-72},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The evolution of through-going normal-fault arrays from initial
   nucleation to growth and subsequent interaction and mechanical linkage
   is well documented in many extensional provinces. Over time, these
   processes. lead to predictable spatial and temporal variations in the
   amount and rate of displacement accumulated along strike of individual
   fault segments, which should be manifested in the patterns of footwall
   exhumation.
   Here, we investigate the along-strike and vertical distribution of
   low-temperature apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) cooling ages along the bounding
   fault system, the Livingstone fault, of the Karonga Basin of the
   northern Malawi Rift. The fault evolution and linkage from rift
   initiation to the present day has been previously constrained through
   investigations of the hanging wall basin fill. The new cooling ages from
   the footwall of the Livingstone fault can be related to the adjacent
   depocentre evolution and across a relay zone between two palaeo-fault
   segments. Our data are complimented by published apatite fission track
   (AFT) data and reveal significant variation in rock cooling history
   along-strike: the centre of the footwall yields younger cooling ages
   than the former tips of earlier fault segments that are now linked. This
   suggests that low-temperature thermochronology can detect fault
   interactions along strike. That these former segment boundaries are
   preserved within exhumed footwall rocks is a function of the relatively
   recent linkage of the system.
   Our study highlights that changes in AHe (and potentially AFT) ages
   associated with the along-strike displacement profile can occur over
   relatively short horizontal distances (of a few kilometres). This is
   fundamentally important in the assessment of the vertical cooling
   history of footwalls in extensional systems: temporal differences in the
   rate of tectonically driven exhumation at a given location along fault
   strike may be of greater importance in controlling changes in rates of
   vertical exhumation than commonly invoked climatic fluctuations. (C)

Abstract = {Habitat loss and climate change are key drivers of global biodiversity
   declines but their relative importance has rarely been examined. We
   attempted to attribute spatially divergent population trends of two
   Afro-Palaearctic migrant warbler species, Willow Warbler Phylloscopus
   trochilus and Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita, to changes in
   breeding grounds climate or habitat. We used bird counts from over 4000
   sites across the UK between 1994 and 2017, monitored as part of the
   BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey. We modelled Willow Warbler and
   Common Chiffchaff population size and growth in relation to habitat,
   climate and weather. We then used the abundance model coefficients and
   observed environmental changes to determine the extent to which
   spatially varying population trends in England and Scotland were
   consistent with attribution to climate and habitat changes. Both
   species' population size and growth correlated with habitat, climate and
   weather on their breeding grounds. Changes in habitat, in particular
   woodland expansion, could be linked to small population increases for
   both species in England and Scotland. Both species' populations
   correlated more strongly with climate than weather, and both had an
   optimum breeding season temperature: 11 degrees C for Willow Warbler and
   around 13.5 degrees C for Common Chiffchaff (with marginally different
   predictions from population size and growth models). Breeding ground
   temperature increases, therefore, had the potential to have caused some
   of the observed Willow Warbler declines in England (where the mean
   breeding season temperature was 12.7 degrees C) and increases in
   Scotland (mean breeding season temperature was 10.2 degrees C), and some
   of the differential rates of increase for Common Chiffchaff. However,
   much of the variation in species' population abundance and trends were
   not well predicted by our models and could be due to other factors, such
   as species interactions, habitat and climate change in their wintering
   grounds and on migration. This study provides evidence that the effect
   of climate change on a species may vary spatially and may switch from
   being beneficial to being detrimental if a temperature threshold is

Abstract = {The technique of the Rayleigh lidar provides temperature profiles with a
   good temporal and vertical resolution in the middle atmosphere. Data
   obtained by 2 Rayleigh lidars set up at the Observatory of
   Haute-Provence (44-degrees-N, 6-degrees-E) and at Biscarrosse
   (44-degrees-N, 1-degrees-W) from 1978 to 1989 led to a unique set of
   data of 1200 night-mean temperature profiles from 37 to 87 km. A
   climatology of the temperature over the south of France has been
   established from this data base and new results concerning both the
   short-term and long-term variability of the middle atmosphere are
   presented in this paper. The observed temperature around 44-degrees-N,
   0-degrees-W is in general colder than the mean temperature given in the
   COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere (1986) near 75 km and warmer
   above 80 km. A clear semi-annual variation is observed near 65 km with
   maxima occurring just after the equinoxes. The study of the short-term
   variability indicates clearly two frequency domains: long periods below
   65 km with a maximum in December-January which relate to planetary waves
   and shorter periods above 65 km induced by the breaking of gravity
   waves. A correlation with the 11-year solar cycle, negative in the
   stratosphere and positive in the mesosphere, is found to be well above
   the 95\% confidence level with an amplitude larger in winter than in
   summer. However, with only 11 years of data it is obviously difficult to
   conclude that this atmospheric perturbation is induced by the solar
   forcing. A cooling of the mesosphere of about -4 K/decade at 60-70 km is
   found but is at the limit of the 95\% confidence level, whereas we do
   not observe any significant trend in the stratosphere.},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The Neogene Vienna Basin (VB) is a major hydrocarbon province with a
   long history of exploration accumulating extensive stratigraphic and
   structural information from numerous seismic and drilling programs.
   Based on the quantitative analysis of hundreds of foraminiferal samples
   from 52 drillings, we present the first continuous reconstruction of
   paleoenvironmental evolution of the VB from the early Miocene to the
   middle Miocene spanning 6.4 million years. Our analyses comprise
   reconstructions of sea surface temperature (SST), bottom water
   temperature (BWT), salinity, trophic levels, stress indicators, mode of
   life, feeding preferences and diversity indices (Fisher a, dominance and
   equitability) based on the transfer function for foraminifers of
   Hohenegger (2005, Palaeogeogr. Palaeoclimatol. Palaeoecol. 217, 115-130)
   and applied statistics (e.g. box plots and ternary diagrams). Bottom
   water temperatures indicate a cooling during the early and middle
   Badenian (Langhian), which seemingly contradicts the global warming of
   the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) and a subsequent warming,
   which contrasts the expected trend following the cooling of the Middle
   Miocene Climatic Transition. Both trends are discussed as result of
   bathymetric evolution of the VB and intense upwelling during the early
   and middle Badenian. Repetitive alternations of Orbulina-rich
   assemblages, indicating a warm and stratified waterbody, with
   globigerinid-dominated assemblages, indicating upwelling and high
   productivity, are discussed in the light of a yet undescribed waxing and
   waning of upwelling intensity on a decadal to millennial scale. The
   applied formula for SST-calculations seems to underestimate real
   temperatures. Nevertheless, it reveals a distinct warming of about 3
   degrees C from the early to the middle Miocene. In contrast to previous
   interpretations, we document normal marine conditions from the
   Ottnangian to the Sarmatian (middle Burdigalian to Serravallian) with a
   slight increase in salinity during the late Sarmatian.},

Abstract = {Friction stir welding (FSW) process became a game changer for welding of
   aluminium in a considerably short span of time. Researchers are tempted
   to use this method on another materials due to of its excellent after
   FSW weld properties. In fact, researchers and industrial engineers of
   sectors like automobile and aerospace, where weight is a sensitive
   issue, feel the need of such a remarkable operation which gives us the
   best results without any defects in the weld of the material whose
   softening temperature is high. FSW of nonferrous materials like Ti 6Al
   4V-which have high strength and high softening temperature-has become
   the hottest subject for further research due to its progressing use in
   the aviation industry. FSW experiments on such materials are tedious and
   expensive. The achievement of the accurate plasticized stage is very
   much essential so that the tool can travel in traverse direction
   flawlessly without damage to achieve sound weld. To get insight of such
   tedious process as well as to save cost, numerical simulation and
   computational modelling is the best known option to solve the above
   problems. In this study, Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) formulation
   is used to create 3D coupled temperature-displacement FSW model, in
   which the workpiece domain is described by the combine Eulerian and
   Lagrangian boundaries and the tool domain by the Lagrangian boundaries.
   The contrast with experimental results shows that the peak temperature
   and the temperature distribution are well predicted by the CEL model.
   Further, the repercussions of the difference in tool travel speeds and
   tool rotational speeds shows significant changes on the temperature
   distribution. The elimination of mesh distortion within the workpiece
   doesn't affect the reliability of the results predicted by the present
   CEL model and has good potential within the finite element modelling of
   refill friction stir welding. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Impacts of land use land cover on temperature trends over the
   continental United States: assessment using the North American Regional
   Reanalysis},

Abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of surface temperature trends to land use
   land cover change (LULC) over the conterminous United States (CONUS)
   using the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) approach. We estimated the
   OMR trends for the 1979-2003 period from the US Historical Climate
   Network (USHCN), and the NCEP-NCAR North American Regional Reanalysis
   (NARR). We used a new mean square differences (MSDs)-based assessment
   for the comparisons between temperature anomalies from observations and
   interpolated reanalysis data. Trends of monthly mean temperature
   anomalies show a strong agreement, especially between adjusted USHCN and
   NARR (r = 0.9 on average) and demonstrate that NARR captures the climate
   variability at different time scales.
   OMR trend results suggest that, unlike findings from studies based on
   the global reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR reanalysis), NARR often has a larger
   warming trend than adjusted observations (on average, 0.28 and 0.27
   degrees C/decade respectively). OMR trends were found to be sensitive to
   land cover types. We analysed decadal OMR trends as a function of land
   types using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and new
   National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 1992-2001 Retrofit Land Cover
   Change. The magnitude of OMR trends obtained from the NLDC is larger
   than the one derived from the `static' AVHRR. Moreover, land use
   conversion often results in more warming than cooling.
   Overall, our results confirm the robustness of the OMR method for
   detecting non-climatic changes at the station level, evaluating the
   impacts of adjustments performed on raw observations, and most
   importantly, providing a quantitative estimate of additional warming
   trends associated with LULC changes at local and regional scales. As
   most of the warming trends that we identify can be explained on the
   basis of LULC changes, we suggest that in addition to considering the
   greenhouse gases-driven radiative forcings, multi-decadal and longer
   climate models simulations must further include LULC changes. Copyright

Abstract = {In this study, trends of annual and seasonal surface air temperature
   time series were examined for 20 stations in Greece for the period 1955
   - 2001, and satellite data for the period 1980 - 2001. Two statistical
   tests based on the least square method and one based on the Mann-Kendall
   test, which is also capable of detecting the starting year of possible
   climatic discontinuities or changes, were used for the analysis. Greece,
   in general, shows a cooling trend in winter for the period 1955 - 2001,
   whereas, summer shows an overall warming trend, however, neither is
   statistically significant. As a result, the overall trend of the annual
   values is nearly zero. Comparison with corresponding trends in the
   Northern Hemisphere (NH) shows that temperatures in Greece do not follow
   the intense warming trends. Satellite data indicate a remarkable warming
   trend in mean annual, winter and summer in Greece for the period 1980 -
   2001, and a slight warming trend in annual, spring and autumn for the
   NH. Comparison with the respective trends detected in the surface air
   temperature for the same period ( 1980 - 2001) shows they match each
   other quite well in both Greece and the NH. The relationship between
   temperature variability in Greece and atmospheric circulation was also
   examined using correlation analysis with three circulation indices: the
   well-known North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), a Mediterranean
   Oscillation Index (MOI) and a new Mediterranean Circulation Index (MCI).
   The MOI and MCI indices show the most interesting correlation with
   winter temperatures in Greece. The behaviour of pressure and the height
   of the 500 hPa surface over the Mediterranean region supports these
   results.},

Abstract = {This document discusses the hydrogen combustion flame with a special
   focus on the flame velocity profile in relationship to combustion
   pressure and temperature. First, the chemistry associated with hydrogen
   combustion is discussed along with the important factors that affect the
   hydrogen flame. Then some of the models for hydrogen flame velocity are
   discussed. Computational analysis is performed to determine the trend of
   the flame velocity profile in relation to pressure and temperature above
   and below the adiabatic temperature point. Twelve test cases, made of
   combinations of pressure and temperature variations, are used to monitor
   the trend of the velocity profile when the temperature was under the
   adiabatic temperature point and when it was above the adiabatic
   temperature point. It is shown that increasing pressure or temperature,
   or both, always increased the flame velocity, which is consistent with
   the physics law. However, this study demonstrated that below the
   hydrogen adiabatic point, the hydrogen flame average velocity was much
   more responsive; it increased more than 9 times than when the
   temperature was above the adiabatic point; it only increased about 5
   times. This was observed over the same range of applied pressure and the
   same range of applied temperature. A physics-based explanation is
   presented for this trend by considering the kinetic energies associated
   with the hydrogen species above and below the adiabatic point and the
   completeness of the combustion. It is also found that the peak velocity
   profile took place at around 40\% of hydrogen concentration. (c) 2021

Title = {Contribution of stratospheric warmings to temperature trends in the
   middle atmosphere from the lidar series obtained at Haute-Provence
   Observatory (44°N)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},

Abstract = {This study describes a method to calculate long-term temperature trends,
   as an alternative to the ones based on monthly mean temperatures, which
   are highly impacted by the high winter variability partially due to
   wave-mean flow interactions like Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSW).
   This method avoids the strong influence of SSWs and provides
   ``background{''} temperature trend estimates which are in better
   agreement with expected direct radiative effects. The data set used
   results from lidar measurements - performed above southern France
   continuously since late 1978 - combined with radiosonde profiles. With
   this new methodology, the long-term trends during winter at 40 km shows
   a larger cooling per decade (-2 +/- 0.4 K) than when the mean
   temperature is used (-0.4 +/- 0.4 K). The background temperature trend
   is closer to the summer trend estimates which are similar whatever the
   temperature proxy used, due to the absence of SSWs (-2.9 +/- 0.3 K per
   decade with the mean-based method and -3.4 +/- 0.3 K per decade with the
   background-based calculation). Based on this background temperature,
   composite evolutions of winter anomalies for both vortex-displacement
   and vortex-splitting major SSWs have been displayed: in both cases the
   largest warming occurs at the time of the SSW in the upper stratosphere,
   with mean amplitudes of more than 10 K. A warm signal in the upper
   mesosphere could suggest a potential precursory role of gravity waves.
   Displacement-type events present an 18-day periodicity, which is a clear
   sign of the wave number one Rossby wave. Colder tropospheric
   temperatures are noticed before and during the SSW, and warmer ones
   after the event, with a stronger signal for split-type events.},

Abstract = {In some areas of the world, regional climate change is in good agreement
   with global climate change. This study brings new information about what
   defines climate change in the contact area of Adriatic Sea and
   Southeastern Europe, and conclusions arc based on trend analysis of
   annual and seasonal temperatures in the southern and southeastern parts
   of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Trend analysis was applied on mean annual
   surface air temperatures, mean maximum temperatures, and mean minimum
   temperatures of all four seasons. This study used 4 meteorological
   stations: Livno, Bileca, Mostar, and Ivan Sedlo for 56 years. The main
   statistical method is the Mann-Kendall test. The total number of
   analysis is 48. A statistically significant positive trend was
   determined in 36 analysis, while in the rest of the tests this was not
   the case. The highest amount of temperature increase is present in the
   mean maximum summer air temperatures in Livno and Ivan Sedlo. Mean
   minimum autumn air temperatures had the smallest increase. Negative
   trend is present in the mean autumn surface air temperatures and mean
   maximum autumn temperatures. Using a geographical information system
   resulted in visualizing regional differences in the spatial distribution
   of isotherms. The study area has combined the influence of orography and
   maritime effects of the Adriatic Sea. Having in mind these results, the
   growing temperature has been recognized as a problem which needs more
   attention in Bosnia and Herzegovina. tin Unfortunately, official
   documents which propose economic adaptation on climate change in this
   country are not at a satisfactory level.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the trends and variability in
   extreme temperature indices and its impact on rice-wheat productivity
   over two districts of Bihar, India, which is part of the middle
   Indo-Gangetic Basin. Mann-Kendall non-parametric test was employed for
   detection of trend and Sen slope was determined to quantify the
   magnitude of such trends. We have analyzed 10 extreme temperature
   indices for monthly and seasonally. The influence of extreme temperature
   indices on rice-wheat productivity was determined using correlation
   analysis. As far as Patna is concerned, if the number of cool days
   during September a parts per thousand yen10, the rice productivity will
   increase due to the availability of sufficient duration to fill up the
   grain. However, higher warm days during all the months except June will
   affect the productivity. A significant negative correlation was noticed
   between maximum value of minimum temperature during September and rice
   productivity. Highly significant positive correlation was noticed
   between number of cool days during September with rice productivity
   while it was highly significant negative correlation in the case of
   number of warm days during the same month. As far as Samastipur is
   concerned, a negative correlation was noticed between wheat productivity
   and maximum value of maximum temperature (TXx) during February, but not
   statistically significant. The higher temperature may affect the kernel
   weight and thereby yield. It is seen that a critical value of TXx a
   parts per thousand yen29.2 A degrees C will be harmful to wheat crop
   during February. A significant positive correlation of number of cool
   nights with wheat productivity also supports the above relationship. The
   critical values of extreme temperature indices during rice and wheat
   growing months provide an indicator to assess the vulnerability of
   rice-wheat productivity to temperature for Patna and Samastipur
   districts and there is a need to prepare an adaptive strategy and also
   develop thermo-insensitive rice-wheat high yielding varieties suitable
   for this region to sustain rice-wheat productivity under projected
   climate change situation.},

Title = {Effect of exclusion of anomalous tropical stations on temperature trends
   from a 63-station radiosonde network, and comparison with other analyses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {16},
Number = {13},
Pages = {2288-2295},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {A 63-station radiosonde network has been used for many years to estimate
   temperature variations and trends at the surface and in the 850-300-,
   300-100-, and 100-50-mb layers of climate zones, both hemispheres, and
   the globe, but with little regard for the quality of individual station
   data. In this paper, nine tropical radiosonde stations in this network
   are identified as anomalous based on unrepresentatively large
   standard-error-of-regression values for 300-100-mb trends for the period
   1958-2000. In the Tropics the exclusion of the 9 anomalous stations from
   the 63-station network for 1958-2000 results in a warming of the
   300-100-mb layer rather than a cooling, a doubling of the warming of the
   850-300-mb layer to a value of 0.13 K decade(-1), and a greater warming
   at 850-300-mb than at the surface. The global changes in trend are
   smaller, but include a change to the same warming of the surface and the
   850-300-mb layer during 1958-2000. The effect of the station exclusions
   is much less for 1979-2000, suggesting that most of the data problems
   are before this time. Temperature trends based on the 63-station network
   are compared with the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and other radiosonde
   trends, and agreement is better after the exclusion of the anomalous
   stations. There is consensus that in the Tropics the troposphere has
   warmed slightly more than the surface during 1958-2000, but that there
   has been a warming of the surface relative to the troposphere during
   1979-2000. Globally, the warming of the surface and the troposphere are
   essentially the same during 1958-2000, but during 1979-2000 the surface
   warms more than the troposphere. During the latter period the
   radiosondes indicate considerably more low-stratospheric cooling in the
   Tropics than does the MSU.},

Title = {Temporal trends in canopy temperature and greenness are potential
   indicators of late-season drought avoidance and functional stay-green in
   wheat},
Journal = {FIELD CROPS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {274},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The ability to avoid dehydration is a drought resistance mechanism
   becoming increasingly more important even in temperate regions. In
   wheat, dehydration avoidance can be associated with a maintained canopy
   cooling during dry periods. However, in an average year under temperate
   conditions, drought periods are rather short which makes it difficult to
   routinely screen for drought avoidance using canopy temperature (CT).
   Furthermore, confounding factors such as differences in height, shoot
   biomass, canopy structure and phenology complicate the interpretation of
   differences in CT. We aimed to use temporal trends in CT and canopy
   greenness during shortterm drought and heat events in the early grain
   filling phase to circumvent these problems. During this phase,
   evaporative demand is high and phenology-driven senescence has yet
   little effect on CT. Diverse sets of 354 and 71 wheat genotypes where
   grown in the field phenotyping platform of ETH Zurich in 2018 and 2019,
   respectively. CT was repeatedly measured during early grain filling by
   means of drone-based imaging. The temporal trends in CT during early
   grain filling showed a moderate to high within-year heritability (h2 =
   0.35 and h2 = 0.88 in 2018 and 2019, respectively). These trends were
   largely independent of confounding factors when compared to single time
   point measurements and likely represent genotype-specific reactions to
   decreasing water availability more directly than absolute CT. CT trends
   were also largely independent of the temporal trends in stay-green
   indices. Therefore, we used a combination of time-resolved CT and
   stay-green trends to identify genotypes combining both traits.
   Significant differences were observed in the combined time-resolved
   index among three replicated check varieties. We therefore propose to
   use the combined time-resolved index to identify genotypes with improved
   drought avoidance and functional stay green.},

Abstract = {In many animal population survey studies, the construction of a
   stochastic model provides an effective way to capture underlying
   biological characteristics that contribute to the overall variation in
   the data. In this paper we develop a stochastic model to assess the
   population trend and abundance of the Florida manatee, Trichechus
   manatus latirostris, along the Atlantic coast of the state, using aerial
   survey data collected at winter aggregation sites between 1982 and 2001.
   This model accounts for the method by which the manatees were counted,
   their movements between surveys, and the behavior of the total
   population over time. The data suggest an overall increase in the
   population from 1982 to 1989 of around 5\%-7\%, a reduction in growth or
   a leveling off (0\%-4\% annual growth) from 1990 to 1993, and then an
   increase again of around 3\%-6\% since 1994. In winter 2001-2002 (the
   most recent survey season for which analyses were done), we estimated
   the adult manatee population along the east coast of Florida to be 1,607
   individuals (range = 1,353-1,972; 95\% credible interval). Our estimate
   of manatee abundance corresponds well with maximum counts (approximately
   1,600 manatees) produced during synoptic aerial surveys under optimal
   conditions. Our calculations of trends correspond well with mark and
   recapture analyses of trends in survival of adult manatees along the
   east coast through the early 1990s. Our population trend estimates since
   that time are more optimistic than those generated by mark-recapture
   models.},

Title = {The Long-Term Trends of Nocturnal Mesopause Temperature and Altitude

Abstract = {The mesopause, a boundary between mesosphere and thermosphere with the
   coldest atmospheric temperature, is formed mainly by the combining
   effects of radiative cooling of CO2, and the vertical adiabatic flow in
   the upper atmosphere. A continuous multidecade (1990-2018) nocturnal
   temperature data base of an advanced Na lidar, obtained at Fort Collins,
   CO (41 degrees N, 105 degrees W), and at Logan, UT (42 degrees N, 112
   degrees W), provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term
   variations of this important atmospheric boundary. In this study, we
   categorize the lidar-observed mesopause into two categories: the high
   mesopause (HM) above 97 km during nonsummer months, mainly formed
   through the radiative cooling, and the low mesopause (LM) below 92 km
   during nonwinter months, generated mostly by the adiabatic cooling.
   These lidar observations reveal a cooling trend of more than 2 K/decade
   in absolute mesopause temperature since 1990, along with a decreasing
   trend in mesopause height: The HM is moving downward at a speed of 450
   90 m/decade, while the LM has a slower downward trend of 130 160
   m/decade. However, since 2000, while the height trend (- 470 160
   m/decade for the HM and 150 290 m/decade for the LM) is consistent, the
   temperature trend becomes statistically insignificant (- 0.2 +/- 0.7
   K/decade and -1 +/- 0.9 K/decade for the HM and the LM, respectively). A
   long-term study by Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with
   thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) also indicated the
   similar mesopause changes, mostly caused by stratosphere-lower
   mesosphere cooling and contraction.},

Abstract = {In this work an experimental and theoretical study on the formation of
   HSO2+ ion from the SO2++CH4 and SO2++H2O ion-molecule reactions at
   different temperatures is reported. Tunable synchrotron radiation was
   used to produce the SO2+ ion in excited ro-vibrational levels of the
   ionic ground state X(2)A(1) and mass spectrometry was employed to
   identify the product ions. Calculations in the frame of the density
   functional theory and variational transition state theory were combined
   to explore the dynamics of the reactions. The experimental results show
   that HSO2+ is the only product in both reactions. Its yield decreases
   monotonically with photon energy in the SO2++H2O reaction, while it
   decreases at first and then increases in the SO2++CH4 reaction. Theory
   confirms this trend by calculating the rate constants at different
   temperatures and explains the results by means of the polar, spin and
   charge effects as well as structural reorganization occurring in the
   reaction coordinate. The dynamic behavior observed in these two
   reactions is of general and fundamental interest. It can also provide
   some insights on the role of these reactions in astrochemistry as well
   as in their use as models for bond-activation reactions.},

Title = {Evolution of temperature-attributable mortality trends looking at social
   inequalities: An observational case study of urban maladaptation to cold
   and heat},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {214},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: To date, little is known about the temporal variation of the
   temperature-mortality association among different demographic and
   socio-economic groups. The aim of this work is to investigate trends in
   cold-and heat -attributable mortality risk and burden by sex, age,
   education, marital status, and number of household occupants in the city
   of Turin, Italy.Methods: We collected daily time-series of temperature
   and mortality counts by demographic and socio-economic groups for the
   period 1982-2018 in Turin. We applied standard quasi-Poisson regression
   models to data subsets of 25-year moving subperiods, and we estimated
   the temperature-mortality associations with distributed lag non-linear
   models (DLNM). We provided cross-linkages between the evolution of
   minimum mortality temperatures, relative risks of mortality and
   temperature-attributable deaths under cold and hot conditions.Results:
   Our findings highlighted an overall increase in risk trends under cold
   and heat conditions. All-cause mortality at the 1st percentile increased
   from 1.15 (95\% CI: 1.04; 1.28) in 1982-2006 to 1.24 (95\% CI: 1.11;
   1.38) in 1994-2018, while at the 99th percentile the risk shifted from
   1.51 (95\% CI: 1.41; 1.61) to 1.59 (95\% CI: 1.49; 1.71). In relation to
   social differences, women were characterized by greater values in
   respect to men, and similar estimates were observed among the elderly in
   respect to the youngest subgroup. Risk trends by educa-tional subgroups
   were mixed, according to the reference temperature condition. Finally,
   individuals living in conditions of isolation were characterized by
   higher risks, with an increasing vulnerability throughout
   time.Conclusions: The overall increase in cold-and heat-related
   mortality risk suggests a maladaptation to ambient temperatures in
   Turin. Despite alert systems in place increase public awareness and
   improve the efficiency of existing health services at the local level,
   they do not necessarily prevent risks in a homogeneous way. Targeted
   public health responses to cold and heat in Turin are urgently needed to
   adapt to extreme temperatures due to climate change.},

Title = {Evaluating global and regional land warming trends in the past decades
   with both MODIS and ERA5-Land land surface temperature data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {280},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Global surface temperature has been setting new record highs in the
   recent decades, imposing increasing environmental challenges for
   societies and ecosystems worldwide. Global warming rates of the 20th
   century have been documented by a number of studies, nevertheless, the
   warming rates in the most recent decades in the 21st century are of
   particular interest for understanding the ongoing climate change.
   Analyzing temperature trends demands data with high spatial resolution
   and broad geographical coverage to allow for analyzing trends and
   changes on a regional scale. Land Surface Temperature data from NASA
   MODIS with global resolution of 0.05 \& DEG; and Skin Temperature data
   from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
   ERA5-Land reanalysis with global resolution of 0.1 fulfill these
   demands. In this study, we analyze the remote-sensing -based MODIS data
   to estimate land surface temperature change rates over the period
   2001-2020 in global, continental, and pixel-wise scales with statistical
   significance indicated. The model-based ERA5-Land data are also analyzed
   in parallel, extending the period of analysis back to 1981. These two
   independently-sourced datasets, one from satellites above the atmosphere
   and one from combining surface modeling and observations, are shown to
   produce highly consistent results. It is revealed that the trends in the
   shorter period 2001-2020 are spatially conforming to the trends in the
   longer period 1981-2020 despite the shorter time length. For the period
   2001-2020, we show that the global average land surface temperature rate
   of change was 0.26 -0.34 C per decade, with substantially different
   warming rates in different regions. The Arctic, Europe, and Russia show
   statistically significant warming in both datasets. The Arctic, in
   particular, warmed at a rate 2.5-2.8 times the global average, and data
   in the 40-year period 1981-2020 suggest that warming is accelerating in
   almost all the continents or large regions. Most noticeably, the two
   independent datasets both indicate that Arctic permafrost regions had
   the world's highest warming rate at the onset of the 21st century,
   reaching > 2 ? per decade in some areas.},

Abstract = {The difference in temperature trend for the 20-year period 1979-1998 and
   40-year period 1959-1998 is estimated from a 63-station global
   radiosonde network. The variability of radiosonde-station temperature
   trends, as measured by their standard deviation, is about twice as great
   for 1979-1998 as 1959-1998. The cooling trend in the 100-50 mb layer of
   the low stratosphere is similar in polar, temperate and tropical zones,
   and about twice as great during 1979-1998 as 1959-1998. The cooling
   trend in the 300-100 mb layer of extratropics is also greater during
   1979-1998 than 1959-1998, but the slight tropical warming is almost the
   same for the 2 periods. The warming trend in the tropospheric 850-300 mb
   layer is similar during 1959-1998 and 1979-1998, except in the south
   temperate zone where there is indicated to be cooling during 1979-1998.
   At the surface of the north polar zone the warming trend during
   1979-1998 is nearly 3 times the warming during 1959-1998. In the global
   average the surface and 850-300 mb warmings are the same during
   1959-1998, but the surface warms relative to the 850-300 mb layer during
   1979-1998.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We present midlatitude solar response and linear trend from Colorado
   State University/Utah State University Na lidar nocturnal temperature
   observations between 1990 and 2017. Along with the nightly mean
   temperatures (\_Ngt), we also use the corresponding 2-hr means centered
   at midnight (\_2MN), resulting in vertical trend profiles similar in
   shapes as those previously published. The 28-year trend from \_Ngt
   (\_2MN) data set starts from a small warming at 85 km, to cooling at 87
   (88) km, reaching a maximum of 1.85 +/- 0.53 (1.09 +/- 0.74) at 92 (93)
   km and turns positive again at 102 (100) km. The 6-month winter trend is
   much cooler than the 4-month summer trend with comparable solar response
   varying around 5 +/- 1 K/100 SFU throughout the profile (85-105 km) with
   higher summer values. We explore the observed summer/winter trend
   difference in terms of observed gravity wave heat flux heating rate at a
   nearby station and the long-term trend of gravity wave variance at a
   midlatitude. Between 89 and 100 km, the lidar trends are within the
   error bars of the Leibniz Middle Atmosphere (LIMA) summer trends
   (1979-2013), which are nearly identical to the lidar-Ngt trend. We
   address the need of long data set for reliable analysis on trend, the
   extent of trend uncertainty due to possible tidal bias, the effect of a
   Pinatubo/episodic function, and the impact of stratospheric ozone
   recovery.},

Title = {The signature of ozone depletion on tropical temperature trends, as

   forcings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {The effect of ozone depletion on temperature trends in the tropical
   lower stratosphere is explored with an atmospheric general circulation
   model, and directly contrasted to the effect of increased greenhouse
   gases and warmer sea surface temperatures. Confirming and extending
   earlier studies we find that, over the second half of the 20th Century,
   the model's lower-stratospheric cooling caused by ozone depletion is
   several times larger than that induced by increasing greenhouse gases.
   Moreover, our model suggests that the response to different forcings is
   highly additive. Finally we demonstrate that when ozone depletion alone
   is prescribed in the model, the seasonal cycle of the resultant cooling
   trends in the lower stratosphere is quite similar to that recently
   reported in satellite and radiosonde observations: this constitutes
   strong, new evidence for the key role of ozone depletion on tropical
   lower-stratospheric temperature trends.},

Title = {An assessment of the role of homogenization protocol in the performance

Abstract = {This paper gives the complete details of the protocols applied for
   developing a spatially and temporarily high-resolution dataset of
   temperature for northeastern Spain. Our methodologies used data from a
   large number of observatories (1583) spanning some portions of the
   period between 1900 and 2006. The raw dataset was first tested for
   internal and external consistency to check data quality. To improve data
   completeness, a linear regression model was then utilized to infill gaps
   in the daily temperature series using the best correlated data from
   nearby sites. Discontinuities in the reconstructed series were
   determined by combining the results of three homogeneity-relative tests:
   the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT), the Eastrerling and
   Peterson two-phased regression method and the Vincent test. To assess
   the possible impact of data homogenisation on trends and statistical
   properties of the final series, a set of tests (e. g. semivariance
   models and L-moment statistics) was applied to the series before and
   after correction. Semivariance models suggest a significant improvement
   in the spatial dependence of the corrected dataset on both seasonal and
   annual timescales. Also, L-moments gave no evidence of significant
   changes in the probability distribution of daily temperature series
   after correction. Taken together, the newly compiled dataset seems to be
   more robust and reveals more coherent spatial and temporal patterns of
   temperature compared with the original dataset. From the temporal and
   spatial perspectives, the new dataset comprises the most complete
   register of temperature in northeast Spain (1900-2006), with a
   reasonably spatial coverage. Accordingly, this database can provide a
   more reliable base for studying temperature changes and variability in
   the region. This dataset can also be of particular relevance to a number
   of meteorological, ecological, hydrological and agricultural
   applications on local, regional and continental scales. Copyright (C)

Title = {Identification of Existing Challenges and Future Trends for the

Abstract = {Decarbonization of the industrial sector is one of the most important
   keys to reducing global warming. Energy demands and associated emissions
   in the industrial sector are continuously increasing. The utilization of
   high temperature heat pumps (HTHPs) operating with natural fluids
   presents an environmentally friendly solution with great potential to
   increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions in industrial processes.
   Ammonia-water absorption-compression heat pumps (ACHPs) combine the
   technologies of an absorption and vapor compression heat pump using a
   zeotropic mixture of ammonia and water as working fluid. The given
   characteristics, such as the ability to achieve high sink temperatures
   with comparably large temperature lifts and high coefficient of
   performance (COP) make the ACHP interesting for utilization in various
   industrial high temperature applications. This work reviews the state of
   technology and identifies existing challenges based on conducted
   experimental investigations. In this context, 23 references with
   capacities ranging from 1.4 kW to 4500 kW are evaluated, achieving sink
   outlet temperatures from 45 degrees C to 115 degrees C and COPs from 1.4
   to 11.3. Existing challenges are identified for the compressor
   concerning discharge temperature and lubrication, for the absorber and
   desorber design for operation and liquid-vapor mixing and distribution
   and the choice of solution pump. Recent developments and promising
   solutions are then highlighted and presented in a comprehensive
   overview. Finally, future trends for further studies are discussed. The
   purpose of this study is to serve as a starting point for further
   research by connecting theoretical approaches, possible solutions and
   experimental results as a resource for further developments of
   ammonia-water ACHP systems at high temperature operation.},

Abstract = {The identification of systematic small-and intermediate-scale
   temperature changes (trends) in a time series is of significant
   importance in the analysis of climate data. This is particularly so in
   the analysis of local climate change trends and their potential impact
   on local hydrological cycles. Although many statistical tests have been
   proposed for detecting these trends their effectiveness is often
   affected by the presence of serial correlation in the time series.
   Hence, it is of both interest and necessity to compare the performances
   of these tests by applying them under a representative range of
   conditions. In this study, we use Monte Carlo experiments to compare and
   explore six commonly used tests for detecting trend. For this purpose,
   we use the confidence level and power to assess the ability to detect
   trend in two groups of simulated time series with and without serial
   correlation. The statistical tests are also applied to mean annual
   temperature measured at 13 weather stations located in the Valencia
   region (Eastern Spain).},

Abstract = {Streams within geothermal areas in Iceland that vary in a syndrome of
   temperature-linked variables, including discharge and potential grazing
   pressure (snails vs. chironomid larvae), provided a test of how
   microvegetation structure might change systematically with such drivers.
   We examined if such streams could form a parallel with biome sequences,
   for example with similar change in overall structure and organism traits
   found from tundra to Boreal forest. The warmer streams had an over-story
   of bryophytes with more open patches of epilithic algae and
   Cyanobacteria, and a grazer community of snails and blackfly larvae; the
   vegetation of the colder streams consisted mainly of epilithic algae and
   Cyanobacteria, dominated by grazing chironomid larvae. Diatom species
   comprising the epilithic assemblages were generally smaller in the
   warmer streams compared with the colder streams. Temperature and
   discharge did not significantly influence the diversity of diatoms
   (Shannon Index, Sorensen Index, Evenness, Species richness), although
   more species were observed in the colder streams compared with the
   warmer streams. Trait diversity was greatest in the coldest streams, but
   despite high grazing pressure only one growth form (attachment by a
   mucilage stalk) was predominant in the warmer regimes. Grazers may have
   influenced diatom species traits but did not significantly suppress the
   diatom biomass. Analogy with the sequence from tundra, through taiga to
   boreal forest, over a comparable temperature gradient, showed some
   parallel features but important differences. Microorganism systems may
   thus not always be the useful surrogates for larger systems that some
   ecologists have suggested.},

Abstract = {Long-term browning has resulted in increases in dissolved organic carbon
   and reduced water clarity that have altered the vertical physical
   structure of many lake ecosystems. The primary responses include reduced
   ultraviolet (UV) penetration, warming surface waters, and decreased
   deepwater dissolved oxygen concentrations that interactively alter
   vertical habitat suitability for zooplankton. Over 3 decades, Daphnia
   populations have decreased in abundance and shallowed in their vertical
   distribution in temperate Lake Giles (Pennsylvania, USA). Using 3
   decades of corresponding long-term vertical profile data of UV
   radiation, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen, we modelled both the
   suitable vertical habitat and thermally optimal habitat for Daphnia to
   understand the potential role of habitat availability for their
   population dynamics. The vertical extent of suitable habitat increased
   over time primarily due to strong decreases in UV penetration. In
   contrast, thermally optimal habitat decreased due to strong increases in
   vertical thermal gradients that were especially strong in late summer.
   The vertical distribution of Daphnia became shallower over this time
   period and may be a response to lower UV exposure near the surface, but
   continued warming of surface waters and decreasing deepwater dissolved
   oxygen concentrations are likely to lead to a vertical habitat squeeze.
   The biological implications of long-term browning require more attention
   due to the complex and important implications for population dynamics,
   species interactions, and food web structure in lakes.},

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature frequency
   trends on the projected yield and dry matter distribution of japonica
   rice (Oryza sativa L.) with elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) under future
   climate change scenarios in northwestern China. The Crop Environment
   Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Rice model was forced with the outputs from
   three general circulation models (GCMs) to project the rice growth and
   yield. Future temperature trends had the most significant impact on rice
   growth, and the frequency of higher than optimal temperatures ( similar
   to 24-28 degrees C) for rice growth showed a marked increase in the
   future, which greatly restricted photosynthesis. The frequency of
   extreme temperatures (>35 degrees C) also increased, exerting a strong
   impact on rice fertilization and producing a significantly reduced
   yield. Although the increased temperature suppressed photosynthetic
   production, the elevated CO2 stimulated this production; therefore, the
   net result was determined by the dominant process. The aboveground
   biomass at harvest trended downward when temperature became the major
   factor in photosynthetic production and trended upward when
   CO2-fertilization dominated the process. The trends for the leaf and
   stem dry matter at harvest were affected not only by changes in
   photosynthesis but also by the dry matter distribution to the panicles.
   The trends for the rice panicle dry matter at harvest were closely
   related to the effects of temperature andCO(2) on photosynthetic
   production, and extreme temperatures also remarkably affected these
   trends by reducing the number of fertilized spikelets. The trends of
   rice yield were very similar to those of panicle dry matter because the
   panicle dry matter is mostly composed of grain weight (yield). This
   study provides a better understanding of the japonica rice processes,
   particularly under extreme climate scenarios, which will likely become
   more frequent in the future.},

Abstract = {Tree rings are widely used to reconstruct past climates in regions where
   observational records of climate are short. In this study, we developed
   a 294 years-long (1718-2011 CE) ring-width chronology of the Himalayan
   Silver fir (Abies spectabilis (D.Don, Spach)) from Humla district in
   western Nepal to reconstruct winter minimum temperature for the remote
   region of central Himalaya where instrumental records are limited to
   past three or four decades. Ring-width chronology of the Himalayan
   Silver fir showed strongest and significant positive correlation with
   minimum winter temperature prior to the growing season. Based on this
   relationship, we reconstructed the winter season (previous
   October-current February) minimum temperature for western Nepal covering
   the period of 1780-2008 CE. Our reconstruction showed that winter
   minimum temperature is continuously increasing since the early twentieth
   century with unprecedented rapid warming in the latter half. The cold
   episodes in the reconstruction coincided with the major volcanic
   eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions. The spectral
   analysis using Multi-Taper Method revealed that the winter temperature
   in the north-western Himalaya has short- to medium-term periodicities of
   2-3, 5.8-6.2, 7.9-8.2, 39-46 and 56-73 years, which suggest possible
   teleconnections with ENSO (El-Nino Southern Oscillation) and AMO
   (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation).},

Abstract = {Summer temperature dominates environmental degradation and water
   resource availability on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), affecting glacier
   melting, permafrost degradation, desertification and stream flow, etc.
   Extending summer temperature records back before the instrumental period
   is fundamentally important for climatic and environmental studies over
   long timescales. By pooling 39 tree-ring width records from the TP that
   show significant (P < 0.05) correlations with the summer (June August)
   minimum temperature (MinT) of the nearest grid point, we reconstructed a
   366-year summer MinT record for the southern TP (STP). Reconstructed and
   instrumental data are highly coherent within the 1950-2010 calibration
   interval (R2 = 0.50, P < 0.001). The reconstruction captures major
   temperature anomalies, such as the coldest interval of the 1810s-1820s
   and unprecedented warming since the 1990s. We found that the linear
   trends of the instrumental and reconstructed STP summer MinTs are
   significantly lower than those for the larger Eurasian continent over
   the periods 1950-2010 and 1850-1950, respectively. The lower warming
   rate of STP summer MinT since 1850 could be due to increased evaporative
   cooling, and the absence ofwarming enhancement factors such as
   snow-albedo and energy-absorbing aerosols in summer. The reconstructed
   summer warming rate for the STP appears to be significantly
   overestimated by the ensemble mean of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical simulation.},

Title = {Effect of land cover change and elevation on decadal trend of land
   surface temperature: a linear model with sum contrast analysis},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {149},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a significant factor in surface energy
   balance and global climatology studies. Land cover (LC) and elevation
   are two factors that affect the change of LST, and their effects depend
   on different geography. This study aims to demonstrate an alternative
   approach to examine the change of LST during 20 years (2001 to 2020) on
   Taiwan Island and to investigate the effect of LC change and elevation
   on a decadal trend of LST using a linear model that adjusting for each
   determinate factor. MODIS LST and LC data, as well as GMTED2010
   elevation product, were downloaded available website. The natural cubic
   spline function was used to model annual seasonal patterns in LST.
   Linear regression model was used to estimate decadal change of long-term
   LST time series. Weighted sum contrasts linear regression was used to
   assess the effect of LC transformation and elevation on the decadal LST
   change by comparing adjusting mean of all factors. The adopted analysis
   method was an appropriate approach to assess categorical factors than
   those based on treatment contrasts, requiring specifying a control group
   to compare means and confidence intervals. Results showed that there was
   an increase in LST for most of the island. The average daytime and
   nighttime LST trends were 0.12 and 0.31 degrees C/decade, respectively.
   However, areas in the southern part of the north-south direction
   mountain range show a statistically significant increase in LST in both
   daytime and nighttime. The major landslides caused this noticeable
   change of surface temperature due to the catastrophic damage of typhoon
   Morakot in 2009. The results also revealed that the different pattern of
   LC change has a significant effect on daytime LST, but not on nighttime
   LST trends. The elevation above 600 m had affected both daytime and
   nighttime LSTs.},

Title = {Quantifying the Trends in Land Surface Temperature and Surface Urban
   Heat Island Intensity in Mediterranean Cities in View of Smart
   Urbanization},
Journal = {URBAN SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key parameter for the estimation of
   urban fluxes as well as for the assessment of the presence and strength
   of the surface urban heat island (SUHI). In an urban environment, LST
   depends on the way the city has been planned and developed over time. To
   this end, the estimation of LST needs adequate spatial and temporal data
   at the urban scale, especially with respect to land cover/land use. The
   present study is divided in two parts: at first, satellite data from
   MODIS-Terra 8-day product (MOD11A2) were used for the analysis of an
   eighteen-year time series (2001-2017) of the LST spatial and temporal
   distribution in five major cities of the Mediterranean during the summer
   months. LST trends were retrieved and assessed for their statistical
   significance. Secondly, LST values and trends for each city were
   examined in relation to land cover characteristics and patterns in order
   to define the contribution of urban development and planning on LST;
   this information is important for the drafting of smart urbanization
   policies and measures. Results revealed (a) positive LST trends in the
   urban areas especially during nighttime ranging from +0.412 degrees K in
   Marseille to +0.923 degrees K in Cairo and (b) the SUHI has intensified
   during the last eighteen years especially during daytime in European
   Mediterranean cities, such as Rome (+0.332 degrees K) and Barcelona
   (+0.307 degrees K).},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {The first four statistical moments and their trends are calculated for
   the average daily surface air temperature (SAT) from 1950 to 2010 using
   the Global Historical Climatology Network Daily station data for each
   season relative to the 1961-90 climatology over the Northern Hemisphere.
   Temporal variation of daily SAT probability distributions are
   represented as generalized linear regression coefficients on the mean,
   standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis calculated for each 10-yr
   moving time window from 1950-59 to 2001-10. The climatology and trends
   of these statistical moments suggest that daily SAT probability
   distributions are non-Gaussian and are changing in time. The climatology
   of the first four statistical moments has distinct spatial patterns with
   large coherent structure for mean and standard deviation and relatively
   smaller and more regionalized patterns for skewness and kurtosis. The
   linear temporal trends from 1950 to 2010 of the first four moments also
   have coherent spatial patterns. The linear temporal trends in the
   characterizing statistical moments are statistically significant at most
   locations and have differing spatial patterns for different moments. The
   regionalized variations specific to higher moments may be related to the
   climate dynamics that contribute to extremes. The nonzero skewness and
   kurtosis makes this detailed documentation on the higher statistical
   moments useful for quantifying climate changes and assessing climate
   model uncertainties.},

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the most challenging environmental issues faced
   by the present day world community. Its impacts are reflected in
   different components of the socioeconomic and biophysical systems.
   Temperature is a fundamental climatic variable that is studied
   thoroughly across globe for the similar purpose of capturing the dynamic
   nature of the variable and relating it with the human interventions over
   time. The main objective of the present study is to analyse the
   long-term trends in temperature that have occurred in the territory of
   Kazakhstan on annual, seasonal and monthly time scales. The study used
   the non-parametric statistical methods such as M-K statistical test,
   Sen's slope estimator, and Pettit's test to analyse the time series data
   and portray it through various GIS techniques. The results revealed that
   Kazakhstan showed a significant increasing trend in the mean annual
   temperature from 1970 to 2017. The Sen's slope estimator reflected that
   the mean temperature increased at an annual rate of 0.034 degrees C for
   the selected time period with a probable change point detected in the
   year 1996. On the seasonal scale, all the four seasons showed increasing
   trends for their respective average temperatures. Among the four
   seasons, highest increase in the temperature was reported by spring
   season which was subsequently followed by winter and autumn seasons. The
   least increase was reflected by summer season for which the variable
   increased at 0.20 degrees C/decade. The months of March and August were
   significant contributors to the warming that happened in Kazakhstan
   during the studied time period of 48 years.},

Abstract = {This study examines the spatiotemporal variability of mean monthly
   temperature in the Moulouya watershed of northeastern Morocco,
   highlighting associated trends. To this end, statistical methods widely
   recommended by climate researchers were adopted. We used monthly mean
   temperature data for the period 1980-2020 from 9 measuring stations
   belonging to the Moulouya Watershed Agency (ABHM). These stations were
   rigorously selected, taking into account their reliability, the length
   of their records, and their geographical position in the basin. In
   addition, a quality test and homogenization of the temperature series
   were carried out using the Climatol tool. The results obtained show a
   significant upward trend in mean monthly temperature, mainly pronounced
   during the summer months, in the Moulouya watershed. In fact, Z values
   generally exceeded the 0.05 significance level at all stations during
   April, May, June, July, August, and October. According to the results of
   Sen's slope test, mean monthly temperatures show an annual increase
   ranging from 0 to 0.13 degrees C. The maximum magnitude of warming is
   recorded in July, specifically at Oujda Station. On an overall watershed
   scale, May, August, and July show a rapid warming trend, with average
   rates of 0.093, 0.086, and 0.08 degrees C per year, respectively. By
   contrast, the series for the other months show no significant trend.
   Significant trend change points were also identified at watershed and
   station scales, mainly around 2000, primarily for accelerated warming of
   the summer months.},

Abstract = {The results of assessing long-term changes in water temperature in the
   northern part of the Atlantic Ocean (0 degrees-70 degrees N, 8
   degrees-80 degrees W) according to the data of ocean reanalyses and
   objective analyzes for the periods of 1961-2011 and 1980-2011 are
   presented. The obtained estimates are based on the use of a
   nonparametric method of regression analysis (quantile regression) for
   the monthly mean ocean temperature for a quantile value of 0.5. In
   1961-2011 the warming was mainly recorded in the upper 400-m layer in
   the region from the equator to 70 degrees N. Over this 51-year period,
   the increase in the median monthly ocean temperature was similar to 0.5
   degrees C on average in the analyzed water area, while in the Gulf
   Stream-North Atlantic Current system, it was similar to 1 degrees C.
   During the period of 1980-2011, the warming in the northern part of the
   Atlantic Ocean occurred mainly in the upper 1-km layer at high latitudes
   (50 degrees-65 degrees N). Over this 32-year period, the median monthly
   mean ocean temperature increased in the subpolar gyre in the upper 400-m
   layer by similar to 1 degrees C.},

Abstract = {Background The impacts of heatwaves are a rapidly growing area of study;
   however, much of the existing research focusses on national data
   analysis. This article aims to add a local perspective using data from
   only one county, East Sussex, and comparing these with the pre-existing
   national data.Methods Population data were obtained from publicly
   available sources such as the Office of National Statistics, in addition
   to anonymized data from patients. Statistical analysis calculated excess
   mortality and emergency hospital admissions associated with both winter
   and heatwaves. Further analyses into factors associated with worse
   health outcomes in pre-existing data, such as the extremes of age (under
   1 s and over 75 s), dementia and respiratory conditions, were conducted
   and their effect on excess mortality and emergency admissions was
   compared with national data.Results Excess winter mortality within East
   Sussex averaged 22.5\%. Excess heatwave mortality averaged 17\%,
   measuring higher than national data. The relative significance of these
   data is expected to increase over the next 30 years in line with the UK
   Health Security Agency projection of heat-related mortality tripling by
   2050 in the context of global warming and increasing
   temperatures.Conclusions Although the number of residents dying or
   requiring emergency admission due to cold weather is larger than that of
   heatwaves, trends show a worsening impact of heatwaves. The results of
   this report are significant findings which show more action is required
   to mitigate the effects of extreme heat.},

Title = {Inter-Annual Variability and Trends of Sea Level and Sea Surface
   Temperature in the Mediterranean Sea over the Last 25 Years},
Journal = {PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS},

Volume = {176},

Abstract = {Sea level and sea surface temperature inter-annual variability and
   trends in the Mediterranean Sea were investigated during the period
   1993-2017. These were carried out using gridded absolute dynamic
   topography from satellite altimetry, tide gauge (TG) time series from 25
   stations and gridded sea surface temperature (SST) from advanced
   very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data. The coastal TG data were
   used to verify the satellite derived sea level. Moreover, the
   contributions of atmospheric pressure and North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) to sea level changes were also examined. The results revealed that
   the Mediterranean Sea exhibits inter-annual spatiotemporal coherent
   variability in both sea level and SST. The spatial variability in sea
   level is more significant over the Adriatic and Aegean Seas, most of the
   Levantine basin, and along the Tunisian shelf. Marked spatial
   variability in SST occurs over the central part of the Mediterranean Sea
   with maximum amplitude in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The highest temporal
   variability of sea level and SST was found in 2010 and 2003,
   respectively. The inter-annual variability of sea level and SST accounts
   for about 32\% and 3\% of the total variance of sea level and SST,
   respectively. An analysis of sea level anomaly reveled large negative
   values during the extended winter of 2011-2012, which may be attributed
   to the strong positive phase of NAO index. Satellite altimetry indicated
   a significant positive sea level trend of 2.7 +/- 0.41 mm/year together
   with a significant warming of 0.036 +/- 0.003 degrees C/year over the
   whole Mediterranean Sea for the period 1993-2017.},

Title = {Temperature sensitivity as an explanation of the latitudinal pattern of
   green-up date trend in Northern Hemisphere vegetation during 1982-2008},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {35},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3707-3712},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The vegetation green-up date (GUD) is widely expected to advance to an
   earlier date in the year in response to increasing spring temperature.
   However, although it is well known that climatic warming has been more
   intensive at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes in the Northern
   Hemisphere, it is not known whether this greater climatic warming at
   higher latitudes has led to a greater advance of vegetation GUD during
   the past few decades. We have first determined GUD from the
   satellite-derived greenness vegetation index for all the vegetated land
   between 30 and 75 degrees N from 1982 to 2008, and then investigated the
   latitudinal pattern of the inter-annual trend of GUD and its relation to
   pre-season temperature. The results show a generally greater GUD advance
   in lower latitudes, in spite of the faster increase in pre-season
   temperature in higher latitudes. We find that 88\% of the latitudinal
   variability in the GUD trend can be explained by the sensitivity of the
   GUD response to pre-season temperature. The GUD change has also resulted
   in a northward shift of GUD isolines by 1 degrees-4 degrees between 50
   and 65 degrees N during the period. These findings highlight the
   sensitivity of vegetation response to temperature in shaping the spatial
   pattern of spring phenological change and suggest that temperate
   ecosystems may experience greater phenological change if the current
   latitudinal pattern of climatic warming continues.},

   Lagoon: a study aligned with Saudi Arabia's vision 2030},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUL 23},
Abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are vital to arid environments like Saudi Arabia,
   offering crucial ecological services and enhancing biodiversity. This
   study investigates the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of
   mangrove coverage in the Al Wajh lagoon area, crucial for crafting
   effective conservation and management strategies. Employing
   high-resolution Landsat and Sentinel imagery, the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were analysed
   across 35 mangrove clusters. By 2023, mangroves covered approximately
   24.5 km2. Kendall Tau-b Correlation Coefficients confirmed a significant
   positive trend. The study further explored the relationship between NDVI
   and surface temperature, revealing an inverse correlation with slope
   values ranging from -4.03 to -44.1, suggesting that increased mangrove
   coverage significantly contributes to local cooling, thereby
   underscoring the climate regulation benefits of mangrove conservation.
   This positive change in NDVI post-2020 is directly attributable to the
   conservation efforts embedded within the Red Sea Project, Vision 2030,
   development phases, demonstrating the critical role of designated
   conservation zones in mitigating the environmental impacts of
   large-scale development projects. The findings underscore the need for
   targeted policies to protect and expand mangrove habitats as part of
   broader environmental sustainability goals in the region.},

Abstract = {The risk of high-temperature-related diseases is increasing owing to
   global warming. This study aimed to assess the trend of disease burden
   caused by high temperatures in Mainland China from 1990 to 2019 and to
   predict the trend of disease burden over the next 10 years. The latest
   data were downloaded from the Global Burden of Disease Database (GBD)
   for analysis, and the disease burden related to high temperature was
   described by mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and
   stratified by etiology, sex, and age. Statistical analyses were
   performed using the R software. In 2019, there were 13,907 deaths
   attributed to high temperatures in Mainland China, and this was 29.55\%
   higher than the 10,735 deaths in 1990. Overall, the age-standardized
   mortality and DALYs attributed to high temperatures showed a downward
   trend from 1990 to 2019. We observed an etiological shift in
   high-temperature-related diseases. The age-standardized DALYs
   contribution attributed to high temperatures in 1990 was mainly from
   communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNND)
   (21.81/100,000), followed by injury (18.30/100,000) and non-communicable
   diseases (10.40/100,000). In 2019, the largest contribution shifted to
   non-communicable diseases (10.07/100,000), followed by injuries
   (5.21/100,000), and CMNND (2.30/100,000). The disease burden attributed
   to high temperatures was higher in males than in females and increased
   with age. In 2030, the mortality rate and DALYs due to high temperatures
   are predicted to decrease further, and the largest contribution will
   come from chronic non-communicable diseases, the occurrence of which
   will remain at a high level over the next 10 years. The burden of
   disease due to high temperatures in Mainland China is still heavy,
   mainly due to population aging and an increase in non-communicable
   diseases.},

Abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between changes in land cover and the
   time-series trend of temperature using 40 years' worth of data
   (1980-2019) from 38 weather stations in South Korea to establish
   mitigation strategies for the rising temperature and heat island effect
   in urban areas. Changes in temperature were estimated by analyzing the
   time-series trend slope using daily mean temperature data. Stations with
   a high trend slope showed a mean temperature rise of 2 degrees C over
   the study period, and those with a low trend slope had a mean
   temperature rise of 0.5 degrees C. In land cover change, each study site
   was classified into three categories: areas with heavy urbanization,
   areas with few land-cover changes, and decreased rural and forest areas.
   A correlation analysis between the landcover change and temperature
   trend slope revealed a positive correlation between urban areas and the
   trend slope and a negative correlation between forest areas and the
   trend slope. The expansion of urban areas resulting from the development
   of forest areas was identified as the cause of the long-term increase in
   the urban temperature. These results will serve as useful data in the
   urban and environmental planning phase for mitigating urban heat island
   effects.},

Title = {Investigation of the trends of electricity demands in Jordan and its
   susceptibility to the ambient air temperature towards sustainable
   electricity generation},
Journal = {ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Background Efficient production and reliable availability of electricity
   requires comprehensive understanding of load demand trends to plan and
   match production with consumption. Although electricity demand depends
   on a combination of cultural and economic conditions, weather conditions
   remain as the major driver. With increased capabilities of accurate
   predictions of weather, the importance of investigating and quantifying
   its impact on electricity demand becomes obvious. The electrical system
   in Jordan has been facing several challenges including the failure to
   respond to increased demands induced by extreme temperatures. This paper
   covers a clear gap in literature through presenting a detailed
   investigation of the electricity consumption trends and in identifying
   the susceptibility of these trends to weather. Methods This study relies
   on the statistical processing and analysis, through modeling of hourly
   electricity demands in Jordan in the period of 10 years between 2007 and
   2016. Actual weather data was used employing the degree-day approach.
   The monthly, daily, and hourly seasonal variation indices were
   determined. Optimally formulated piecewise functions were used to track
   the thermal comfort zone and rate of increase in electricity demand for
   temperatures beyond it for each year. Moreover, the elasticity of
   polynomial functions was adopted to identify saturation points to
   thermally map the electricity consumption. Results The developed models
   successfully described the relationship between the daily electricity
   demand and the mean daily ambient temperature. The average comfort zone
   width was 4 degrees C and the average mean base temperature was 17.9
   degrees C. The sensitivity of electricity demand to both high and low
   temperatures has increased on average, with 11\% and 16.4\% to hot and
   cold weather, respectively. Finally, the electricity demand in cooling
   was found to saturate at 32.9 degrees C, whereas it saturates for
   heating at 4.7 degrees C. Conclusions The electricity demand in Jordan
   observes seasonal trends in a consistent and predictable manner. An
   optimally formulated piecewise function successfully tracked the thermal
   comfort zone and the rate of increase in electricity demand for
   temperatures beyond it for each year of the study period. Finally,
   saturation heating and cooling temperatures were acquired from the
   elasticity of the daily electricity demands modeled against daily HDD
   and CDD.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {190},
Pages = {87-100},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A large number of short-term leaching experiments has been performed to
   determine fission product and actinide release from used CANDU (CANada
   Deuterium Uranium) fuels and to establish which factors affect release.
   Results are reported after 30 +/- 10 d leaching at 100-150-degrees-C
   under oxidizing (air) or reducing (Ar-3\% H-2 or Ar) conditions, in
   various synthetic groundwaters. Cesium-137 release (0.007-6\%) was
   positively correlated with increases in fuel power, leachant temperature
   and ionic strength. Strontium-90 release (0.0003-0.3\%) generally
   increased with ionic strength, higher temperature and redox conditions.
   Actinide and Tc concentrations were compared to ranges calculated with a
   thermodynamic equilibrium model, that accounts for the uncertain
   geochemical parameters of a nuclear waste vault by calculating
   concentration ranges based on 40000 hypothetical cases. Experimental U
   concentrations (10(-8.5) to 10(-3) mol/kg) were higher than the model
   range, probably because of higher redox potentials in the experiments.
   Measured Pu concentrations (10(-12.5) to 10(-7) mol/kg) were at the low
   end of the calculated range. Americium and Cm concentrations (10(-12.5)
   to 10(-7) and 10(-15) to 10(-9) mol/kg, respectively) were highest under
   oxidizing conditions and higher temperatures. Technetium-99
   concentrations (10(-5.5) to 10(-10. 5) mol/kg) covered a much narrower
   range than calculated by the model.},

Title = {Increasing persistent haze in Beijing: potential impacts of weakening
   East Asian winter monsoons associated with northwestern Pacific sea
   surface temperature trends},

Abstract = {Over the past decades, Beijing, the capital city of China, has
   encountered increasingly frequent persistent haze events (PHE). While
   the increased pollutant emissions are considered as the most important
   reason, changes in regional atmospheric circulations associated with
   large-scale climate warming also play a role. In this study, we find a
   significant positive trend of PHE in Beijing for the winters from 1980
   to 2016 based on updated daily observations. This trend is closely
   related to an increasing frequency of extreme anomalous southerly
   episodes in North China, a weakened East Asian trough in the
   mid-troposphere and a northward shift of the East Asian jet stream in
   the upper troposphere. These conditions together depict a weakened East
   Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) system, which is then found to be associated
   with an anomalous warm, high-pressure system in the middle-lower
   troposphere over the northwestern Pacific. A practical EAWM index is
   defined as the seasonal meridional wind anomaly at 850 hPa in winter
   over North China. Over the period 1900-2016, this EAWM index is
   positively correlated with the sea surface temperature anomalies over
   the northwestern Pacific, which indicates a wavy positive trend, with an
   enhanced positive phase since the mid-1980s. Our results suggest an
   observation-based mechanism linking the increase in PHE in Beijing with
   large-scale climatic warming through changes in the typical regional
   atmospheric circulation.},

Abstract = {In this research, the instability of n-type low-temperature
   polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film transistors (LTPS TFTs) is
   investigated under DC bias stress and a unique phenomenon is observed.
   At a large gate stressing voltage and simultaneous low to moderate drain
   biasing voltages operating in a linear region, a turn-around phenomenon
   is observed in the on-current (I(on)) degradation trend of the TFT
   characteristics, resulting from the increase in maximum transconductance
   (G(m,max)). However, under a larger drain stressing voltage, the
   turn-around phenomenon of the I(on) degradation trend is observed to
   disappear owing to the extensive increases in threshold voltage (V(th))
   and trap state density (N(trap)) in a channel, which cause the TFTs to
   deteriorate monotonically. (C) 2010 The Japan Society of Applied Physics},

Title = {Correlation Between the Arabian Sea Surface Temperature and the Onset
   Period of South Asian Summer Monsoon with Trend Analysis on the
   Intensity},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The long-term trend of the Arabian Sea surface temperature (ASST) during
   the formation of the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) is discussed in
   this manuscript. From April to June, ASST changed from a meridional
   gradual distribution to a spatially uniform distribution and then to a
   zonal gradual distribution. The South Asian summer monsoon intensity
   (SASMI) and South Asian summer monsoon direction (SASMD) indicate that
   the variation of the ASST is highly related to the formation of the SASM
   during the summer monsoon period and can contribute to the spread of the
   SASM from the Southwest Arabian Sea throughout all of South Asia.
   Results of the correlation between the ASST and SASMI for the same month
   and its adjacent months were the same, and the areas of the positive
   correlation between the ASST and SASMI significantly increased from
   May-June as compared to April-May. The maximum correlation coefficient
   was 0.86. The results of the ASST and SASMD for the same month and its
   adjacent months were substantially different. However, the ASST and
   SASMD for May and April also showed a high positive correlation with a
   maximum correlation coefficient of 0.61 in the southwestern Arabian Sea.
   Existence of the ASST had a spatially consistent and significant upward
   trend with a mean increase of 0.6 degrees C during the summer monsoon
   period from 1980 to 2020 (between April and September), whereas the
   SASMI had a strengthening trend along the western and southwestern
   regions of the Arabian Sea and the southeastern region of the Arabian
   Peninsula. Meanwhile, the rest of the study regions showed a declining
   trend. Overall, the entire study region showed a slight downward trend,
   and the average value decreased by 0.02ms(-1).},

Abstract = {The recent annually averaged warming of the Antarctic Peninsula, and of
   West Antarctica, stands in stark contrast to very small trends over East
   Antarctica. This asymmetry arises primarily from a highly significant
   warming of West Antarctica in austral spring and a cooling of East
   Antarctica in austral autumn. Here we examine whether this East-West
   asymmetry is a response to anthropogenic climate forcings or a
   manifestation of natural climate variability. We compare the observed
   Antarctic surface air temperature trends over two distinct time periods
   (1960-2005 and 1979-2005), and with those simulated by 40 models
   participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   (CMIP5). We find that the observed East-West asymmetry differs
   substantially between the two periods and, furthermore, that it is
   completely absent from the forced response seen in the CMIP5 multi-model
   mean, from which all natural variability is eliminated by the averaging.
   We also examine the relationship between the Southern Annular mode (SAM)
   and Antarctic temperature trends, in both models and reanalyses, and
   again conclude that there is little evidence of anthropogenic
   SAM-induced driving of the recent temperature trends. These results
   offer new, compelling evidence pointing to natural climate variability
   as a key contributor to the recent warming of West Antarctica and of the
   Peninsula.},

Abstract = {Using the daily maximum air temperature and mean humidity observations
   at 394 surface weather stations across China, the changes in the annual
   number of days of high temperature weather (HTW), high humidity weather
   (HHW), and sultry weather (STW) in China over the period 1961-2004 are
   studied. The results indicate that there were considerable spatial
   differences and temporal variability of HTW, HHW, and STW across China.
   Under a climatic mean condition, a notable feature is that southeastern
   China is the region of collocation of high values of the annual number
   of days of HTW, HHW, and STW, as well as the region of the most
   significant variabilities of these parameters. About 55\% of the
   stations in China have increasing trends of the annual number of days of
   HTW. Most stations in China show decreasing trends of the annual number
   of days of HHW and are mainly located either in the area south of 30
   degrees N or in northern and northeastern China. The stations with
   increasing trends of the annual number of days of STW are mainly located
   in northern China, while the stations that have decreasing trends are
   primarily located in southern China. The analysis results suggest that
   the variability of the annual number of days of STW corresponds mainly
   to HTW, and less to HHW. The change in the East Asian monsoon may be
   responsible for the changes of these statistics in extreme weather in
   China.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal analysis of seasonal trends in land surface temperature
   within the distribution range of <i>Moringa peregrina</i> (Forssk.) in
   Southern and Southeastern Iran},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},

Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {Temperature fluctuations and related factors are among the main causes
   of climate change. Understanding the temporal and spatial variations in
   temperature can shed light on how species respond to climate change.
   Plants generally persist in suitable microclimates in response to
   environmental change; however, examining long-term temperature
   variations within a species' range can be challenging using field
   observations. Thermal remote sensing, on the other hand, provides
   multi-scale time-series data with good coverage and regularity to
   overcome the challenges associated with field observations in
   environmental monitoring. Although changes in land surface temperature
   (LST) affect climate, hydrological processes, land-atmosphere
   interactions, and ecological activities, this metric has not received
   much research attention. This study aimed to analyze changes in habitat
   suitability and microclimatic conditions for Moringa peregrina. Seasonal
   changes in LST within the distribution range of the species were also
   investigated. To this aim, mean seasonal LST was computed in Google
   Earth Engine using the daily MODIS/006/MYD13A2 product from 2003 to
   2023. Subsequently, a binary habitat suitability map was created based
   on the true skill statistic (TSS). The Mann-Kendall test was used to
   analyze seasonal LST trends. Major trends in LST were quantified based
   on the z-score, and compatibility with habitat suitability was evaluated
   via GAP analysis and the Kappa index. Seasonal temperature trends were
   evaluated by comparing each season with the following season using
   binary comparison. Landforms at presence points were regarded as
   microclimates and the sensitivity of microclimates to LST was evaluated
   using two methods: Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to
   quantify seasonal LST heterogeneity and the random forest (RF) approach
   was used to evaluate the effect of environmental parameters on habitat
   suitability within microclimates. The Kappa index revealed a weak
   overlapping between suitable / unsuitable habitat and the surfaces
   affected by the trend of changes. Moreover, the suitable habitat of
   Moringa peregrina in spring, autumn and winter is spatially overlapped
   by areas that have shown an increasing LST trend, and the presence
   points have not experienced an increasing temperature trend only in the
   summer. The findings show that the analysis of seasonal trends in LST
   provides insights into the effect of LST on habitat suitability and the
   condition of vegetation. The current study clearly shows that seasonal
   changes have had a significant impact on the distribution and habitat
   suitability of M. peregrina, particularly during summer and winter.
   Improved habitat suitability and range expansion were observed
   throughout the year. The study also highlights the role of landforms in
   regulating temperature. Landforms such as local ridges with minimal
   temperature fluctuations and regions near the Oman Sea were identified
   as potential future habitats due to favorable humidity conditions.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Anomalies in monthly mean surface air temperature from the 45-Year
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis
   (ERA-40) and the first National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR)
   reanalysis are compared with corresponding values from the Climatic
   Research Unit (CRU) CRUTEM2v data set derived directly from monthly
   station data. There is mostly very similar short-term variability,
   especially between ERA-40 and CRUTEM2v. Linear trends are significantly
   lower for the two reanalyses when computed over the full period studied,
   1958 - 2001, but ERA-40 trends are within 10\% of CRUTEM2v values for
   the Northern Hemisphere when computed from 1979 onward. Gaps in the
   availability of synoptic surface data contribute to relatively poor
   performance of ERA-40 prior to 1967. A few highly suspect values in each
   of the data sets have also been identified. ERA-40' s use of
   screen-level observations contributes to the agreement between the
   ERA-40 and CRUTEM2v analyses, but the quality of the overall observing
   system and general character of the ERA-40 data assimilation system are
   also contributing factors. Temperatures from ERA-40 vary coherently
   throughout the boundary layer from the late 1970s onward, in general,
   and earlier for some regions. There is a cold bias in early years at 500
   hPa over the data-sparse southern extratropics and at the surface over
   Antarctica. One indicator of this comes from comparing the ERA-40
   analyses with results from a simulation of the atmosphere for the ERA-40
   period produced using the same model and same distributions of sea
   surface temperature and sea ice as used in the ERA-40 data assimilation.
   The simulation itself reproduces quite well the warming trend over land
   seen in CRUTEM2v and captures some of the low-frequency variability.},

Abstract = {Water temperature and the alternation of stratification and mixing count
   amongst key drivers of lake ecology. Reliable long time-series of water
   temperature are rare. Here, we investigated how a numerical model can
   fill the gaps in heterogeneous time-series and make it possible to
   identify a significant trend in the lake thermal regime. We computed the
   mean water temperature and the Schmidt stability, an indicator of the
   stratification strength, in a deep and well-stratified lake (Lake
   Bourget, France), between 1976 and 2008. We first used temperature
   measurements and then a one-dimensional vertical model, which we
   describe here. The model performs as well as the best existing models.
   During the 1976-2008 periods, whereas no statistically significant trend
   came out of the measurements, we found in the simulation results an
   increase of 0.12 A degrees C per decade in the water temperature and of
   5.9 days per decade in the stratification duration. This shows that the
   temperature history of a lake can be reconstructed and a reliable
   long-term trend computed when weather data and a calibrated temperature
   model are available. Our results also suggest that different local
   climatic influences cause a slower warming in this lake of the
   south-western Alps than in other sub-alpine lakes.},

Abstract = {Changes in the ice phenology, seasonal temperature and extreme events
   are consistent evidence of climate change effect on lakes. In this
   study, we analyzed multiannual variability, determined long-term trends
   and detected changes in the frequency of extreme events in the surface
   water temperature (LSWT) of Lake Peipsi (Estonia/Russia) for nearly
   seven decades (1950-2018) and aimed to trace how the LSWT responded to
   the climate change. Dynamic water temperature parameters were calculated
   using the smoothed water temperature curve fitted to daily water
   temperatures. Our results showed that, although the average LSWT did not
   increase significantly on an annual basis since 1950 it rose rapidly in
   the winter season during the last decade (similar to +0.5 degrees C).
   Ice formation exhibited a marked (similar to 15 days) delay since 2007
   resulting in a longer open water period. Extreme LSWT events did not
   occur more frequently. We noticed however significant fluctuating in
   winter LSWT in time series, starting from 2007 and also causing an
   increase in stochasticity. The consequences of the on-going winter
   warming and changes of ice cover phenology are expected to be crucial
   for Lake Peipsi ecosystem functioning and impact on lake biota,
   especially temperature-sensitive native fishes.},

Abstract = {Limited time period running trends are created from various microwave
   sounding unit (MSU) difference time series between the University of
   Alabama in Huntsville and Remote Sensing System (RSS) group's lower
   troposphere ( LT) and mid troposphere to lower stratosphere channels.
   This is accomplished in an effort to determine the causes of the
   greatest discrepancies between the two data sets. Results indicate the
   greatest discrepancies were over time periods where NOAA 11 through NOAA
   15 adjustments were applied to the raw LT data over land. Discrepancies
   in the LT channel are shown to be dominated by differences in diurnal
   correction methods due to orbital drift; however, discrepancies from
   target parameter differences are also present. Comparison of MSU data
   with the reduced Radiosonde Atmospheric Temperature Products for
   Assessing Climate radiosonde data set indicates that RSS's method ( use
   of climate model) of determining diurnal effects is likely
   overestimating the correction in the LT channel. Diurnal correction
   signatures still exist in the RSS LT time series and are likely
   affecting the long-term trend with a warm bias. Our findings enhance the
   importance of understanding temporal changes in the atmospheric
   temperature trend profile and their implications on current climate
   studies.},

Title = {Long-Term Trend of Equatorial Atlantic Zonal Sea Surface Temperature
   Gradient Linked to the Tropical Pacific Cold Tongue Mode Under Global
   Warming},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The equatorial Atlantic zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient,
   which has significant climatic and biogeochemical effects, is closely
   associated with the equatorial Pacific zonal SST gradient through Walker
   circulation on seasonal and interannual time scales. However,
   discrepancies in current SST data sets mean that its long-term trend is
   not well understood. Here, using multiple data sets, we find a robust
   weakening long-term trend (i.e., greater warming in the east than west)
   in the equatorial Atlantic zonal SST gradient over the period 1900-2010
   in all data sets. We also find that this weakening trend is closely
   linked to the tropical Pacific cold tongue mode (CTM), which corresponds
   to a strong increasing long-term trend of zonal SST gradient along the
   equatorial Pacific (i.e., warming in the west and cooling in the east).
   Specifically, the long-term cooling SST anomalies associated with the
   CTM modify the Walker circulation, and leads to weaker trade winds over
   the western equatorial Atlantic. These in turn deepen the thermocline in
   the eastern equatorial Atlantic, and cause the weakening long-term trend
   of SST gradient along the equatorial Atlantic. The long-term trend of
   the CTM is induced by ocean dynamical feedback in response to global
   warming, suggesting that global warming could affect the equatorial
   Atlantic zonal SST gradient via the CTM. Our results provide a novel
   explanation of the linkages between the long-term trend of equatorial
   Atlantic zonal SST gradient and the CTM under global warming, which
   carries important implications for the relationship between global
   warming and the equatorial Atlantic zonal SST gradient.
   Plain Language Summary The tropical Atlantic plays an important role in
   global climate change, with socioeconomic impacts that are felt
   worldwide. In the equatorial Atlantic, we find a robust weakening
   long-term trend (i.e., greater warming in the east than west) in the
   zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient over the period 1900-2010
   in five data sets (HadISST1, ERSST5, COBE2, Kaplan2, and their ensemble
   mean). Interestingly, this weakening trend is closely linked to the
   tropical Pacific cold tongue mode (CTM), which represents an
   out-of-phase relationship of SST variability between the Pacific cold
   tongue region and elsewhere in the tropical Pacific. In particular, the
   CTM shows a strong increasing long-term trend that is induced by the
   response of ocean dynamical feedback to global warming. In addition to
   the impacts of anthropogenic aerosols on the equatorial Atlantic, our
   study provides a linkage between the weakening long-term trend of the
   equatorial Atlantic zonal SST gradient and global warming. Future
   changes in global warming may impact the Atlantic SST and have
   socioeconomic consequences for the Atlantic and surrounding continents.},

Abstract = {Studying the long-term temperature variations and trends helps to
   understand the role of human activities in climate change. We present
   the temperature trends (calculated by the linear regression method) in
   the Northern hemisphere in all seasons for the period of 1980-2016 for
   the ERA-Interim and MERRA-2.0 reanalyses. The temperature trends are
   analyzed for the six standard post-processed pressure levels (850, 500,
   and 250hPa for the troposphere and 70, 10, and 2hPa for the
   stratosphere). In addition, we calculate the non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test to detect the statistically significant temperature trends in
   different pressure levels and seasons. It is found that both reanalyses
   have a negative temperature trend (cooling) in the stratosphere, and the
   magnitude of the cooling rates increases with increasing height. While
   the largest cooling trend (by considering all pressure levels and
   seasons) occurs in the autumn for the MERRA-2.0 (-0.167K/year), the
   largest cooling trend is in winter for the ERA-Interim (-0.118K/year).
   Furthermore, the results of the MANN-Kendall test reveal considerable
   differences in terms of statistically significant temperature changes
   between two reanalyses at 10hPa where the cooling trends are
   statistically significant at 99\% level in all seasons in MERRA-2.0
   reanalysis while the temperature changes are only significant at 99\%
   level in autumn in ERA-Interim. In general, the magnitude of the cooling
   trends in the middle and upper stratosphere is higher for the MERRA-2.0
   than ERA-Interim. Positive temperature trends (warming) are found for
   the bulk of troposphere, though the magnitude of the temperature changes
   over the study period is higher in the lower troposphere (at 850hPa at
   99\% confidence level) for both reanalyses. The largest warming rates
   are found during autumn season where the magnitude of the temperature
   changes are +0.031 (K/year) and +0.033 (K/year) for the MERRA-2.0 and
   ERA-Interim, respectively. Our results suggest a high level of
   uncertainty in the temperature trends in the middle and upper
   stratosphere and a reasonable agreement between ERA-Interim and
   MERRA-2.0 warming trend in the troposphere. We also briefly discuss the
   role of different sources of uncertainty of the temperature trends in
   the middle and upper stratosphere.},

   It is expected that the risk is increase with global warming. This study
   aimed to investigate the changes of Wet Bulb Globe Temperature ( WBGT)
   index in the past and to predict their trend of future changes in
   Tehran, capital of Iran.
   Methods: The meteorological data recorded in Tehran, Iran during the
   statistical period between 1961 and 2009 were obtained from the Iran
   Meteorological Organization and based on them, WBGT index was calculated
   and processed using Man-Kendall correlation test.
   Results: The results of Man-Kendall correlation test showed that the
   trend of changes of annual mean WBGT during the statistical period under
   study ( 1961-2009) has been significantly increasing. In addition, the
   result of proposed predictive model estimated that an increase of about
   1.55 degree in WBGT index will be seen over 40 years from 2009 to 2050
   in Tehran.
   Conclusion: Climate change in Tehran has had an effect on person's
   exposure to heat stresses consistent with global warming.},

Abstract = {Amplitudes, rates, periodicities, causes and future trends of
   temperature variations based on tree rings for the past 2485 years on
   the central-eastern Tibetan Plateau were analyzed. The results showed
   that extreme climatic events on the Plateau, such as the Medieval Warm
   Period, Little Ice Age and 20th Century Warming appeared synchronously
   with those in other places worldwide. The largest amplitude and rate of
   temperature change occurred during the Eastern Jin Event (343-425 AD),
   and not in the late 20th century. There were significant cycles of 1324
   a, 800 a, 199 a, 110 a and 2-3 a in the 2485-year temperature series.
   The 1324 a, 800 a, 199 a and 110 a cycles are associated with solar
   activity, which greatly affects the Earth surface temperature. The
   long-term trends (>1000 a) of temperature were controlled by the
   millennium-scale cycle, and amplitudes were dominated by multi-century
   cycles. Moreover, cold intervals corresponded to sunspot minimums. The
   prediction indicated that the temperature will decrease in the future
   until to 2068 AD and then increase again.},

Title = {Spatial patterns of multi-centennial surface air temperature trends in
   Antarctica over 1-1000 CE: Insights from ice core records and modeling},
Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {271},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The spatial pattern of Antarctic surface air temperature variability on
   multi-decadal to multi-centennial time scales is poorly known because of
   the short instrumental records, the relatively small number of
   high-resolution paleoclimate observations, and biases in climate models.
   Here, changes in surface air temperature over Antarctica are
   reconstructed over the past two millennia using data assimilation
   constrained by different ice core water isotope records in order to
   identify robust signals. The comparison between previous statistically
   based temperature reconstructions and simulations covering the full
   Common Era driven by natural and anthropogenic forcings shows major
   discrepancies occurring in the period 1-1000 CE over East Antarctica,
   with the reconstructions displaying a warming over 1-500 CE that is not
   reproduced by the simulations. This suggests that the trends in the
   first millennium deduced from the statistically based reconstructions
   are unlikely to be entirely forced by external forcings. Our
   reconstructions show the high sensitivity of the 500-year temperature
   trend in Antarctica and its spatial distribution to selection of the
   records for the reconstructions, especially during 1-500 CE. A robust
   cooling over Antarctica during 501-1000 CE has been obtained in three
   data assimilation-based reconstructions with a larger magnitude in the
   WAIS than elsewhere over Antarctica, in agreement with previous
   estimates with the larger changes than simulated in climate models. The
   reconstructions for atmospheric circulation indicate that the pattern of
   temperature changes over 501-1000 CE is related to the positive trend of
   Southern Annular Mode and a deepening of Amundsen Sea Low. This confirms
   the role of internal variability in the temperature trends on
   multi-centennial scales. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Temperature trends in the tropical upper troposphere and lower

Year = {2013},
Volume = {118},

Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Satellite observations and chemistry-climate model experiments are used
   to understand the zonal structure of tropical lower stratospheric
   temperature, water vapor, and ozone trends. The warming in the tropical
   upper troposphere over the past 30 years is strongest near the
   Indo-Pacific warm pool, while the warming trend in the western and
   central Pacific is much weaker. In the lower stratosphere, these trends
   are reversed: the historical cooling trend is strongest over the
   Indo-Pacific warm pool and is weakest in the western and central
   Pacific. These zonal variations are stronger than the zonal-mean
   response in boreal winter. Targeted experiments with a chemistry-climate
   model are used to demonstrate that sea surface temperature (hereafter
   SST) trends are driving the zonal asymmetry in upper tropospheric and
   lower stratospheric tropical temperature trends. Warming SSTs in the
   Indian Ocean and in the warm pool region have led to enhanced moist
   heating in the upper troposphere, and in turn to a Gill-like response
   that extends into the lower stratosphere. The anomalous circulation has
   led to zonal structure in the ozone and water vapor trends near the
   tropopause, and subsequently to less water vapor entering the
   stratosphere. The radiative impact of these changes in trace gases is
   smaller than the direct impact of the moist heating. Projected future
   SSTs appear to drive a temperature and water vapor response whose zonal
   structure is similar to the historical response. In the lower
   stratosphere, the changes in water vapor and temperature due to
   projected future SSTs are of similar strength to, though slightly weaker
   than, that due directly to projected future CO2, ozone, and methane.},

Abstract = {Satellite passive-microwave sensors provide a sensitive means of

   interpretation and can extend local observations across regional scales.
   Analysis of special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) brightness
   temperature (T-B) data supports ice-core research in two specific ways.
   First, the summer hear complex layers used to date the Holocene portion
   of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core can be defined temporally
   and spatially by SSM/I 37-GHz vertically (V) and horizontally (H)
   polarized (B) ratio (V/H) trends. Second, comparison of automatic
   weather station temperatures to SSM/I 37-GHz V T-B data shows that they
   are an effective proxy temperature record in this region. Also, the T-B
   data can be correlated with proxy temperature trends from
   stable-isotope-ratio (delta(18)O and delta D) profiles from snow pits
   and this allows the assignment of dates to specific snow depths.},

Abstract = {The relationship between winter cooling in Eurasia and Arctic
   amplification during the period 1998-2012 under global warming has
   received increasing attention in recent years. This relationship is
   controversial and is often studied using model simulations. However, the
   process of evaluating these models is challenging as a result of the
   different internal variability among models and between the models and
   observations. We applied a dynamical adjustment method based on
   constructed circulation analogs to the model simulations and
   observations to remove the effects of the internal variability of the
   atmosphere and then evaluated the performance of the models in
   simulating the winter surface air temperature (SAT) trends over Eurasia
   from 1998 to 2012 based on 11 models of the Atmospheric Model
   Intercomparison Project (AMIP) from phase 6 of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project. Our results show that the overall performance
   of all the model ensemble simulations was poor, but was much improved
   after applying dynamical adjustment, with the median values of the 11
   AMIP ensemble simulations fairly close to the observed winter SAT trends
   averaged over Eurasia. When considering both the model-simulated SAT
   trends averaged over Eurasia and the skill scores of the trend pattern,
   the HadGEM3-GC31-LL simulation gave the best performance among the
   models with multiple runs. This method allows a more objective
   evaluation of the performance of models and provides an alternative way
   to evaluate the ability of models to simulate the ``warm Arctic and cold
   Eurasia{''} trend pattern. The cold Eurasia, especially central Eurasia,
   in the observations is found to be mainly induced by the contribution
   from the internal variability of the atmosphere.},

Abstract = {Land use land cover (LULC) change has become a major concern for
   biodiversity, ecosystem alteration, and modifying the climatic pattern
   especially land surface temperature (LST). The present study assessed
   past and predicted future LULC and LST change in the Swabi District of
   Pakistan. LULC maps were generated from satellite data for years 1987,
   2002, and 2017 using supervised classification. Mean LST and its areal
   change were estimated for different LULC classes from thermal bands of
   satellite images. LULC and LST were projected for the year 2047 using
   the integrated weighted evidence-cellular automata (WE-CA) model and a
   regression equation developed in this study, respectively. LULC change
   revealed an increase of > 5\% in the built-up while a decrease in the
   agricultural area by similar to 9\%. There was an increase of similar to
   63\% area in the LST class >= 27 degrees C which may create urban heat
   island (UHI). Simulation results indicated that the built-up area will
   further be increased by similar to 3\% until 2047. Area associated with
   LST class > 30 degrees C indicated a further increase of similar to 38\%
   till 2047 with reference to year 2017. Findings of this study suggested
   proper utilization of LULC in order to mitigate the creation of UHIs
   associated with urbanization and built-up areas.},

Title = {The Effects of External Forcing and Internal Variability on the
   Formation of Interhemispheric Sea Surface Temperature Gradient Trends in
   the Indian Ocean},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {A striking trend of the Indian Ocean interhemispheric gradient in sea
   surface temperatures (SSTs) developed during the recent global warming
   hiatus. The contributions of external forcing and internal variability
   to this trend are examined in forced climate model experiments. Results
   indicate that the observed negative trend was strong by historical
   standards and most likely due to internal variability rather than to
   external forcing. Anthropogenic aerosol forcing favors negative gradient
   trends, but its effects are countered by greenhouse gas forcing, and
   both are weak relative to internal variability. The observed
   interhemispheric gradient trend occurred in parallel with a negative
   phase of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO), a linkage that is
   also found in climate models. However, the physical mechanisms
   responsible for these gradient trends in models differ from those in
   ocean reanalysis products. In particular, oceanic processes via an
   increased Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) transport into the Indian Ocean
   forced by stronger Pacific trade winds are the principal cause of the
   observed negative SST gradient trend during 2000-13. In contrast,
   atmospheric processes via changing surface wind stress over the southern
   Indian Ocean remotely forced by the IPO appear to play a dominant role
   in changing the interhemispheric SST gradients in climate models. The
   models underestimate the magnitude of the IPO and produce changes in the
   ITF that are too weak owing to their coarse spatial resolution. These
   model deficiencies may account for the differences between the
   simulations and observations.},

Title = {Climatic Trends in Temperature, Relative Humidity, and Wind Speed Over
   Indian Landmass and Isle in Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep During
   1981-2021},
Journal = {MAPAN-JOURNAL OF METROLOGY SOCIETY OF INDIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {39},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An analysis is performed to examine trends in temperature, relative
   humidity, and wind-speed over the Indian landmass and in the isles of
   Lakshadweep (Arabian Sea side) and Andaman and Nicobar (Bay of Bengal
   side) over the last four decades (from 1981 to 2021). MERRA data
   deployed for revealing the large-scale fluctuations and linear trends in
   these parameters covering 36 locations. Surface temperature (2 m above
   ground) data showed a linear rise, which is more prominent after 2000,
   both in the Arabian side and the Bay of Bengal. Over this period,
   temperature increased similar to 0.7-0.8 degrees C on both sides of
   Indian landmass. About two third locations (24 locations) in the study
   showed increase in temperature. However, relative humidity data on all
   island locations exhibited a decrease (prominent during 2000-2021).
   Quasi-periodic fluctuations in temperature (which is linearly rising)
   closely relates with the ENSO parameter (correlation coefficient `r' in
   Arabian Sea and Andaman and Nicobar ranged from similar to 0.20 to 0.34;
   which is statistically significant and relatively larger towards Andaman
   Islands). `r' increased considerably (> 0.5) during 2000-2021.
   Wind-speed, in general, showed larger magnitude over Andaman and Nicobar
   Islands (similar to 5.0 m/s yearly averaged) in comparison to Arabian
   Sea (similar to 4.0 m/s) and landmass (similar to 2.2 m/s). On the other
   hand, solar cycle (sun spot numbers) and wind-speed reflects a weak
   positive correlation coefficient (< similar to 0.40) but statistically
   significant while no consequential correlation found between solar cycle
   and relative humidity. Detailed analysis suggests that relative humidity
   decreased both over landmass and islands during 2000-2021.
   Interestingly, surface temperature increased more rapidly between
   latitudes 7.03 degrees N and 12.91 degrees N after 2000. Rise in
   temperature and long period fluctuations (> 2-3 years) in the lower
   latitudes (< 15 degrees N) showed a strong association with ENSO signal
   suggesting invigorated atmosphere ocean interaction.},

Abstract = {This study modelled the changes in the development processes of the
   health-threatening tick Ixodes ricinus in Northern Europe as driven by
   the trends of temperature (1950-2018). We used the ECA\&D dataset to
   calculate the annual accumulated temperature to obtain the development
   rates of the oviposition, incubation, larva-nymph, and nymph-adult
   molts. Annual values were used to ascertain the trend in development
   rates of each stage. The ecological classification of Northern Europe
   (LANMAP2) was used to summarize results. The temperature in 1950-2018
   clearly increased in the target territory. The development rates of
   every tested life cycle process were faster along the time series.
   Faster oviposition and incubation rates resulted in central Sweden,
   Baltic countries, and parts of Finland. Faster molting rates were
   observed in the same territories and in large areas of Western Norway.
   The trend of temperature in the period 1950-2018 shows a consistent
   inflection point around 1990, demonstrating that the increased annual
   accumulated temperature has a deeper impact on the life cycle of I.
   ricinus since approximately 1990. Faster development rates could be part
   of the processes driving the reported spread of the tick in the target
   area and should be considered as a serious threat to human health.},

Title = {Asymmetric trends in seasonal temperature variability in instrumental

Abstract = {While the rise in global mean temperature over the past several decades
   is now widely acknowledged, the issue as to whether and to what extent
   temperature variability is changing continues to undergo debate. Here,
   variability refers to the spread of the temperature distribution. Much
   attention has been given to the effects that changes in mean temperature
   have on extremes, but these changes are accompanied by changes in
   variability, and it is actually the two together, in addition to all
   aspects of a changing climate pattern, that influence extremes. Since
   extremes have some of the largest impacts on society and ecology,
   changing temperature variability must be considered in tandem with a
   gradually increasing temperature mean. Previous studies of trends in
   temperature variability have produced conflicting results. Here we
   investigated ten long-term instrumental records in Europe of minimum,
   mean and maximum temperatures, looking for trends in seasonal, annual
   and decadal measures of variability (standard deviation and various
   quantile ranges) as well as asymmetries in the trends of extreme versus
   mean temperatures via quantile regression. We found consistent and
   accelerating mean warming during 1864-2012. In the last 40 years
   (1973-2012) trends for Tmax were higher than for Tmin, reaching up to
   0.8 degrees C per 10a in spring. On the other hand, variability trends
   were not as uniform: significant changes occurred in opposing directions
   depending on the season, as well as when comparing 1864-2012 trends to
   those of 1973-2012. Moreover, if variability changed, then it changed
   asymmetrically, that is only in the part above or below the median.
   Consequently, trends in the extreme high and low quantiles differed.
   Regional differences indicated that in winter, high-alpine stations had
   increasing variability trends for Tmax especially at the upper tail
   compared to no changes or decreasing variability at low altitude
   stations. In contrast, summer variability increased at all stations
   studied.},

Title = {Recent and historical range shifts of two canopy-forming seaweeds in

Journal = {ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {51},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Geographical range shifts of two canopy-forming seaweeds, Himanthalia
   elongata (L.) S.F. Gray and Fucus serratus L. were investigated at their
   southern range boundary in Northern Spain from the end of nineteenth
   century to 2009. Given the good dispersal abilities of H. elongata and
   its short life-span, we hypothesize that this species will track
   environmental changes at a faster rate than the perennial and
   short-distance disperser E serratus. Our results show a continuous and
   drastic westward retraction of H. elongata, which has nowadays virtually
   vanished in Northern Spain, whereas E serratus is still found in the
   westernmost area. Despite this, the first species is still relatively
   abundant in the Iberian Peninsula, whereas the presence of the latter is
   scattered and reduced. Overall, range shifts fit with the warming trend
   in sea surface temperature (SST), whereas it is unlikely that increases
   in grazing pressure or coastal pollution have driven the observed
   changes, particularly the rapid trend in recent years. Differences in
   species traits are linked to range dynamics. The higher persistence of E
   serratus at eastern shores may thus be related to its longer life span
   and its greater thermal tolerance. The presence of sporadic populations
   of H. elongata outside the zone of continuous distribution can be
   attributed to long-distance dispersal events during cold pulses. Relict
   populations in isolated and estuarine locations were left behind in the
   contracting range margins, particularly for E serratus. In Northern
   Spain, the westward retreat of large canopy-forming algae seems to be a
   general phenomenon, involving other species such as kelps. Therefore, an
   evident reorganization of coastal assemblages is expected, though the
   temporal extent of changes and the consequences for ecosystem services
   need to be evaluated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

   spatiotemporal resolutions; however, their reliability must be
   quantified by spatiotemporal comparison against in situ records. Here,
   we present spatial and temporal assessments of temperature indices
   (T-max, T-min, T-mean, and DTR) products against the reference data
   during the period of 1979-2015 over Punjab Province, Pakistan. This
   region is considered as a center for agriculture and irrigated farming.
   Our study is the first spatiotemporal statistical evaluation of the
   performance and selection of potential GDPs over the study region and is
   based on statistical indicators, trend detection, and abrupt change
   analysis. Results revealed that the CRU temperature indices (T-max,
   T-min, T-mean, and DTR) outperformed the other GDPs as indicated by
   their higher CC andR(2)but lower bias and RMSE. Furthermore, trend and
   abrupt change analysis indicated the superior performances of the
   CRUTmin and T-mean products. However, the T-max and DTR products were
   less accurate for detecting trends and abrupt transitions in
   temperature. The tested GDPs as well as the reference data series
   indicate significant warming during the period of 1997-2001 over the
   study region. Differences between GDPs revealed discrepancies of 1-2
   degrees C when compared with different products within the same category
   and with reference data. The accuracy of all GDPs was particularly poor
   in the northern Punjab, where underestimates were greatest. This
   preliminary evaluation of the different GDPs will be useful for
   assessing inconsistencies and the capabilities of the products prior to
   their reliable utilization in hydrological and meteorological
   applications particularly over arid and semiarid regions.},

Abstract = {Information on the migration patterns of sperm whales (Physeter
   macrocephalus) in the North Atlantic is preserved in historical
   strandings records, particularly for the North Sea, where sperm whale
   strandings have been documented since the 16th century, reflecting
   general public interest in large whales ashore. Most strandings in this
   area occur during or following the southward migration from the feeding
   grounds, when some animals enter the North Sea (in which they are
   thought to have difficulty navigating) instead of following their usual
   route through deep water to the west of the British Isles. There was
   much speculation about the causes of the high incidence of strandings on
   North Sea coasts in the 1990s, among which a recently published analysis
   of long-term trends in strandings indicated an effect of sunspot cycle
   length. We show that long-term interannual variation in the incidence of
   sperm whale strandings on North Sea coasts is related to positive
   temperature anomalies: the incidence of strandings was higher in warmer
   periods. The effect of temperature anomalies explains between 8 and 9\%
   of variation in the strandings series. Inclusion of sunspot cycle length
   as an additional predictor did not significantly improve this model. It
   is suggested that this link with positive temperature anomalies may
   reflect changes in the distribution of the sperm whales' main squid
   prey. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   spawning grounds, with temperatures at their lowest in winter/spring and
   peaking during summer/autumn. Oocytes were heavier in winter/spring than
   in summer/autumn, showing a significant inverse correlation with the
   ambient sea surface temperature. Dry mass per oocyte was neither related
   to size of fish nor inversely related to batch fecundity. There was no
   specific relationship between batch fecundity and temperature, both high

Abstract = {Satellite microwave temperature sounding data have been widely used in
   the study of climate trends over the past decades. When merging advanced
   microwave sounding unit-A (AMSU-A) data from 1998 to 2017 from different
   satellites, brightness temperature observations can be affected by
   differences in the center frequency, incidence angle, and local equator
   crossing time (LECT) among the instruments. Atmospheric drag and gravity
   variations with latitude can also cause orbital drift that leads to
   changes in LECT of the same instrument. Inter-sensor calibration and
   diurnal correction are thus necessary before applying AMSU-A data to
   climate studies. In this study, AMSU-A data from the National Oceanic
   and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) -15, -18, and -19 satellites
   and the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological
   Satellites MetOp-A/-B collected during 1998-2017 were first
   inter-calibrated by a double difference method to remove inter-sensor
   biases. AMSU-A data from NOAA-18 was used as the reference for the
   double difference inter-sensor calibration. A diurnal correction was
   then applied to data over the Amazon rainforest to eliminate the effects
   of different LECTs. Finally, linear and nonlinear climate trends were
   calculated to show that warming (cooling) trends over the Amazon
   rainforest for window and tropospheric AMSU-A channels 1-8 and 15
   (stratospheric channels 9-14) significantly decreased (increased) if
   inter-sensor calibration and a diurnal correction was applied. The
   nonlinear climate trends reveal more rapid warming trends for
   tropospheric sounding channels 3-7 and 15 and less rapid cooling trends
   for stratospheric channels 10-12 during 1998-2008 than during 2008-2017.
   Channels 1-2 (channel 13) have cooling (warming) and warming (cooling)
   trends before and after 2008, respectively.},

Abstract = {Time series of monthly mean sea surface temperatures in the Sea of
   Okhotsk and adjacent basins have been formed from 20-year-long satellite
   measurements (1998-2017). Coefficients of the linear trend are
   determined in each spatial cell with a size of 2 x 2 km using the method
   of least squares. Such coefficients are calculated for each month
   separately, for the annual mean values, and for seasonally average
   values of the temperature. The relationship of these coefficients with
   the observed decrease in the ice cover in the Sea of Okhotsk in the last
   20 years has been analyzed. It is shown that the temperature of the
   surface layer in this basin decreases; the most significant decrease is
   observed in its northern and western parts. This trend is especially
   pronounced in the spring, which may be due to a decrease in the ice
   cover and stronger water cooling due to the winter convection when the
   area of ice cover decreases.},

Title = {Investigation of sea level anomalies related with NAO along the west

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {121},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {It is well-known that North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is one of
   the large-scaled climate modes effective in the Northern Hemisphere, has
   a considerable affect on the water resources and climatic indicators
   especially in the Mediterranean basin. In recent years, also crucial
   studies about the sea level rise in relation to climate change have been
   accelerated. Turkey has about 20 modernized tide gauge stations equipped
   with permanent GPS receivers and targets to contribute to global sea
   level rise studies in the future. The aim of this study is to find out
   the effects of North Atlantic Oscillation on the national shores using
   the data of four tide-gauge stations located on the Aegean and
   Mediterranean coasts of Turkey. Implications from these four tide gauges
   would motivate researches to take into account the effect of NAO in
   calculating the true sea level rise at the national coasts. While
   studying the sea level changes, vertical crustal movement has been
   observed using the data of tide gauge GPS stations, and this situation
   has been taken into consideration in the evaluation of sea levels.
   Besides, in order to investigate the influences of thermal expansion on
   sea levels, sea surface temperature data of the meteorology stations
   near the tide gauges have been evaluated. The homogeneity of the data
   sets was analyzed using four statistical tests. As a result, all of the
   meteorology stations' temperature series and tide gauges' data are
   subjected to trend detection after the homogeneity analysis. Eventually,
   the effects of North Atlantic Oscillation on both sea levels and sea
   surface temperatures have been introduced. The study results indicate
   high correlation between North Atlantic Oscillation and the sea level
   and sea surface temperature events. It is seen that the linear
   correlation between the sea level trends of the considered stations and
   the sea surface temperature data of the related meteorology stations is
   considerably significant.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent changes in the near-surface air temperature (nSAT) in the
   Antarctic Peninsula (AP) suggests that the absence of 21st century
   warming on Antarctic Peninsula may be coming to end. To examine this,
   the long-term annual and seasonal variability of the nSAT at eight
   Antarctic stations located in the AP are analyzed using available data
   from the SCAR Reader database, complemented with data from the Chilean
   Weather Service (Frei and O'Higgins). An exponential filter was applied
   to the original annual and seasonal mean series to obtain a decadal-like
   variation of the nSAT. A stacked and the standardized anomaly of the
   nSAT record was constructed to examine the average regional behavior in
   the AP. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) and changepoint analysis were applied
   through the stacked nSAT series to highlight significant changes caused
   by variation in weather and climate. The CUSUM and bootstrapping
   analysis revealed two statistically significant breaking points during
   the 1978-2020 period. The first one occurred in the late nineties ending
   a warming period and making the beginning of a cooling period; the
   second one may have taken place in the mid-2010s and could mark the end
   of the warming pause. These trends appear to be consistent with the
   changes observed in the large-scale climate modes (i.e., the Antarctic
   Annular Mode - AAO).},

Title = {Comparing the Upper Mesospheric Temperature Trend and the Response to
   Solar Activity Derived From the Daily Mean and Nocturnal Na Lidar
   Observations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {129},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {Over the past decades, various experimental and numerical model studies
   have indicated cooling trend in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere
   (MLT), while the magnitude of the trend varies noticeably. Previous
   studies using the lidar observations derived the temperature trends and
   solar responses solely from the traditional nocturnal measurements.
   While these archived results are more or less in agreement with modeling
   studies, one of the main uncertainties in these studies is the potential
   biases induced by the trends of the diurnal tide forced in the lower
   atmosphere, and that of the in situ exothermal reactions involving the
   photolysis. In the MLT, the diurnal tide has significant seasonal
   variations, considerable amplitude and is one of the dominant dynamic
   sources. However, its potential effects in the trend studies have rarely
   been discussed. In this paper, we present and compare the long-term
   temperature trends in the upper mesosphere utilizing the daily mean and
   nightly mean temperature profiles measured by a Sodium (Na) Doppler
   lidar at midlatitude. The system was operating routinely in full diurnal
   cycles between 2002 and 2017, obtaining a unique multi-year temperature
   data set. A customized multi-linear regression (MLR) model is applied to
   determine the linear trends and the other fitting parameters, such as
   ENSO and solar F10.7 responses in the upper mesosphere. This study
   indicates the daily mean cooling trend between 84 and 98 km is larger
   than that of nightly mean trend by similar to-1 K/decade, while
   differences in the solar response are within the fitting uncertainties.},

Title = {Weakening of Antarctic stratospheric planetary wave activities in early
   austral spring since the early 2000s: a response to sea surface
   temperature trends},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Using multiple reanalysis datasets and modeling simulations, the trends
   of Antarctic stratospheric planetary wave activities in early austral
   spring since the early 2000s are investigated in this study. We find
   that the stratospheric planetary wave activities in September have
   weakened significantly since the year 2000, which is mainly related to
   the weakening of the tropospheric wave sources in the extratropical
   Southern Hemisphere. As the Antarctic ozone also shows clear shift
   around the year 2000, the impact of ozone recovery on Antarctic
   planetary wave activity is also examined through numerical simulations.
   Significant ozone recovery in the lower stratosphere changes the
   atmospheric state for wave propagation to some extent, inducing a slight
   decrease in the vertical wave flux in upper troposphere and lower
   stratosphere (UTLS). However, the changes in the wave propagation
   environment in the middle and upper stratosphere over the subpolar
   region are not significant. The ozone recovery has a minor contribution
   to the significant weakening of stratospheric planetary wave activity in
   September. Further analysis indicates that the trend of September sea
   surface temperature (SST) over 20 degrees N-70 degrees S is well linked
   to the weakening of stratospheric planetary wave activities. The model
   simulations reveal that the SST trend in the extratropical Southern
   Hemisphere (20-70 degrees S) and the tropics (20-20 degrees S) induce a
   weakening of the wave 1 component of tropospheric geopotential height in
   the extratropical Southern Hemisphere, which subsequently leads to a
   decrease in stratospheric wave flux. In addition, both reanalysis data
   and numerical simulations indicate that the Brewer-Dobson circulation
   (BDC) related to wave activities in the stratosphere has also been
   weakening in early austral spring since the year 2000 due to the trend
   of September SST in the tropics and extratropical Southern Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {We report the development of a tetraethylenepentamine
   (tepa)-functionalized Mg-2(dobpdc) (T02, T2, T20, and T200; the number
   denotes equivalents of tepa used with respect to the framework), which
   uncommonly exhibited a gradual increase in CO2 uptake with increasing
   temperature when polyamine groups were heavily loaded into the framework
   (T20 and T200). For the moderately loaded sample (T2), a significant
   working capacity (11.2 wt\%) and a cyclable CO2 performance at 40
   degrees C and 15\% CO2 pressure were obtained. The abrupt increase
   observed in the CO2 isotherms indicates that the tepa-loaded samples
   involve a CO2 insertion mechanism. Interestingly, all amine groups in
   tepa can partly participate in the formation of ammonium carbamate ion
   pairs, which is the first observation of this in amine-functionalized
   metal-organic frameworks. Remarkably, we demonstrate that high loading
   of tepa allowed for selective CO2 uptake over H2O vapors, together with
   enhanced framework stability under humid conditions.},

Abstract = {India's energy capital-Singrauli, has conglomeration of various thermal
   power plants and operational coal mines. Earlier, the area was densely
   forested, rich in biodiversity and home to various tribal communities.
   In the last decade, the area has been exploited by the private sector
   for setting up large scale power generation plants. The land use and its
   pattern and land surface temperature (LST) were studied for the Sasan
   Ultra Mega Thermal Power Plant covering an area of 10 km(2) for 3
   years-2005, 2010 and 2015, respectively. Chronologically, the year 2005
   is the phase of pre-establishment of the thermal power plant; the year
   2010 specifies the construction phase and 2015 is the operational phase.
   Landsat ETM and Landsat 8 data of remote sensing system were used for
   this study. The land use/cover (LULC) study shows a significant decrease
   in the forest cover and barren rocky land, and a dramatic expansion in
   vegetation and wastelands. These changes in LULC have together widened
   the range of LST with an overall rise of 6.69 degrees C and an overall
   decline in the NDVI value from the year 2005 to 2015. The results of
   Pearson's correlation analysis depict an inverse co-relationship between
   LST and NDVI for the study area. Therefore, LST and NDVI are two
   important parameters to study the metropolitan ecosystem and can be used
   as an effective tool for evaluating environmental influence on
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Melting of major Glaciers in the western Himalayas: evidence of climatic
   changes from long term MSU derived tropospheric temperature trend
   (1979-2008)},
Journal = {ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {27},
Number = {12},
Pages = {4505-4519},
Abstract = {Global warming or the increase of the surface and atmospheric
   temperatures of the Earth, is increasingly discernible in the polar,
   sub-polar and major land glacial areas. The Himalayan and Tibetan
   Plateau Glaciers, which are the largest glaciers outside of the Polar
   Regions, are showing a large-scale decrease of snow cover and an
   extensive glacial retreat. These glaciers such as Siachen and Gangotri
   are a major water resource for Asia as they feed major rivers such as
   the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra. Due to scarcity of ground measuring
   stations, the long-term observations of atmospheric temperatures
   acquired from the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) since 1979-2008 is
   highly useful. The lower and middle tropospheric temperature trend based
   on 30 years of MSU data shows warming of the Northern Hemisphere's
   mid-latitude regions. The mean month-to-month warming (up to 0.048 +/-
   0.026 degrees K/year or 1.44 degrees K over 30 years) of the mid
   troposphere (near surface over the high altitude Himalayas and Tibetan
   Plateau) is prominent and statistically significant at a 95\% confidence
   interval. Though the mean annual warming trend over the Himalayas (0.016
   +/- 0.005 degrees K/year), and Tibetan Plateau (0.008 +/- 0.006 degrees
   K/year) is positive, the month to month warming trend is higher (by 2-3
   times, positive and significant) only over a period of six months
   (December to May). The factors responsible for the reversal of this
   trend from June to November are discussed here. The inequality in the
   magnitude of the warming trends of the troposphere between the western
   and eastern Himalayas and the IG (Indo-Gangetic) plains is attributed to
   the differences in increased aerosol loading (due to dust storms) over
   these regions. The monthly mean lower-tropospheric MSU-derived
   temperature trend over the IG plains (dust sink region; up to 0.032 +/-
   0.027 degrees K/year) and dust source regions (Sahara desert, Middle
   East, Arabian region, Afghanistan-Iran-Pakistan and Thar Desert regions;
   up to 0.068 +/- 0.033 degrees K/year) also shows a similar pattern of
   month-to-month oscillation and six months of enhanced and a
   statistically significant warming trend. The enhanced warming trend
   during the winter and pre-monsoon months (December-May) may accelerate
   glacial melt. The unequal distribution of the warming trend over the
   year is discussed in this study and is partially attributed to a number
   of controlling factors such as sunlight duration, CO2 trends over the
   region (2003-2008), water vapor and aerosol distribution.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal analysis of temperature variability, trend, and
   magnitude in the Hindu Kush region using Monte Carlo and Sen's slope
   approaches},

Abstract = {The present study explores the spatial and temporal deviations in
   temperature using Monte Carlo (MC) and Sen's slope (SS) approaches in
   the Hindu Kush (HK) region. Climate change holds sturdy association
   against the temperature trend that has generated adverse impacts in the
   form of floods. In this attempt, for trend analysis, temperature has
   been selected as a meteorological parameter. This study mainly focuses
   on exploring the tendency in average temperature with respect to time
   and the consequential flood recurrences in the region. For the current
   study, data regarding temperature were typically collected from Pakistan
   Meteorological Department. In the study region, there are a total of
   seven meteorological station falls namely Dir. Chitral, Drosh, Saidu,
   Malam Jabba, Kalam, and Timergara. The temperature time series data was
   calculated and analyzed using MC and SS approaches for trend detection
   in order to demonstrate the kind of fluctuation in the Hindu Kush
   region. The resultant analysis further revealed that in the
   meteorological station of Dir, a more significant positive trend (alpha
   = 0.0001) was found in mean monthly maximum, minimum, and monthly normal
   temperature. Likewise, at Drosh, a positive trend is detected in mean
   monthly maximum (alpha = 0.04), monthly minimum (alpha = 0.003), and
   monthly average (alpha = 0.0005). Moreover, at Saidu met station, there
   is also a trend detected in temperature sub-variables such as monthly
   maximum (alpha = 0.0001) and monthly minimum (alpha = 0.001). In
   addition to these, at Kalam, there is a temperature trend noted for
   monthly minimum (alpha= 0.01) and monthly average (alpha= 0.02).
   Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that there is no trend detected
   in the remaining stations, i.e., Chitral, Malam Jabba, Drosh, and
   Timergara. The overall analysis discovered that there is a sturdy
   relationship between climate change phenomenon and temperature
   variability. After using SS test to the temperature data of mean monthly
   maximum (TMMMax), the results explored that Kalam station grips the
   highest magnitude, i.e., Q = 0.76; however, Timergara shows the
   lowermost, i.e., Q = -0.34. For the monthly minimum temperature
   (TMIVLMin), at Kalam again, the highest value (Q = 0.005) was detected;
   however, other stations revealed a negative trend, except Drosh which
   express no change in terms of magnitude. Similarly, in terms of monthly
   normal temperature (TMNor), Timergara station (Q = - 0.4) verified a
   negative trend magnitude and Malam Jabba station again trendless. Among
   all, the met station of Malam Jabba which holds an altitude of 2591 m is
   a hilly station just followed by Kalam having 2103 m height; however,
   Dir holds 1375 m height and the rest of the met stations show low
   elevation. The main reason for the temperature difference is the
   altitude of the study region.},

Abstract = {In this study, an improved method named spatial disaggregation and
   detrended bias correction (SDDBC) based on spatial disaggregation and
   bias correction (SDBC) combined with trend correction was proposed.
   Using data from meteorological stations over China from 1991 to 2020 and
   the seasonal hindcast data from the Beijing Climate Center Climate
   System Model (BCC\_CSM1.1 (m)), the performances of the model, SDBC, and
   SDDBC in spring temperature forecasts were evaluated. The results showed
   that the observed spring temperature exhibits a significant increasing
   trend in most of China, but the warming trend simulated by the model was
   obviously smaller. SDBC performed poorly in temperature trend
   correction. With SDDBC, the model's deviation in temperature trend was
   corrected, and consequently, the temporal correlation between the
   model's simulation and the observation as well as the forecasting skill
   on the phase of temperature were improved, thus improving the MSSS and
   the ACC. From the perspective of probabilistic prediction, the relative
   operating characteristic skill score (ROCSS) and the Brier skill score
   (BSS) of the SDDBC for three categorical forecasts were higher than
   those of the model and SDBC. The SDDBC's BSS increased as the effect of
   the increasing resolution component was greater than that of the
   decreasing reliability component. Therefore, it is necessary to correct
   the predicted temperature trend in post-processing for the output of
   numerical prediction models.},

Title = {Generating isocoulombic reactions as a tool for systematic evaluation of
   temperature trends of thermodynamic properties: Application to
   aquocomplexes of lanthanides and actinides},
Journal = {GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA},

Abstract = {Most of the available thermodynamic data concerning radioactive waste
   disposal are restricted to values of reaction equilibrium constants
   (logK(298)degrees) at 25 degrees C and 1 bar. Simple estimation methods
   such as isocoulombic reactions can be used for extrapolating the
   properties of reactions involving aqueous species and minerals to
   elevated temperatures. The aim of this study was to validate the
   applicability of various alternative isocoulombic reactions to estimate
   logK(T)degrees values of aqueous complexation reactions for lanthanides
   and actinides to elevated temperatures while taking advantage of new
   additional literature data, and to identify criteria for choosing the
   ``best{''} reactions. For each chemical species of interest, a
   systematic approach using dedicated software and database allowed us to
   identify the isocoulombic reactions and types of extrapolation that
   yield the best estimates of standard thermodynamic properties at
   elevated temperatures, when very limited or no experimental data are
   available. We have tested aqueous complexation reactions for selected
   lanthanides and actinides of different valences with chloride, fluoride,
   sulfate, carbonate, nitrate, phosphate and silicate ligands. ``Model{''}
   complexation reactions, having known temperature trends, were
   systematically combined with complex formation reactions of interest
   whose temperature trends are unknown, into many alternative isocoulombic
   reactions. For each ion, we investigated which of the generated
   isocoulombic reactions provide the best estimates for log(e)K degrees(T)
   of the reaction of interest at elevated temperatures in order to compile
   the guidelines for choosing the optimal ones, then applying these
   guidelines to ``prediction{''} subsets. In most cases, knowing only
   log(e)K degrees(T) at 25 degrees C (for the reaction of interest), it
   was possible to obtain rather accurate estimates of log(e)K degrees(T)
   values at elevated temperatures using isocoulombic reactions that
   exchange ions with similar charge and hydration properties (hydrated
   ionic radius and structure of the hydration shell) and known log(m)K
   degrees(T) of model reactions. These ions and their complexes interact
   with the solvent in comparable ways, so that their similar heat capacity
   and entropy effects largely cancel out on both sides of an ``optimal{''}
   isocoulombic reaction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   significant debate about whether the causes are of natural or

   -0.03K over the period 2008-2012. Thus while these eruptions do cause a
   cooling of the Earth and may therefore contribute to the slow-down in
   global warming, they do not appear to be the sole or primary cause.},

Title = {Ontogenetic and seasonal trends in recent growth rates of Atlantic cod
   and haddock larvae on Georges Bank: effects of photoperiod and
   temperature},
Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {325},
Pages = {205-226},
Abstract = {Growth rate is a key demographic factor affecting survival and
   recruitment of marine fishes. Yet in the field, the patterns of change
   in growth rate with development and the effects of environmental
   variability on growth are poorly understood. We examined several factors
   that may contribute to the observed variability in recent (i.e. 2 to 4 d
   before sampling) growth and survival of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua and
   haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus larvae on the southern flank of Georges
   Bank for the years 1995 through 1999. For both species, strong
   ontogenetic and seasonal trends in larval growth rates were apparent. A
   rapid initial increase in specific growth rate with larval size was
   observed in both species, followed by a stanza with little change in
   specific growth rate and finally a gradual increase with size to a
   maximum specific growth rate. For larva of any given size, growth rate
   increased as the season progressed. A variety of models were used to
   explore and describe the relations among growth rate, larval size,
   photoperiod, temperature and other variables. Generalized additive
   models (GAMs) with both larval size (protein content) and photoperiod
   terms explained 48 \% and 61 \% of the variability observed in recent
   growth of cod and haddock, respectively. Residuals from these models
   were used to examine the effects of other factors on estimated growth
   rates. Salinity, water density (sigma-t, sigma(t)), distance along the
   Bank, bottom depth, temperature (T) and residual T (observed T minus the
   long-term mean for a given day of the year) explained small but
   significant portions of the residual variability in larval growth rates.
   These data and other considerations suggest that, while both increasing
   photoperiod and temperature contribute to the increase in larval growth
   rates observed each spring, photoperiod rather than temperature was the
   better proxy for the seasonal trend in larval growth rates between March
   and May on Georges Bank. Feeding conditions and growth of larval
   Atlantic cod and haddock were poor during the late winter and spring of
   1995 compared with those from 1997 to 1999.},

Volume = {78},

Abstract = {Based on observed monthly mean temperatures, it is possible to construct
   a simple mathematical model of the annual variation of daily mean
   temperature, the annual temperature wave. For periods of 15 years, the
   model gives a good correlation with the observed monthly values. The
   model may be used as a tool for the generation of daily mean
   temperatures for the corresponding period. It is continuous,
   differentiable and strictly monotonous between the unique maximum and
   the minimum of the curve. Consequently, climate quantities of interest
   for each period can be calculated by the means of simple mathematical
   analyses. The model was tested by reproducing values for quantities such
   as annual mean temperature, winter mean temperature, summer mean
   temperature and temperature sums. Model calculated values, fit values
   calculated directly from observed data well. The model was also tested
   by comparing results from two different but neighbouring stations. There
   was a good correlation between the results from the two stations. Long
   homogenised time series with 130 years of monthly mean temperature from
   seven Norwegian stations were analysed by means of the model. It was
   found that the Frost Free Season Length and the Growth Season Length had
   increased for all stations by 10-20 days/100 years in the period
   1871-1990. The Summer Half-year Length, even if it was defined relative
   to the annual mean temperature, also increased for all stations by 4-9
   days/100 years. The Hot Season Length showed positive trends as well,
   and for the five stations in Southern Norway, the trends were as high as
   18-29 days/100 years. The Heat Sum had increased by 6-11\% for southern
   stations and 20-22\% for the northern stations. The results indicate
   that the level as well as the shape of the annual temperature wave
   changed in the period from 1871 to 1990. Some of the results for the
   period 1990-1999 diverge substantially from the trends, possibly
   indicating significant changes in the shape of the annual temperature
   wave in this last period.},

Title = {The impact of the Madden-Julian Oscillation trend on the Arctic
   amplification of surface air temperature during the 1979-2008 boreal
   winter},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},

Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {One of the most prominent and important features of climate change is
   that surface air temperature (SAT) change is greatest at high latitudes.
   The cause for this Arctic amplification of SAT is uncertain. Using
   ERA-Interim reanalysis data, we show that Arctic amplification during
   the past 30 years (1979 to 2008) is linked to the Madden-Julian
   Oscillation (MJO), the primary mode of intraseasonal variability in the
   tropics. Specifically, it is shown that interdecadal changes in the
   frequency of occurrence of individual MJO phases have had considerable
   influence on the Arctic warming during the boreal winter. During that
   time period, MJO phases 4-6 exhibited a large increase and phases 1-2 a
   moderate decrease in their frequency of occurrence. Time lagged
   composites of the SAT show that MJO phases 4-6, which correspond to
   enhanced localized tropical heating, are followed 1-2 weeks later by
   Arctic warming. Similarly, MJO phases 1-2, which are associated with
   more zonally uniform tropical heating, are followed by Arctic cooling.
   These relationships between the Arctic SAT and the spatial structure of
   the tropical heating are consistent with the poleward propagation
   mechanism of Lee et al. (2011a, 2011b). By incorporating both the trend
   in MJO phase and the intraseasonal SAT anomaly associated with the MJO,
   it was found that the MJO-induced SAT trend accounts for 10-20\% of the
   observed Arctic amplification over the Arctic Ocean. Citation: Yoo, C.,

Title = {Evaluation of multidimensional simulations of summer air temperature in

Journal = {ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To determine whether the capability of the CMIP6 version of Beijing
   Climate Center (BCC) models (BCC-ESM1 and BCC-CSM2-MR) in simulating
   China summer surface air temperature (SAT) has improved, we presented a
   multidimensional evaluation of the summer SAT in China including the
   trends, modes, and influencing factors. Critical comparisons are also
   made with the results of CMIP5 (BCC-CSM1.1 and BCC-CSM1.1m). In general,
   the CMIP6, especially BCC-CSM2-MR, has smaller deviations in the trends,
   the means, the mutations, the maximum centers, the variances, and the
   spatial patterns of the dominant modes from observatio relative to those
   of CMIP5. However, the BCC CMIP6 models still underestimate the SAT
   variation in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the northeastern regions of
   China, and the performance is unsatisfactory with respect to the
   physical drivers of the dominant modes. Importantly, all the BCC models
   can capture the spatio-temporal characteristics of the first mode well
   and can, in general, characterize the spatial pattern of the second
   mode, but none of the models perform well in the principal component of
   the second mode (PC2) due to the low performance with respect to the
   interannual variation of PC2. Furthermore, the factors influencing the
   leading two modes are evaluated. The two CMIP6 can simulate better the
   Northern Hemisphere subtropical high northern boundary affecting the
   first mode. Another factor, the Asia polar vortex area, can only be
   simulated better by two low-resolution models (BCC-CSM1.1 and BCC-ESM1).
   For the second mode, all four models simulate the influence of Asian
   zonal circulation well, but poorly simulate that of the southern Indian
   Ocean dipole due to a large deviation in the Indian Ocean surface
   temperature.},

Abstract = {This paper is the summary report on work started in 2007, and initially
   introduced in a presentation at the joint ASME - TTCI Bearing Symposium
   in Chicago in September of 2007 {[}1]. The identification of the root
   cause(s) for ``warm bearing trend{''} temperatures has also been the
   subject of other technical papers {[}2, 3].
   Traditional railroad journal bearing hot box detector (HBD) systems
   monitor journal bearing temperatures, and typically provide an alarm
   based on a measured in-service bearing absolute temperature, or against
   a programmed ``delta{''} over the ambient temperature level. More
   recently, bearing operating temperatures have been statistically
   analyzed for temperature ``trending{''}, and identification of
   temperature ``outliers{''}, or bearings which display a higher
   temperature relative to the majority of bearings in the same train. AAR
   rules now facilitate the removal from service of bearings which either:
   1) exceed traditionally defined limits, or 2) meet the statistical
   criteria set forth by these newly established AAR industry rules, to
   ideally prevent or eliminate ``burn off journals{''} and potential
   derailments.
   This study is focused on testing of railroad journal bearings that were
   removed from service for ``Why Made Code 50{''} (an ``overheated{''}
   journal bearing), and exhibited no visually obvious external signs of
   distress. Dynamic testing and a corresponding tear down investigation to
   determine the root cause(s) for the elevated temperature was performed
   for the trend and mate bearings. This dynamic rig testing and
   corresponding investigation(s) have resulted in the determination of a
   significant and potential root cause for warm trend bearings.},

Title = {How Useful Are Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   Observations for Inland Water Temperature Monitoring and Warming Trend
   Assessment in Temperate Lakes in Poland?},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Continuous software development and widespread access to satellite
   imagery allow for obtaining increasingly accurate data on the natural
   environment. They play an important role in hydrosphere research, and
   one of the most frequently addressed issues in the era of climate change
   is the thermal dynamics of its components. Interesting research
   opportunities in this area are provided by the utilization of data
   obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS).
   These data have been collected for over two decades and have already
   been used to study water temperature in lakes. In the case of Poland,
   there is a long history of studying the thermal regime of lakes based on
   in situ observations, but so far, MODIS data have not been used in these
   studies. In this study, the available products, such as 1-day and 8-day
   MODIS land surface temperature (LST), were validated. The obtained data
   were compared with in situ measurements, and the reliability of using
   these data to estimate long-term thermal changes in lake waters was also
   assessed. The analysis was conducted based on the example of two coastal
   lakes located in Poland. The results of 1-day LST MODIS generally showed
   a good fit compared to in situ measurements (average RMSE 1.9 degrees
   C). However, the analysis of long-term trends of water temperature
   changes revealed diverse results compared to such an approach based on
   field measurements. This situation is a result of the limited number of
   satellite data, which is dictated by environmental factors associated
   with high cloud cover reaching 60\% during the analysis period.},

Abstract = {Characterization of stream flow is essential to water resource
   management, water supply planning, environmental protection, and
   ecological restoration; while air temperature variation due to climate
   change can exacerbate stream flow and add instability to the flow. In
   this study, the wavelet analysis technique was employed to identify
   temporal trend of air temperature and its impact upon forest stream
   flows in Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMRAV). Four surface
   water monitoring stations, which locate near the headwater areas with
   very few land use disturbances and the long-term data records (60-90
   years) in the LMRAV, were selected to obtain stream discharge and air
   temperature data. The wavelet analysis showed that air temperature had
   an increasing temporal trend around its mean value during the past
   several decades in the LMRAV, whereas stream flow had a decreasing
   temporal trend around its average value at the same time period in the
   same region. Results of this study demonstrated that the climate in the
   LMRAV did get warmer as time elapsed and the streams were drier as a
   result of warmer air temperature. This study further revealed that the
   best way to estimate the temporal trends of air temperature and stream
   flow was to perform the wavelet transformation around their mean values.

Abstract = {Multidecadal variability and long-term trends of Sea Surface Temperature
   (SST) and Sea Level (SL) datasets for the southeastern Bay of Biscay
   have been examined. The SST dataset (Aquarium of San Sebastian),
   measured on a nearly daily basis, extends from 1947 to 2010. The daily
   SL data utilised are those from Santander (IEO tide gauge network) and
   from St. Jean de Luz (SHOM), spanning the periods 1943-2004 and
   1964-1997, respectively. This paper presents an approach for the
   extraction of multidecadal variability and long-term trends. First of
   all, the KZA (Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Adaptive) filter was used to detect
   possible discontinuities in time-series. Subsequently, the seasonal and
   multidecadal variability was identified by spectral analysis and further
   quantified by least squares fitting. Finally, prior to the trend
   determination, the long-term natural variability was removed. The
   results revealed significant contribution of the annual component to the
   SST and SL, with a weaker contribution of the semiannual signal. The sea
   level air pressure and long-term tides also contributed to the SL
   variability. The estimated trends were less than those obtained by other
   authors. The analysis revealed no trend in the SST and the Jean de Luz
   SL series, whilst an increasing trend was detected for the Santander SL
   dataset. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {It is well known that the superconducting transition temperature (T-c)
   of cuprate superconductors can be enhanced by varying certain structural
   and electronic parameters, such as the flatness of the CuO2 planes or
   their doping level. We determine the uniaxial and hydrostatic pressure
   derivatives of T-c in the structurally simple tetragonal compound
   HgBa2CuO4+delta near optimal doping. Our results provide experimental
   evidence for two further methods to enhance T-c: (i) reducing the area
   of the CuO2 planes, and (ii) increasing the separation of the CuO2
   planar groups. T-c is found to couple much more strongly to the ratio
   c/a of the lattice constants than to the unit cell volume. A comparison
   with prior results for structurally more complicated cuprates reveals a
   general trend of uniaxial pressure derivatives with T-c.},

Abstract = {Nature has been adversely affected by increasing industrialization
   -especially after the latter half of the last century when accelerating
   technological development, unplanned urbanization, incorrect
   agricultural policies, deforestation, and the excessive and unsuitable
   use of energy have acted as factors to increase the release of gases
   into the environment. The global warming effect of greenhouse gases has
   had a negative impact on the meteorological and hydro-meteorological
   parameters, such as the temperature and precipitation, which are the
   main elements of a region's climate. In particular, sudden changes
   occurring in air temperature lead to major changes in the design of air
   conditioning systems, energy analysis, and heating-and cooling-load
   calculations such as degree-day. Various energyforecasting methods are
   being developed for air-conditioning systems in buildings, animal
   shelters and controlled environmental agriculture structures. Accurate
   and easily accessible climatic data are extremely important in terms of
   analysing the accuracy and energy efficiency of air conditioning
   systems. In this study, the trends and changes over a long period of
   daily maximum, minimum and mean temperature data were analyzed using the
   Mann-Kendall trend test and linear regression analysis, and comments
   have been made about nine provinces in the Southeastern Anatolia Region
   of Turkey. As a result of these analyses, it has been concluded that
   maximum temperatures of the provinces of Adiyaman, Gaziantep, Mardin,
   Sanliurfa, the mean temperatures of the provinces of Adiyaman, Batman,
   Gaziantep, Kilis, Mardin, Siirt, Sanliurfa and Sirnak, and the minimum
   temperatures in the provinces of Gaziantep, Kilis show statistically
   significant rising trends.},

Title = {Temperature decadal trends, and their relation to diurnal variations in
   the lower thermosphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, based on
   measurements from SABER on TIMED},
Journal = {ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {327-339},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {We have derived the behavior of decadal temperature trends over the 24 h
   of local time, based on zonal averages of SABER data, for the years 2012
   to 2014, from 20 to 100 km, within 48 degrees of the Equator. Similar
   results have not been available previously. We find that the temperature
   trends, based on zonal mean measurements at a fixed local time, can be
   different from those based on measurements made at a different fixed
   local time. The trends can vary significantly in local time, even from
   hour to hour. This agrees with some findings based on nighttime lidar
   measurements. This knowledge is relevant because the large majority of
   temperature measurements, especially in the stratosphere, are made by
   instruments on sun-synchronous operational satellites which measure at
   only one or two fixed local times, for the duration of their missions.
   In these cases, the zonal mean trends derived from various satellite
   data are tied to the specific local times at which each instrument
   samples the data, and the trends are then also biased by the local time.
   Consequently, care is needed in comparing trends based on various
   measurements with each other, unless the data are all measured at the
   same local time. Similar caution is needed when comparing with models,
   since the zonal means from 3D models reflect averages over both
   longitude and the 24 h of local time. Consideration is also needed in
   merging data from various sources to produce generic, continuous,
   longer-term records. Diurnal variations of temperature themselves, in
   the form of thermal tides, are well known and are due to absorption of
   solar radiation. We find that at least part of the reason that
   temperature trends are different for different local times is that the
   amplitudes and phases of the tides themselves follow trends over the
   same time span of the data. Many of the past efforts have focused on the
   temperature values with local time when merging data from various
   sources and on the effect of unintended satellite orbital drifts, which
   result in drifting local times at which the temperatures are measured.
   However, the effect of local time on trends has not been well
   researched. We also derive estimates of trends by simulating the drift
   of local time due to drifting orbits. Our comparisons with results found
   by others (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, AMSU; lidar) are favorable
   and informative. They may explain, at least in part, the bridge between
   results based on daytime AMSU data and nighttime lidar measurements.
   However, these examples do not form a pattern, and more comparisons and
   study are needed.},

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {73},

Abstract = {A sea surface temperature (SST) data set was recently reconstructed for
   the China Seas and their adjacent waters (100-150 degrees E, 0-50
   degrees N). Hereafter, we refer to this new regional data set as SST-CS.
   SST-CS has a monthly temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 1
   degrees latitude by 1 degrees longitude for the period from January 1960
   to December 2012. This data set is merged by SST observations from the
   State Oceanic Administration (SOA) of China and the SST observations
   from Release 2.5 of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere
   Data Set (ICOADS R2.5) from 1960-2012. SST-CS has improved the data
   coverage over the China Seas (105-130 degrees E, 15-45 degrees N)
   compared with ICOADS R2.5. Results show that SST-CS is more consistent
   with SST observations over the China Seas than COBE SST2 and HadISST1,
   especially in the offshore areas, and can better capture the temporal
   and spatial variability of SST in the China Seas. The warming rate of
   the annual mean SST derived from SST-CS is about 0.153 degrees C every
   10 yr for the past 53 yr over the China Seas. Regarding seasonal
   variation, the most significant warming trend appears in winter, about
   0.181 degrees C per 10 yr, and the lowest warming trend occurs in summer
   (0.102 degrees C per 10 yr). SST-CS can provide a more suitable and
   available data source for climatic and oceanographic studies in the
   China Seas and their adjacent waters.},

Abstract = {During the second half of the 20th century, in the littoral and
   pre-littoral areas of the Valencia region, the diurnal temperature range
   (DTR) registered a significant drop in summer (July and August).
   Meanwhile, in the same period in the lower Ebro Valley (Ebro
   Observatory), to the north of the Valencia region, the maximum
   temperature and DTR increased steeply. In order to explain the DTR drop
   in the coastal areas of the Valencia region, some studies have proposed
   an increase in the summer sea-surface temperature (SST) and others have
   attributed it to the urban heat island effect. Nevertheless, this drop
   occurred well before the current climate change was evident and
   therefore, before the rise of the SST. Furthermore, regarding the second
   proposed explanation, the drop in the DTR does not disappear when
   working with selected stations away from heavily urbanized areas. In
   this work, we propose that both the DTR rise at the Ebro Observatory and
   the DTR drop in the Valencia region are linked to the same process:
   changes in atmospheric circulation on a synoptic-scale in the North
   Atlantic that occurred in the late 1960s.},

Title = {Trends in Temperature-associated Mortality in Sao Paulo (Brazil) between

Abstract = {Exposure to non-optimal temperatures remains the single most deathful
   direct climate change impact to health. The risk varies based on the
   adaptation capacity of the exposed population which can be driven by
   climatic and/or non-climatic factors subject to fluctuations over time.
   We investigated temporal changes in the exposure-response relationship
   between daily mean temperature and mortality by cause of death, sex,
   age, and ethnicity in the megacity of Sao Paulo, Brazil (2000-2018). We
   fitted a quasi-Poisson regression model with time-varying
   distributed-lag non-linear model (tv-DLNM) to obtain annual estimates.
   We used two indicators of adaptation: trends in the annual minimum
   mortality temperature (MMT), i.e., temperature at which the mortality
   rate is the lowest, and in the cumulative relative risk (cRR) associated
   with extreme cold and heat. Finally, we evaluated their association with
   annual mean temperature and annual extreme cold and heat, respectively
   to assess the role of climatic and non-climatic drivers. In total, we
   investigated 4,471,000 deaths from non-external causes. We found
   significant temporal trends for both the MMT and cRR indicators. The
   former was decoupled from changes in AMT, whereas the latter showed some
   degree of alignment with extreme heat and cold, suggesting the role of
   both climatic and non-climatic adaptation drivers. Finally, changes in
   MMT and cRR varied substantially by sex, age, and ethnicity, exposing
   disparities in the adaptation capacity of these population groups. Our
   findings support the need for group-specific interventions and regular
   monitoring of the health risk to non-optimal temperatures to inform
   urban public health policies.},

Abstract = {Periodicity of temperature on three stations in the Nisava River valley

   spectral component to Mediterranean oscillation, starting in 1980s.
   Combined periodogram of Mediterranean oscillation index reveals 6-7
   years spectral component as a dominant mode in period 1949-2014. Wavelet
   power spectra and partial combined periodograms show absence of 6-7
   years component before 1975, after which this component becomes dominant

Abstract = {Perrone and Mikhailov (2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024193) and
   Mikhailov et al. (2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA023909) have
   recently examined thermospheric and ionospheric long-term trends using a
   data set of four thermospheric parameters (T-ex, {[}O], {[}N-2], and
   {[}O-2]) and solar EUV flux. These data were derived from one single
   ionospheric parameter, foF1, using a nonlinear fitting procedure
   involving a photochemical model for the F1 peak. The F1 peak is assumed
   at the transition height ht with the linear recombination for atomic
   oxygen ions being equal to the quadratic recombination for molecular
   ions. This procedure has a number of obvious problems that are not
   addressed or not sufficiently justified. The potentially large
   ambiguities and biases in derived parameters make them unsuitable for
   precise quantitative ionospheric and thermospheric long-term trend
   studies. Furthermore, we assert that Perrone and Mikhailov (2017,
   https://doi. org/10.1002/2017JA024193) conclusions regarding incoherent
   scatter radar (ISR) ion temperature analysis for long-term trend studies
   are incorrect and in particular are based on a misunderstanding of the
   nature of the incoherent scatter radar measurement process. Large ISR
   data sets remain a consistent and statistically robust method for
   determining long term secular plasma temperature trends.
   Plain Language Summary We comment on several studies on thermospheric
   and ionospheric long-term trends using a data set of four thermospheric
   parameters (Tex, {[}O], {[}N2], and {[}O2]) and solar EUV flux. These
   data were derived from one single ionospheric parameter, foF1, using a
   nonlinear fitting procedure involving a photochemical model. We point
   out a number of obvious problems of the procedure and question the
   validity of the data sets for any meaningful long-term trend studies. In
   addition, we assert that Perrone and Mikhailov (2017, ) conclusions
   regarding incoherent scatter radar (ISR) ion temperature analysis for
   long-term trend studies are incorrect and in particular are based on a
   misunderstanding of the nature of the incoherent scatter radar
   measurement process; large ISR data sets remain a consistent and

Abstract = {This paper estimates the sampling error variances of gridded monthly
   U.S. Historical Climatology Network, version 2 (USHCN V2),
   time-of-observation-biases (TOB)-adjusted data. The analysis of mean
   surface air temperature (SAT) assesses uncertainties, trends, and the
   rankings of the hottest and coldest years for the contiguous United
   States in the period of 1895-2008. Data from the USHCN stations are
   aggregated onto a 2.5 degrees x 3.5 degrees latitude-longitude grid by
   an arithmetic mean of the stations inside a grid box. The sampling error
   variances of the gridded monthly data are estimated for every month and
   every grid box with data. The gridded data and their sampling error
   variances are used to calculate the contiguous U.S. averages and their
   trends and associated uncertainties. The sampling error variances are
   smaller (mostly less than 0.2 degrees C-2) over the eastern United
   States, where the station density is greater and larger (with values of
   1.3 degrees C-2 for some grid boxes in the earlier period) over mountain
   and coastal areas. In the period of 1895-2008, every month from January
   to December has a positive linear trend. February has the largest trend
   of 0.162 degrees C (10 yr)(-1), and September has the smallest trend at
   0.020 degrees C (10 yr)(-1). The three hottest (coldest) years measured
   by the mean SAT over the United States were ranked as 1998, 2006, and
   1934 (1917, 1895, and 1912).},

Title = {Study on long term troposphere lower stratosphere temperature (TLST)
   trend in tropical and subtropical northern hemisphere using ground based
   and COSMIC satellite data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The troposphere, the lowest and closest layer of the atmosphere, is
   where all meteorological events take place. The tropospheric - lower
   stratospheric (TLS) temperature trend is determined using linear
   regression and is essential to comprehending the consequences of climate
   change in the future. In this article, we explored the long-term
   temperature variabilities and trends of TLS (1-25 km) temperature and
   its responses by natural drivers such as El Nino southern oscillation
   (ENSO), solar flux (SF), quasi-biannual oscillation (QBO), Indian ocean
   dipole (IOD), and aerosol indexes (AI) using monthly averaged zonal mean
   COSMIC satellite and ground - based Radiosonde (RS) observations for the
   period of 2006 - 2020 over tropical station Addis ( 9 0 N, 38 . 8 0 E)
   and subtropical station Cairo ( 30 . 03 0 N, 31 . 23 0 E). The
   tropopause is located at the tropical station Addis at 17 km with a
   temperature of 190-194 K, and for the subtropical station Cairo, it is
   located at 15 km with a temperature of 201 K, which supports the
   decrement of tropopause height from the tropics to the subtropics with a
   slight increase in temperature. The two main oscillations in the TLS
   region can be seen by using the wavelet analysis technique: the
   semiannual oscillation (SAO) and the annual oscillation (AO), with the
   AO being especially strong in the lower troposphere. Furthermore, Morlet
   wavelet analysis on cold-point tropopause temperature CPTt displays AO
   and cold point tropopause height CPTh reveals a QBO-like signal. The TLS
   region has positive peaks at heights of 7, 21, 22, 13, and 4 km for the
   Addis station, and at 15, 19, 25, 15, and 16 km for the Cairo station in
   response to natural drivers such as ENSO, SF, QBO, IOD, and aerosol. Lag
   analyses demonstrate a one-month delay for all natural forcings, except
   for oceanic indices and SSF, up to three months below the tropopause
   (below 15 km). There is a noticeable 3 to 4 months lag in every
   oscillation above the tropopause. A warming trend in the tropospheric
   region and a cooling trend in the UTLS regions are revealed by MLR trend
   analysis. In contrast to the subtropical Cairo station, which has the
   highest warming rate of 0.38 K/decade at 2 km and the maximum cooling
   rate of -0.2 K/decade at 10 km, the tropical Addis station has the
   highest cooling rate of -0.38 K/decade at 12 km and the highest warming
   rate of 0.28 K/decade at 3 km. Our trend findings are consistent with
   previous research.},

   patterns and biology of ocean quahogs ill the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB)

   mouth) population encompassing a broad size (age) range of animals that
   had not yet recruited to the commercial fishery {[}<80 mill shell length

   described using a power function. Quahog age did not vary significantly

   length with depth or region significant. An age-length key was developed
   for ocean quahogs to generate age frequencies for each station.

Title = {Where the people are: Current trends and future potential targeted
   investments in urban trees for PM<sub>10</sub> and temperature
   mitigation in 27 US Cities},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {177},

Abstract = {Urban trees reduce respirable particulate matter (PM10) concentrations
   and maximum daytime summer temperatures. While most cities are losing
   tree cover, some are considering ambitious planting efforts. Maximizing
   PM10 and heat mitigation for people from such efforts requires
   cost-effective targeting. We adapt published methods to estimate the
   impact of a decade (2004-2014) of tree cover change on city-level PM10
   and heat mitigation in 27 U.S. cities and present a new methodology for
   estimating local-level PM10 and heat mitigation by street trees and tree
   patches. We map potential tree planting sites in the 27 cities and use
   our local-level PM10 and heat mitigation methods to assess the
   population-weighted return on investment (ROI) of each site for PM10 and
   heat abatement for nearby populations. Twenty-three of the 27 cities
   lost canopy cover during 2004-2014, reducing estimated city-level PMic,
   removal by 6\% (168 tons) and increasing city-level average maximum
   daily summer temperature by 0.1 degrees C on average across cities. We
   find large potential for urban reforestation to increase PM10 and heat
   abatement. Infra-city variation in planting site ROI - driven primarily
   by differences in population density around planting sites - exceeds
   four orders of magnitude, indicating large scope for targeting to
   increase PM10 and heat abatement from reforestation. Reforesting each
   city's top 20\% ROI sites could lower average annual PMic,
   concentrations by > 2 mu g/m(3) for 3.4-11.4 million people and average
   maximum daily summer temperatures by > 2 degrees C for 1.7-12.7 million
   - effects large enough to provide meaningful health benefits - at a
   combined annual cost of \$102 million.},

Abstract = {Statistical analysis was applied to series of weekly temperatures
   measured by meteorological rockets at heights of 25-75 km over the Heiss
   Island (80.6degrees N), Volgograd (48.7degrees N), Thumba (8.5degrees
   N), and Molodezhnaya (67.7degrees S) stations during 1969-1995. A linear
   approximation of a time series for each month, with the long-period
   component filtered out, was used to construct vertical profiles of
   temperature and to estimate variations in the stratopause height and
   temperature during the entire period of rocket measurements. A
   statistically significant decrease (with 95\% confidence) was
   established in the stratopause height. Specifically, the stratopause
   height was found to decrease by 0.4 km over Heiss Island, by 0.5 km over
   Thumba, and especially strongly (by 2.4 km) over Volgograd. Over the
   Molodezhnaya station, the annual mean stratopause height did not vary. A
   decrease in the stratopause height from the data measured at Volgograd
   and Thumba was found to occur in all seasons, except for the spring
   months. The maximum decrease in the stratopause height at 5-7 km was
   observed over Volgograd in winter. The stratopause height over Heiss
   Island decreased only in January (2.4 km), February (4.5 km), and
   insignificantly in March (1.0 km). The stratopause temperature decreased
   statistically significantly over Heiss Island (by 4.9 K), Volgograd (by
   2.8 K), and Thumba (by 4.0 K) and increased by 1.0 K (statistically
   insignificantly with 95\% confidence) over the Molodezhnaya station. The
   changes in the stratopause temperature agree with previously published
   values of annual mean trends in the height range 4550 km. Estimates of
   monthly mean variations in the stratopause temperature are presented.
   The assumption is discussed that ozone depletion in the mesosphere
   during the last decades is the main cause for the observed decrease in
   the stratopause height.},

Abstract = {This work analyzes the frequency of days characterized by daytime
   temperature inversion and air stagnation events in the Po valley area.
   The analysis is focused on both historical series and future projections
   under climate change. Historical sounding data from two different
   Italian stations are used as well as future projections data, provided
   by CMCC-CCLM 4-8-19 regional climate model (MED-CORDEX initiative). A
   new method to detect layers of temperature inversion is also presented.
   The developed method computes the occurrence of a temperature inversion
   layer for a given day at 12 UTC without a detailed knowledge of
   temperature vertical profile. This method was validated using sounding
   data and applied to the model projections, under two different emissions
   scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Under RCP4.5 intermediate emissions
   scenario, the occurrence of temperature inversions is projected to
   increase by 12 days/year (around + 10\%) in the last decade of 21st
   century compared to 1986-2005 average. However, the increase in
   temperature inversions seems to be especially concentrated in the warm
   period. Under RCP8.5 extreme scenario, temperature inversions are still
   projected to increase, though to a lesser extent compared to RCP4.5
   scenario (+ 6 days/year in the last decade of 21st century). A similar
   trend was found also for air stagnation events, which take into account
   the variation of precipitation pattern and wind strength. The expected
   increases are equal to +13 days/year and +11 days/year in the last
   decade of 21st century compared to 1986-2005 average, under RCP4.5 and
   RCP8.5 scenarios respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Within-population variation in phenology of boreal trees indicates their
   adaptability to climatic variations. Although interannual variations in
   date of bud burst have been widely discussed, little is known about
   within-population variation, the key determinants for this variation and
   the effects of this variation on estimates of trends in bud burst date.
   Over a period of nine years, we monitored timing of bud burst daily in
   30 mature white birch (Betula pendula Roth) trees in a naturally
   regenerated stand. Our results revealed not only large interannual
   variation but also considerable intraannual variation among individual
   trees in date of bud burst, the maximum within-population variation
   being four weeks. Bud burst can be accurately predicted by the date when
   a threshold value of temperature sum in spring is reached (base
   temperature +5 degrees C). Based on this temperature sum and past
   temperature records, we estimated the trend in date of bud burst. The
   linear trend estimate based on the years 1926-2005 is an advancement of
   1.2 days per decade (95\% confidence interval, +/- 0.7 days), which is
   much less than that predicted by time series based on coarser time
   intervals. We conclude that, because of large interannual differences,
   and large annual within-population variations in bud burst, estimates of
   bud burst date based on measurements made over a period of only a few
   decades are unreliable.},

Title = {Non-linear trends and fluctuations in temperature during different
   growth stages of summer maize in the North China Plain from 1960 to 2014},

Abstract = {North China Plain has undergone severe warming trends since the 1950s,
   but whether this trend is the same during different growth phases for
   crops remains unknown. Thus, we analyzed the non-linear changes in the
   minimum temperature (T-min), mean temperature (T-mean) and maximum
   temperature (T-max) using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition
   method during each growth stage of summer maize based on daily
   temperature data from 1960 to 2014. Our results strongly suggest that
   the trends and fluctuations in temperature change are non-linear. These
   changes can be categorized into four types of trend change according to
   the combinations of decreasing and increasing trends, and 8 fluctuation
   modes dominated by the fluctuations of expansion and shrinkage. The
   amplitude of the fluctuation is primarily expansion in the
   sowing-jointing stage and shrinkage in the jointing-maturity stage.
   Moreover, the temperature changes are inconsistent within each growth
   stage and are not consistent with the overall warming trend observed
   over the last 55 years. A transition period occurred in both the 1980s
   and the 1990s for temperatures during the sowing-tasseling stage.
   Furthermore, the cooling trend of the T-max was significant in the
   sowing emergence stage, while this cooling trend was not obvious for
   both T-mean and T-min in the jointing-tasseling stage. These results
   showed that temperature change was significantly different in different
   stages of the maize growth season. The results can serve as a scientific
   basis for a better understanding of the actual changes in the regional
   surface air temperature and agronomic heat resources.},

Title = {Temperature and pressure variations of d-d luminescence band maxima of
   bis(pyridylalkenolato)- palladium(II) complexes with different ligand
   substituents: opposite-signed trends},

Abstract = {Luminescence spectra of two d(8)-configured bis(pyridylalkenolato)
   palladium(II) complexes, {[}Pd\{PyCHC-(C3F7)O\}(2)] and
   {[}Pd\{PyCHC(CH3)O\}(2)], are presented at variable temperature and
   pressure. Bands are assigned as d-d transitions. The heptafluoropropyl
   and methyl substituents on the ligands have different steric demands,
   influencing luminescence spectra. Broad bands with maxima at
   approximately 12 700 cm(-1) (790 nm) for ligands with heptafluoropropyl
   substituents and 12 100 cm(-1) (830 nm) for ligands with methyl
   substituents and widths of approximately 2100 cm(-1) for both complexes
   are observed at 80 K. Quenching of the luminescence is observed as
   temperature increases. The maxima of {[}Pd\{PyCHC(C3F7)O\}(2)] show a
   shift of -0.9 +/- 0.1 cm(-1) K-1 due to broadening of the spectra to
   lower energy. The luminescence maxima of {[}Pd\{PyCHC(CH3)O\}(2)] shift
   in the opposite direction by + 7.2 +/- 0.7 cm(-1) K-1. Shifts with
   different signs are also obtained from variable-pressure luminescence
   spectra, with values of + 13 +/- 2 cm(-1) kbar(-1) and -15 +/- 7 cm(-1)
   kbar(-1) for {[}Pd\{PyCHC(C3F7)O\}(2)] and {[}Pd\{PyCHC(CH3)O\}(2)],
   respectively. The pressure-induced decrease is unusual and likely caused
   by intermolecular interactions involving the palladium(II) center and a
   vinylic proton of a neighboring complex.},

Title = {Assessing the internal variability in multi-decadal trends of summer

Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of internal variability on East Asian
   summer (June-July-August) surface air temperature (SAT) trends on the
   multidecadal time scale based on a 30-member ensemble of simulations
   that share the same external forcing from 1970 to 2005. The
   ensemble-mean SAT in East Asia shows a positive trend, but the patterns
   and the magnitudes in the individual members are remarkably diverse,
   highlighting the strong effect of internal variability. The first two
   leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of the SAT trends
   among ensemble members are used to represent the leading patterns of
   internally generated SAT change in East Asia. The first EOF mode
   displays a south-north dipole structure, associated with a zonally
   banded circulation pattern over East Asia and the North Pacific. The
   second mode represents coherent trend in North China, Korea and Japan,
   accompanied by the Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM)-like
   circulation changes. A dynamical adjustment method is applied to reduce
   circulation-induced internal variability in SAT, and the adjusted SAT
   trends are much less variable among ensemble members and more in line
   with the ensemble mean than the raw trends. Observed evidences show that
   the summertime SAT in most of East Asia, especially in northern East
   Asia, has experienced rapid warming in recent decades. After dynamical
   adjustment, the residual trends of SAT in observations are weaker than
   the raw trends, especially at high and middle latitudes, suggesting the
   enhanced warming in northern East Asia over the recent decades was not
   entirely anthropogenic but partly caused by internal variability.},

Title = {Exploring the Variation Trend of Urban Expansion, Land Surface
   Temperature, and Ecological Quality and Their Interrelationships in
   Guangzhou, China, from 1987 to 2019},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {This study explored the model of urban impervious surface (IS) density,
   land surface temperature (LST), and comprehensive ecological evaluation
   index (CEEI) from urban centers to suburbs. The interrelationships
   between these parameters in Guangzhou from 1987 to 2019 were analyzed
   using time-series Landsat-5 TM (Thematic Mapper), Landsat-8 OLI
   (Operational Land Imager), and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) images.
   The urban IS densities were calculated in concentric rings using
   time-series IS fractions, which were used to construct an inverse
   S-shaped urban IS density function to depict changes in urban form and
   the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban expansion from the urban center to
   the suburbs. The results indicated that Guangzhou experienced expansive
   urban growth, with the patterns of urban spatial structure changing from
   a single-center to a multi-center structure over the past 32 years.
   Next, the normalized LST and CEEI in each concentric ring were
   calculated, and their variation trends from the urban center to the
   suburbs were modeled using linear and nonlinear functions, respectively.
   The results showed that the normalized LST had a gradual decreasing
   trend from the urban center to the suburbs, while the CEEI showed a
   significant increasing trend. During the 32-year rapid urban
   development, the normalized LST difference between the urban center and
   suburbs increased gradually with time, and the CEEI significantly
   decreased. This indicated that rapid urbanization significantly expanded
   the impervious surface areas in Guangzhou, leading to an increase in the
   LST difference between urban centers and suburbs and a deterioration in
   ecological quality. Finally, the potential interrelationships among
   urban IS density, normalized LST, and CEEI were also explored using
   different models. This study revealed that rapid urbanization has
   produced geographical convergence between several ISs, which may
   increase the risk of the urban heat island effect and degradation of
   ecological quality.},

Abstract = {The ocean warming trend is a well-known global phenomenon. As early as
   2001, and then reiterated in 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the global average sea surface
   temperature (SST) will increase by about 0.2 degrees C per decade. To
   date, however, only a limited number of studies have been published
   reporting the spatio-temporal trends in SST in the Indo-Pacific region,
   one the richest marine ecosystems on Earth. In this research, the
   monthly 1 degrees spatial resolution NOAA Optimum Interpolation (01) sea
   surface temperature (SST) V2 dataset (OISSTv2) derived from measurements
   made by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and in situ
   measurements, were used to examine the spatio-temporal trends in SST in
   the region. The multi-model mean SST from the Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6) mitigation scenario of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) was also used to forecast future
   SST from 2020 to 2100, decadally. Three variables from the OISSTv2,
   namely maximum (MaxSST), mean (MeanSST) and minimum (MinSST) monthly
   mean SST, were regressed against time measured in months from 1982 to
   2010 using linear regression. Results revealed warming trends detected
   for all three SST variables. In the Coral Triangle a warming trend with
   a rate of 0.013 degrees C year(-1), 0.017 degrees C year(-1), and 0.019
   degrees C year(-1) was detected over 29 years for MaxSST, MeanSST and
   MinSST, respectively. In the SCS, the warming rate was 0.011 degrees C
   year(-1), (MaxSST), 0.012 degrees C year-1 (MeanSST) and 0.015 degrees C
   year(-1) (MinSST) over 29 years. The CMIP5 RCP2.6 forecast suggested a
   future warming rate to 2100 of 0.004 degrees C year(-1) for both areas,
   and for all three SST variables. The warming trends reported in this
   study provide useful insights for improved marine-related management.

Abstract = {With the continuous development of digital display technology, display
   methods have also changed. Pepper's ghost images that adopt modern
   display methods require the light environment of the ex-hibition space
   not only to ensure the effect but also ensure better visual comfort. In
   order to explore the influ-ence of the lighting environment on the
   display effect based on Pepper's ghost images, a virtual imaging display
   space is set up to analyze the factors and trends affecting the imaging
   effect, in which 12 sets of LED lighting conditions with different
   illuminances and color temperatures are generated. 25 observers are
   selec-ted to conduct a psychophysical experiment. The experiment shows
   that color temperature has no significant effect on the evaluation of
   color authenticity, detail expressiveness and stereoscopic
   expressiveness for Pep-per's ghost images; illumination has no strong
   effect on the evaluation of the color authenticity of Pepper's ghost
   images, but has a significant effect on their detail expressiveness and
   stereoscopic expressiveness. Un-der the lighting environment where the
   color temperature is 3 500 K and the illumination is 10 lx, the
   de-tailed expressiveness and stereoscopic expressiveness of the display
   effect are relatively high and the visual comfort of 2 500 K and 10 lx
   is better.},

Title = {Estimation of evapotranspiration using all-weather land surface
   temperature and variational trends with warming temperatures for the
   River Source Region in Southwest China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite thermal infrared
   (TIR) remote sensing is widely used in estimating land surface
   evapotranspiration (ET) through energy balance theory. However, as
   satellite TIR remote sensing is frequently affected by clouds, the
   derived LST with spatial missing makes it impossible to estimate
   seamless ET for large areas. In this study, based on the all-weather LST
   (AWLST) generated through the synergistic use of TIR and passive
   microwave (PMW) remote sensing, we propose an estimation scheme of
   all-weather ET (AWET) for the River Source Region of Southwest China
   (RSR-SC) with complex environmental characteristics of frequent clouds
   and fog. Specifically, the parameters of the Surface Energy Balance
   System (SEBS), which have high impact on the model results, are first
   accurately determined by a global sensitivity analysis. Second, the
   parametric calculation schemes of turbulent exchange, such as surface
   roughness heights for momentum (z(0m)) and heat (z(0h)) transfer, and
   soil heat flux (G(0)) of the SEBS model are refined. Third, the daily ET
   temporal upscaling method is developed. Then a long-term AWET product
   for the RSR-SC is generated. Comparison against ground measurements from
   12 eddy covariance (EC) sites indicates a good accuracy of the AWET
   product: the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) and root mean square
   error (RMSE) of the daily ET estimates are 36 \% and 0.88 mm/d,
   respectively. From aspects of temporal variation of daily ET, monthly
   spatiotemporal distribution patterns, interannual variation of different
   land covers and spatial distribution comparison with other ET products,
   the generated AWET exhibits to be realistic, reflecting relatively
   subtle variations. Further investigation indicates that the response of
   surface ET to the warming temperatures exhibits the spatial
   heterogeneity of the change trend. This study highlights the importance
   of estimating daily AWET at a MODIS-like scale using AWLST data to
   significantly benefit water resource monitoring and conduct runoff
   prediction over large areas and watershed scales.},

Abstract = {The Yangtze River Delta (YRD), including Shanghai City, Jiangsu and
   Zhejiang Provinces, is the largest metropolitan region in China. In the
   past decades, the region has experienced massive urbanization and
   detrimentally affected the environment in the region. Identifying the
   spatio-temporal variations of climate change and its influencing
   mechanism in the YRD is an important task for assessing their impacts on
   the local society and ecosystem. Based on long-term (1958-2014)
   observation data of meteorological stations, three temperature indices,
   i.e. extreme maximum temperature (TXx), extreme minimum temperature
   (TNn), and mean temperature (TMm), were selected and spatialized with
   climatological calculations and spatial techniques. Evolution and
   spatial heterogeneity of three temperature indices over YRD as well as
   their links to atmospheric circulation and anthropogenic activity were
   investigated. In the whole YRD, a statistically significant overall
   uptrend could be detected in three temperature indices with the
   Mann-Kendall (M-K) trend test method. The linear increasing trend for
   TMm was 0.31 degrees C/10 a, which was higher than the global average
   (0.12 degrees C/10 a during 1951-2012). For TXx and TNn, the increasing
   rates were 0.41 degrees C/10 a and 0.52 degrees C/10 a. Partial
   correlation analysis indicated that TMm was more related with TXx (r(p)
   = 0.68, p < 0.001) than TNn (r(p) = 0.48, p < 0.001). Furthermore, it
   was detected with M-K analysis at pixel scale that 62.17\%, 96.75\% and
   97.05\% of the areas in the YRD showed significant increasing trends for
   TXx, TNn and TMm, respectively. The increasing trend was more obvious in
   the southern mountainous areas than the northern plains areas. Further
   analysis indicated that the variation of TXx over YRD was mainly
   influenced by anthropogenic activities (e.g. economic development),
   while TNn was more affected by atmospheric circulations (e.g., the
   Eurasian zonal circulation index (EAZ) and the cold air activity index
   (CA)). For TMm, it was a result of comprehensive effects of both
   atmospheric circulations and anthropogenic activities. On the whole, the
   northern plain areas was mainly dominated by atmospheric circulations,
   while the southern mountain areas of YRD was more affected by
   anthropogenic activities. The findings of this study might help to build
   a better understanding of the mechanics of temperature variations, and
   assess the potentially influencing factors on temperature changes.},

Title = {Seasonal variability in temperature trends and atmospheric circulation
   systems during the Eemian (Last Interglacial) based on <i>n</i>-alkanes
   hydrogen isotopes from Northern Finland},
Journal = {QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {273},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The Last Interglacial warm period, the Eemian (ca. 130-116 thousand
   years ago), serves as a reference for projected future climate in a
   warmer world. However, there is a limited understanding of the seasonal
   characteristics of interglacial climate dynamics, especially in high
   latitude regions. In this study, we aim to provide new insights into
   seasonal trends in temperature and moisture source location, linked to
   shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns, for northern Fennoscandia
   during the Eemian. Our study is based on the distribution and stable
   hydrogen isotope composition (delta D) of n-alkanes in a lake sediment
   sequence from the Sokli paleolake in NE Finland, placed in a multi-proxy
   framework. The delta D values of predominantly macrophyte-derived
   mid-chain n-alkanes are interpreted to reflect lake water delta D
   variability influenced by winter precipitation delta D (delta Dprec),
   ice cover duration and deuterium (D)-depleted meltwater. The delta D
   values of terrestrial plant-derived long-chain n-alkanes primarily
   reflect soil water delta D variability modulated by summer delta Dprec
   and by the evaporative enrichment of soil and leaf water. The delta
   Dprec variability in our study area is mostly attributed to the
   temperature effect and the moisture source location linked to the
   relative dominance between D-depleted continental and polar air masses
   and D-enriched North Atlantic air masses. The biomarker signal further
   corroborates earlier diatom-based studies and pollen-inferred January
   and July temperature reconstructions from the same sediment sequence.
   Three phases of climatic changes can be identified that generally follow
   the secular variations in seasonal insolation: (i) an early warming
   trend succeeded by a period of strong seasonality (ii) a mid-optimum
   phase with gradually decreased seasonality and cooler summers, and (iii)
   a late climatic instability with a cooling trend. Superimposed on this
   trend, two abrupt cooling events occur in the early and late Eemian. The
   Sokli delta D variability is generally in good agreement with other
   North Atlantic and Siberian records, reflecting major changes in the
   atmospheric circulation patterns during the Eemian as a response to
   orbital and oceanic forcings. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Contribution of external forcings to the observed trend in surface
   temperature over Africa during 1901-2014 and its future projection from
   CMIP6 simulations},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {254},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Previous studies revealed that many areas in Africa experienced an
   apparent warming rate in surface temperature in the last century.
   However, the contributing factors have not been investigated in details.
   In the present study, natural and anthropogenic forcings accountable for
   surface temperature variability and change are examined from the
   historical Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase six (CMIP6)
   simulations and future projections under three Shared Socioeconomic
   Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2.4.5 and SSP5-8.5), which represent low,
   moderate and high emission scenarios, respectively. Results indicate
   that from 1901 to 2014, surface temperature has increased by similar to
   0.07 degrees C/decade over both Eastern Africa (EAF) and Sahara (SAH)
   regions, 0.06 degrees C/decade in Southern Africa (SAF) and Western
   Africa (WAF) regions and follows the global warming trend. It is found
   that Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and Land-Use (LU) change are the leading
   contributors to the observed warming in historical surface temperature
   over Africa. Anthropogenic Aerosols (AA) show a cooling effect on
   surface temperature. Under both SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 emission
   scenarios, the surface temperature increases to 2059 and declines
   afterwards. On the other hand, under SSP5-8.5, the surface temperature
   is expected to increase throughout the 21st century. The impacts of
   warming will be hard-felt in SAH and SAF regions compared to other
   areas. The analysis of rare hot and cold events (2080-2099) based on the
   20-year annual highest and lowest daily surface temperature relative to
   the recent past (1995-2014) under SSP2-4.5 indicates that both events
   are likely to increase significantly in the later 21st century.
   Nevertheless, proper management of Land use and control of anthropogenic
   factors (GHGs and AA) may lead to a substantial reduction in further
   warming over Africa.},

Title = {First Analyses of the TIMELINE AVHRR SST Product: Long-Term Trends of
   Sea Surface Temperature at 1 km Resolution across European Coastal Zones},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Coastal areas are among the most productive areas in the world,
   ecologically as well as economically. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) has
   evolved as the major essential climate variable (ECV) and ocean variable
   (EOV) to monitor land-ocean interactions and oceanic warming trends. SST
   monitoring can be achieved by means of remote sensing. The current
   relatively coarse spatial resolution of established SST products limits
   their potential in small-scale, coastal zones. This study presents the
   first analysis of the TIMELINE 1 km SST product from AVHRR in four key
   European regions: The Northern and Baltic Sea, the Adriatic Sea, the
   Aegean Sea, and the Balearic Sea. The analysis of monthly anomaly trends
   showed high positive SST trends in all study areas, exceeding the global
   average SST warming. Seasonal variations reveal peak warming during the
   spring, early summer, and early autumn, suggesting a potential seasonal
   shift. The spatial analysis of the monthly anomaly trends revealed
   significantly higher trends at near-coast areas, which were especially
   distinct in the Mediterranean study areas. The clearest pattern was
   visible in the Adriatic Sea in March and May, where the SST trends at
   the coast were twice as high as that observed at a 40 km distance to the
   coast. To validate our findings, we compared the TIMELINE monthly
   anomaly time series with monthly anomalies derived from the Level 4 CCI
   SST anomaly product. The comparison showed an overall good accordance
   with correlation coefficients of R > 0.82 for the Mediterranean study
   areas and R = 0.77 for the North and Baltic Seas. This study highlights
   the potential of AVHRR Local Area Coverage (LAC) data with 1 km spatial
   resolution for mapping long-term SST trends in areas with high spatial
   SST variability, such as coastal regions.},

Abstract = {Climate change is an event that has significant effects as direct or
   indirect on ecosystem and living things. In order to be prepared for the
   effect of climate change, it is necessary to anticipate these changes
   and take measures for this change. Therefore, many studies have been
   carried out on changes in climate parameters in recent years. The most
   common method used in these studies is trend methods. Innovative Polygon
   Trend Analysis (IPTA) and Trend Polygon Star Concept are trend analysis
   methods. IPTA Method divides data series into two as first and second
   data set and analyzes these two data sets by comparing them with each
   other. Trend Polygon Star Concept analyzes distance between two months
   in data set in graph, which is result of IPTA, and shows analysis result
   by dividing it into four regions. Therefore, in this study, monthly
   average temperature data are analyzed by using this two-polygon method.
   This data set is for 22 years (1996-2017). Polygon graphics were created
   as a result of study. Besides, trend slopes and lengths of temperature
   data with IPTA Method were calculated. The values of graphs created with
   Trend Polygon Star Concept Method on x- and y-axis were given in a
   table. When the results of both analysis methods were examined for a
   station, the following results were observed. For example, a regular
   polygon was not seen in arithmetic mean and standard deviation graphs of
   IPTA Method of Bandirma Station. Besides, when general evaluation of
   arithmetic mean analysis results was examined an increasing trend in
   most months. When arithmetic average graph created by Trend Polygon Star
   Concept Method of Bandirma Station was examined, transition between two
   months was seen first and third region. When standard deviation graph
   was examined, transitions between two months were seen in all four
   regions.},

Title = {Seasonally changing contribution of sea ice and snow cover to

Volume = {57},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of sea ice and snow changes on
   surface air temperature (SAT) trends on the multidecadal time scale over
   the mid- and high-latitudes of Eurasia during boreal autumn, winter and
   spring based on a 30-member ensemble simulations of the Community Earth
   System Model (CESM). A dynamical adjustment method is used to remove the
   internal component of circulation-induced SAT trends. The leading mode
   of dynamically adjusted SAT trends is featured by same-sign anomalies
   extending from northern Europe to central Siberia and to the Russian Far
   East, respectively, during boreal spring and autumn, and confined to
   western Siberia during winter. The internally generated component of sea
   ice concentration trends over the Barents-Kara Seas contributes to the
   differences in the thermodynamic component of internal SAT trends across
   the ensemble over adjacent northern Siberia during all the three
   seasons. The sea ice effect is largest in autumn and smallest in winter.
   Eurasian snow changes contribute to the spread in dynamically adjusted
   SAT trends as well around the periphery of snow covered region by
   modulating surface heat flux changes. The snow effect is identified over
   northeast Europe-western Siberia in autumn, north of the Caspian Sea in
   winter, and over eastern Europe-northern Siberia in spring. The effects
   of sea ice and snow on the SAT trends are realized mainly by modulating
   upward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes.},

Abstract = {Although beech (Fagus) pollen are often disregarded, they play an
   allergological role. This study focused on pollen season (PS) of
   European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and mean yearly temperatures (T) at
   two climatically different sites (lowlands vs. Alps) in Germany. Pollen
   sampling was conducted with 7-day recording volumetric spore traps
   between 1982 and 2014. Both PS parameters (start, peak, length, annual
   pollen index {[}PI]) and T were compared in two periods (1982-1991 and
   1992-2014), and correlations between PS and T were analysed. At both
   sites, average PS occurred earlier in the second period. Statistically
   significant differences were proved at the alpine site in terms of start
   and peak of the season, and PI. On average, PS in the lowlands was
   shorter and occurred earlier than in the Alps. As is the case with a lot
   of temperate tree species, beeches show the masting phenomenon and PI
   differed greatly among the years. Mast years were much less frequent
   than non-mast years, and the differences between the pollen sums were
   significant. Average pollen counts at the alpine site were about three
   times higher than in the lowlands. At both sites, higher T was
   significantly correlated with an earlier start and peak of the season,
   and an increased PI. Trends of T over the years were significantly
   positive. Temperature increase as a part of climate change may
   contribute to an earlier occurrence of the flowering season of European
   beech and to higher airborne pollen concentrations.},

Abstract = {This study shows that the total hemispheric cold air mass (CAM) amount
   below a designated potential temperature of 280K serves as a good
   indicator of long-term climate change trends in the polar region. We
   conduct quantitative analyses of the warming trends of Northern
   Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) winters using five
   reanalysis data sets (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, ERA-Interim,
   Japanese 55year Reanalysis Japanese 25 year Reanalysis, JRA-25, and
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for
   Atmospheric Research) and JRA-55-related data sets (JRA-55 Conventional
   reanalysis and JRA-55 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project type
   simulation). Total hemispheric CAM amount for the NH winter shows a
   significant decreasing trend for most of the reanalyses at a rate of
   approximately -1.37 to -0.77\%decade(-1) from 1959 to 2012 and at a rate
   of approximately -1.57 to -0.84\%decade(-1) from 1980 to 2012. The CAM
   amount trends show very different geographic patterns during the two
   periods, which suggests that geographical patterns of the trends
   estimated for these periods are largely controlled by internal
   low-frequency dynamics. The CAM flux across 45 degrees N, which serves
   as an indicator of hemispheric scale cold air outbreaks, has so large
   interannual variability that its trend becomes insignificant. In the SH
   winter, trends of total hemispheric CAM amount and its equatorward flux
   across 50 degrees S are not consistent among the new reanalyses for
   1980-2012. Although total hemispheric CAM amount decreases for
   1959-2012, sparse observations and changes in systematic bias, due to
   the implementation of assimilation of satellite observation data in
   1979, compromise the reliability of the trends. Improvements to the
   reanalyses are desirable as a means of monitoring historical changes in
   CAM for the SH winter.},

Abstract = {The mechanisms of maintenance of earth hummocks and non-sorted stripes
   in seasonally frozen ground on the Old Man Range, Otago, New Zealand
   were investigated. These landforms are hypothesised to be active
   periglacial landforms maintained by seasonal movement of moisture down
   an energy gradient. We tested three hypotheses: 1) freezing should occur
   predominantly in the crests of the stripes and hummocks; 2) differential
   freezing patterns should be consistent between years; and 3) in the
   presence of a temperature gradient (i.e. in winter), soil moisture
   content should be greater in crests than in furrows. An array of 39
   thermistors at each of two sites was used to monitor soil temperature
   gradients during three winters, and replicate soil cores were taken in
   autumn and winter to determine soil moisture gradients. Freezing
   occurred mainly in the crests and sides (heavily influenced by aspect),
   and patterns of freezing showed strong interannual consistency,
   supporting our first two hypotheses. Soil in crests had a higher
   moisture content in both freezing and thawed seasons, which was
   inconclusive relative to the expected water gradient. Copyright (C) 2008

Year = {2008},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {The seasonal changes of leaf physiological traits and its relationship
   with abiotic factors (photosynthetic active radiation-PAR. leaf
   temperature-T-leaf, air temperature-T-air, T-leaf -T-air- Delta T) were
   studied on sugar beets grown under the semi-and conditions of central
   Greece. Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cv Rizor was established in a
   Randomised Complete Block design experiment for two years (2004-2005).
   From early June till the end of October, 11 determinations of leaf
   physiological traits (intracellular to ambient CO2 concentration-c(1),
   transpiration rare-E, stomatal conductance-g, net photosynthesis-A,
   instantaneous water use efficiency-A/E, photosynthetic water use
   efficiency-A/g(s), chlorophyll content-SPAD, carbon isotope
   discrimination- Delta, N concentration and specific leaf area-SLA) took
   place. Temperatures (T-leaf and T-air) and Delta T were higher in 2004
   when water budget (WB, precipitation - irrigation - evapotranspiration)
   was more negative, Also, seasonal mean of carbort isotope discrimination
   (A) and net photosynthesis (A) were lower in 2004 to compare to 2005. A
   gradual decline with the progress of the growing season was found for A,
   Delta, g(s), E, SLA arid leaf N concentration while the adverse trend
   was evident for water use efficiencies (WUE, A/E arid A/g(s). PAR was
   positively related with g, and E and negatively with A/E. Temperatures
   (T-air and T-leaf) had a positive effect on E and a negative one on A/E.
   High temperatures (35-37 degrees C) degraded leaf chlorophyll but
   temperatures higher than 37 degrees C tended to increase chlorophyll
   content. AT (transpirational cooling) was negatively related with g, E,
   arid A and positively with A/E and A/g(s), Both E and A were regulated
   by g(s) which was kept higher or slightly lower than 0.10 mol m(-2)
   s(-1), limit indicative of severe drought ill C-3 Species. Positive
   relationships were found between A, leaf N concentration and SLA. SLA is
   an indicator of resource-use strategy arid can provide useful
   information about abiotic factor effects on sugar beet physiology and
   yield. A was negatively related with A/g(s) showing that it can be an
   indirect assessment of WUE at leaf level.},

   NO<sub>2</sub> trend over the US},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {EPA reports a steady decline of US anthropogenic NO (x) emissions in
   2005-2019 summers, while NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the
   OMI satellite over large spatial domains have flattened since 2009. To
   better understand the contributing factors to a flattening of the OMI
   NO2 trends, we investigate the role of soil and lightning NOx emissions
   on this apparent disagreement. We improve soil NO (x) emissions
   estimates using a new observation-based temperature response, which
   increases the linear correlation coefficient between GEOS-Chem simulated
   and OMI NO2 VCDs by 0.05-0.2 over the Central US. Multivariate trend
   analysis reveals that soil and lightning NO (x) combined emissions
   trends change from -3.95\% a(-1) during 2005-2009 to 0.60\% a(-1) from
   2009 to 2019, thereby rendering the abrupt slowdown of total NO (x)
   emissions reduction. Non-linear inter-annual variations explain 6.6\% of
   the variance of total NO (x) emissions. As background emissions become
   relatively larger with uncertain inter-annual variations, the NO2 VCDs
   alone at the national scale, especially in the regions with vast rural
   areas, will be insufficient to discern the trend of anthropogenic
   emissions.},

Title = {Variability and trends of mean maximum and mean minimum air temperature

   gridded data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},

Pages = {6177-6192},
Abstract = {In this study, the variability and trends of the mean annual and
   seasonal maximum and minimum surface air temperature in Greece are
   examined, using monthly data sets of 26 meteorological stations from the
   Hellenic National Meteorological Service (HNMS) and gridded data from
   the National Center for Environmental Prediction-National Center for
   Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) Reanalysis project for the period
   1955-2001. NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data sets are created by assimilating
   climate observations from different sources, including ships,
   satellites, ground stations, radiosonde observations and radar. The
   general purpose of conducting reanalyses is to produce multi-year global
   state-of-the-art gridded representations of atmospheric states,
   generated by a constant model and a constant data-assimilation system.
   The trends of the mean extreme air temperatures were evaluated, using
   the Mann-Kendall criterion, and, in the process, factor analysis was
   applied to both the stations' and the NCEP-NCAR grid points time series.
   Regarding the mean maximum air temperature, the first main factor, which
   explains a high percentage of the total variance, presents a
   statistically significant (CL = 95\%) negative trend only during the
   winter. The first main factor of the mean minimum air temperature
   manifests a statistically significant (CL = 95\%) positive trend during
   the summer and the year, and a statistically significant (CL = 95\%)
   negative trend in autumn and winter. These findings were compared to the
   respective ones of the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data and significant
   differences in the spatial distribution and temporal variability of the
   extracted new factors were found. These differences between the two
   examined data sets could be attributed to topographical factors such
   orography and land-sea distribution, which could not be represented
   properly by the reanalysis model.},

Abstract = {Drought is among the costliest natural disasters on both ecosystems and
   agroeconomics in China. However, most previous studies have used coarse
   resolution data or simply stopped short of investigating drought
   projection and its impact on crop yield. Motivated by the newly released
   higher-resolution climate projection dataset and the crucial need to
   assess the impact of climate change on agricultural production, the
   overarching goal of this study was to systematically and comprehensively
   predict future droughts at unprecedented resolutions over China as a
   whole. rather than region-specific projections, and then to further
   investigate its impact on crop yield by innovatively using a soil water
   deficit drought index. Methodologically, the drought projections were
   quantified from very high resolution climate data and further predicted
   impacts on crop yield over China using the standardized
   precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at a relatively high (25
   km) spatial resolution from NASA's Earth Exchange Global Daily
   Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP). The results showed that (1) overall,
   China is projected to experience a significant decrease in SPEI
   (-0.15/decade under RCP (representative concentration pathway) 4.5;
   -0.14/decade under RCP8.5). Seasonally, the decreasing rate of SPEI is
   projected to be largest in winter (-0.2/decade and -0.31/decade) and the
   least in summer (-0.08/decade and -0.10/decade) under respective RCPs.
   (2) Regionally, winter/spring will get drier, especially at high
   latitudes/altitudes (North China and Tibetan plateau), and summer/autumn
   will get wetter in southern China. (3) Both the frequency and duration
   for medium and severe drought are projected to decrease, while extreme
   drought, particularly in high latitudes/altitudes, is projected to
   increase. (4) The percentage of the potential crop production affected
   by drought would increase to 36\% (47\%) by 2100 under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5).
   Especially, the ratio impacted by extreme drought is projected to
   increase over time and with much worse magnitude under RCP8.5; thus,
   adaptive crop policies are expected to address such a risk.},

Abstract = {To assess the long-term variations in the trend of the mean monthly land
   surface temperature, LST products from the MODIS sensor on Terra
   satellite (MOD11A1) were employed. A total of 1365 daily images of LST
   MODIS were provided from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive
   Center for April (450 images), May (465 images), and June (450 images)
   months. Then the mean monthly land surface temperature (LST) was
   estimated separately using daily land surface temperature (LST) time
   series for 3 months, April, May, and June, as well as for the total
   statistical period studied. A total number of 30,080 pixels were
   investigated within the studied area according to spatial resolution 1
   in 1 km each image. Finally, the long-term variations trend of the mean
   monthly land surface temperature was evaluated using Sen's slope
   estimator and classic linear regression on a pixel basis. According to
   the results, there was no significant difference in both models about
   the estimation of long-term variations trend of the mean monthly LST and
   they had the same performance. The results of this research also showed
   that the highest increasing trends in LST was observed in the north of
   the plain, which may be due to the drying up of Hamoun triple wetlands.
   However, the highest decreasing trends in LST was observed in the
   northeast, southwest, and west of the study area, which may be
   attributed to the expansion of agricultural lands and gardens in the
   northeastern part of the plain (along the main branch of Hirmand River)
   and digging of small wells in the southwest and west of the plain by
   indigenous peoples as well as the use of supply water for farming.},

Title = {High-quality sea surface temperature measurements along coast of the

Abstract = {As semi-enclosed and shallow seas, the Bohai and Yellow Seas (hereafter,
   BYS) marine ecosystems are more easily affected by natural and
   anthropogenic climate changes than those in the open oceans. An accurate
   assessment of sea surface temperature (SST) change is crucial for the
   near-shore water environment. In this work, new high-quality monthly
   mean SST time series from 11 in situ coastal hydrological stations at
   BYS for the period of 1960-2012 have been generated. Monthly mean SST
   time series were initially subjected to penalized maximal t (PMT) test,
   using homogeneous monthly mean surface air temperature (SAT) series as
   references. Homogenized monthly mean SST series were obtained by
   adjusting all significant change points which have been supported by
   historic metadata. Our study shows that there are 29 significant change
   points in these 11 SST series. The majority of them are caused by
   instrument changes and station relocations-both account for about 51.7
   and 31\%, respectively. Then, homogeneous SST series are used to assess
   the long-term trends. As the regional average, the annual mean
   homogeneous SST series shows a rapid warming trend, with the rate of
   0.21 degrees C/decade. Compared to the homogeneous SST series, the
   original SST series underestimate the long-term trend (only 0.13 degrees
   C/decade), indicating the artificial change points usually result in a
   warm-bias in the early period measurements. Seasonally, the most
   significant warming occurs in boreal winter during the period analysed.
   The relationships of the significant warming in boreal winter and
   atmospheric circulation modes have also been investigated. Results
   reflect the remarkable and direct influence of the East Asian Trough
   (EAT) on SST along the coastal BYS.},

Abstract = {Contrasts in high-elevation surface and free-tropospheric temperatures
   between 1971 and 1996 are examined by comparing surface temperatures
   from a subset of 72 stations in the GHCN (Global Historical Climate
   Network) and CRU (Climatic Research Unit) homogeneity adjusted surface
   data sets with free-air temperatures interpolated to the same locations
   from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis R1. The selected stations are above the mean
   elevation of the surrounding topography, often located on mountain
   summits. Surface temperatures, free-air temperatures, and their
   difference (Delta T) are found to be related to independent surface
   cloud observations from the NDP-026C archive, local wind speed,
   satellite records of snow cover (NSIDC), and reanalysis wind components.
   Significant correlations are observed at most stations, and correlation
   spatial patterns are consistent for different subperiods of the record
   (e.g., presatellite era versus satellite era). Stepwise regression
   models built to predict surface temperatures, free-air temperatures, and
   Delta T from the above meteorological parameters typically explain
   20-40\% of the temperature variability on an annual basis and more for
   individual seasons. The stationarity of relationships between
   temperature and snow/cloud/wind is examined by comparing the temporal
   trends in the original temperatures with predicted trends from the best
   fit regression model and trends in model residuals. This provides an
   assessment of how much of any Delta T trends can be accounted for by
   changes in meteorology. Significant daytime Delta T residual trends
   occur primarily in Turkey and eastern China, but significant nighttime
   Delta T residual trends are more geographically widespread. While
   daytime residual trends may be the result of surface radiative cooling
   by increasing anthropogenic aerosol, attribution of nighttime residual
   trends is uncertain.},

Abstract = {On the basis of analysis of archival hydrologic data, the cooling and
   freshening of the upper layer in the western part of the Black Sea was
   shown to occur in the cold period of the year during the 1960s-1990s. In
   the northern part of the Cape Chersonese-Bosporus Strait secular
   section, their values attained -1degreesC/10 yr and -0.1\%/10 yr,
   respectively. An increase in the winter discharge of the main rivers
   flowing into the Black Sea and additional turbulent entrainment of
   thermoclinic waters into the upper mixed layer are among the main
   factors responsible for this phenomenon. It is not inconceivable that a
   long-term increase in precipitation over some parts of the Black Sea
   water area also plays an important role. The linear trends of
   temperature and salinity in the upper layer of the Black Sea separated
   out of their 30-year series are largely caused by the presence of a
   quasi-periodic signal with a typical period of similar to50 yr
   recognizable from various hydrometeorological parameters and associated
   with low-frequency variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation.},

Journal = {CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {66},

Abstract = {Long-term trends in sea surface temperature (SST) in Omura Bay were
   investigated using heat balance estimates based on a daily data set
   obtained for 40 years (1955-1995) by the National Pearl Research
   Laboratory. SST during the heating period (from March to August) tended
   to decrease, whereas that during most of the cooling period (from
   September to February) increased during these 40 years. The maximum
   rates of SST decrease and increase were found to be 0.020 degrees C
   year(-1) in August and 0.028 degrees C year(-1) in January,
   respectively. The sea surface heat balance analysis revealed that
   shortwave radiation flux decreased in the heating period due to decrease
   in solar radiation, resulting in a decrease in SST. In the cooling
   period, the increase in SST was attributed to the decrease in latent and
   sensible heat fluxes due to increased air temperature and decreased wind
   speed. These climatic changes affecting SST in Omura Bay showed a close
   linkage with global dimming and the East Asian monsoon circulation. (C)

Title = {Recent temperature trends in the South Central Andes reconstructed from

   38°28 S, Chile)},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},

Abstract = {In this study we present a quantitative, high resolution reconstruction
   of past austral winter length in the Chilean Andes at 38 degrees S from
   AD 1920 to 2009. For Laguna Escondida, a nearly pristine lake situated
   on the flanks of the Andes at 1740 m above sea level, past variability
   in the duration of the winter season (Days T-4 (degrees c)) was
   reconstructed. Because high elevation meteorological stations are absent
   in this region, the reconstruction provides novel insights into recent
   temperature trends in the central-southern Andes. As a cold -season
   temperature proxy, we used chrysophyte stomatocysts. This novel proxy
   for cold season temperature was so far applied successfully in the
   European Alps and Pyrenees but has not yet been tested in the Southern
   Hemisphere. The reconstruction in this study was based on a newly
   developed Transfer Function to estimate Days T-4 degrees c (number of
   consecutive days with surface water temperatures at or below 4 degrees
   C) from sedimentary stomatocyst assemblages (R-boot(2) = 0.8, RMSEPboot
   = 28.7 days (= half the standard deviation)). To develop a high quality
   TF model, sediment traps and thermistors were placed in thirty remote
   lakes along an altitude gradient (420-2040 m Complete materials and data
   were collected in 24 lakes after one year. Detailed statistical analyses
   indicate that modern stomatocysts primarily respond to the length of the
   cold season. The TF model was then applied to the sedimentary
   stomatocysts from a Pb-210-dated short core of L. Escondida. Comparison
   to independent reanalysis data showed that reconstructed changes in Days
   T-4 degrees c provides detailed information on winter -spring
   temperature variability since AD 1920.
   The reconstruction shows that recent warming (onset in AD 1980) in the
   southern Chilean Andes was not exceptional in the context of the past
   century. This is in strong contrast to studies from the Northern
   Hemisphere. The finding is also in contrast to the cooling temperature
   trends which were detected using meteorological measurement data in low
   altitude sites along the Chilean coast. This finding confirms that
   coastal meteorological station data in this region do not reliably
   reflect recent temperature trends at high altitudes. Moreover, it
   implies a southward shift of the northern border of the Westerlies wind
   belt. This study clearly illustrates the importance of quantitative,
   high resolution studies from remote sites, in particular at high
   elevation mountain areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The novel coronavirus, since its first outbreak in December, has, up
   till now, affected approximately 114,542 people across 115 countries.
   Many international agencies are devoting efforts to enhance the
   understanding of the evolving COVID-19 outbreak on an international
   level, its influences, and preparedness. At present, COVID-19 appears to
   affect individuals through person-to-person means, like other commonly
   found cold or influenza viruses. It is widely known and acknowledged
   that viruses causing influenza peak during cold temperatures and
   gradually subside in the warmer temperature, owing to their seasonality.
   Thus, COVID-19, due to its regular flu-like symptoms, is also expected
   to show similar seasonality and subside as the global temperatures rise
   in the northern hemisphere with the onset of spring. Despite these
   speculations, however, the systematic analysis in the global perspective
   of the relation between COVID-19 spread and meteorological parameters is
   unavailable. Here, by analyzing the region- and city-specific affected
   global data and corresponding meteorological parameters, we show that
   there is an optimum range of temperature and UV index strongly affecting
   the spread and survival of the virus, whereas precipitation, relative
   humidity, cloud cover, etc. have no effect on the virus. Unavailability
   of pharmaceutical interventions would require greater preparedness and
   alert for the effective control of COVID-19. Under these conditions, the
   information provided here could be very helpful for the global community
   struggling to fight this global crisis. It is, however, important to
   note that the information presented here clearly lacks any physiological
   evidences, which may merit further investigation. Thus, any attempt for
   management, implementation, and evaluation strategies responding to the
   crisis arising due to the COVID-19 outbreak must not consider the
   evaluation presented here as the foremost factor.},

   bio-meteorological conditions based on temperature and relative humidity
   related index called Heat Index (HI) in India. Monthly mean maximum

   meteorological stations in India were used to analyze HI during summer
   (March to May) and monsoon (June to September) seasons for the last 60
   years (1951 to 2010). The long-period climatology of HI suggests that
   all the regions of the country except the hilly regions are affected by
   human discomfort of varying levels during summer and monsoon seasons.
   The results showed increasing trend of HI in almost all the regions of
   India during the study period. Averaged over the country, HI is
   increasing during summer and monsoon seasons at the rate of +0.56
   degrees C/decade and +0.32 degrees C/decade respectively which is
   statistically significant at 95\% level. The increasing HI indicates
   high level of discomfort in both the seasons which is primarily due to
   increase in humidity in summer season and maximum temperature in monsoon
   season. Spatial distribution of HI indicates greater chances of heat
   related illness in India, more prominently in the southeast coastal
   regions (Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Tamil Nadu) in summer and over
   northwest India (Rajasthan and Indo-Gangetic plains) in monsoon.},

Title = {Analysing the day/night seasonal and annual changes and trends in land
   surface temperature and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) for
   Indian cities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding the patterns and possible causes of urban heat islands
   (UHI) effect due to urbanisation-induced anthropogenic activities is an
   important area in urban climatic research. Few studies on long-term
   thermal behaviour of Indian cities are available in the literature.
   Towards this, the present study investigates the day/ night seasonal and
   annual changes and trends in land surface temperature (LST) and surface
   urban heat island intensity (SUHII) during the last two decades for
   three Indian cities (Lucknow, Kolkata and Pune) with distinct urban,
   physiographic and climatic setting. Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data products acquired during daytime and
   nighttime from 2001 to 2018 are processed and analysed for this purpose.
   MODIS-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) and normalised difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) products are used to understand the plausible
   reasons of change in LST and SUHII patterns. The urban (contiguous
   built-up) and nonurban (surrounding rural) areas are delineated by
   applying city clustering algorithm on MODIS Land Cover datasets of 500 m
   spatial resolution. Mann-Kendall and Seasonal-Kendall tests along with
   Theil-Sen estimator are used for trend analysis. The findings show that
   the diurnal temperature range (DTR) has decreased from 2001 to 2018 due
   to higher increase in nighttime LST as compared to daytime. Nighttime
   LST is a better indicator to study the urban heating effect due to its
   sensitivity towards urbanisation. Positive trends in mean annual daytime
   (0.003 to 0.059 degrees C/year) and nighttime (0.030 to 0.078 degrees
   C/year) LST are observed in all cities, except in Pune where urban
   cooling occurs during daytime. Increase in aerosol loading (with
   consequent decrease in air temperature and surface insolation) and
   vegetative cover over time are attributed as the primary reasons of
   urban cooling effect in Pune during daytime. Seasonal analysis indicate
   high warming rates during monsoon and summer seasons, particularly
   during nighttime (0.062 to 0.1 degrees C/year). Nighttime SUHII is
   positive for all cities with mean annual SUHII ranging from 1.34 to 2.07
   degrees C. Statistically significant (p<0.01) increasing trends are
   observed in mean annual SUHII (0.009 degrees C/year to 0.022 degrees
   C/year) for Kolkata and Pune. Decreasing trend in SUHII is observed over
   Lucknow due to higher rate of increase in LST in non-urban area as
   compared to urban area. The study highlights that geographical,
   physiographic and climatic setting along with anthropogenic processes in
   urban and its surrounding non-urban areas are critical towards
   understanding the causative factors in exacerbating the phenomenon of
   urban heating.},

Abstract = {Regional responses to surface warming are strongly influenced by the
   availability of surface or atmospheric moisture. For example,
   differences in evapotranspiration, atmospheric temperature lapse rate
   and heat capacity due to the availability of water over oceans and its
   lack over land contribute to an observed land/ocean warming ratio that
   is greater than one. This study shows that mechanisms related to the
   distributions of soil or atmospheric moisture could result in variations
   in regional climate change over land in the tropics and subtropics.
   Using atmospheric reanalyses and observations for the satellite era
   (1979-2016) within +/- 30 degrees latitude, the analysis shows that dry
   regions such as northern and southern Africa and south-central Australia
   have a significant negative regional spatial correlation between
   time-averaged soil moisture/evapotranspiration and surface temperature
   trends. In contrast, wet tropical regions such as Amazonia and the Congo
   Basin display a significant positive spatial correlation between these
   quantities. Spatial correlations suggest that a regional amplification
   of surface temperature trends in wet regions could be associated with a
   robust positive longwave radiative effect of high clouds which co-occur
   with wet soils. This positive relationship is strongest during austral
   summer, dominated by the summer seasons in the Amazon and Congo basins.
   These differences in regional sensitivity to greenhouse gas warming can
   be consequential for regional climate change assessment, for both
   tropical forests, which could already be operating at their high
   temperature limit, and also for dry desert regions, which are already
   marginal for supporting life.},

Title = {Roles of Sea Surface Temperature Warming and Loss of Arctic Sea Ice in
   the Enhanced Summer Wetting Trend Over Northeastern Siberia During
   Recent Decades},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The water cycle over middle- to high-latitude regions has experienced
   rapid changes in recent decades. The sea surface temperature (SST) and
   Arctic sea ice influence the water cycle over these regions, but the
   relative roles of SST warming and the loss of Arctic sea ice remain
   unclear. We identify an enhanced change in the summer (June-August)
   water cycle over northeastern Siberia (55-70 degrees N, 100-170 degrees
   E) during the last three decades. The driving force of this enhanced
   wetting trend is investigated using both observations and model
   simulations. An increasing trend of low-level southerly winds and a
   decrease in sea-level pressure are observed over northeastern Siberia
   during summer, leading to stronger lower tropospheric moisture
   convergence and ascending motion, which favor an increase in
   precipitation. The wetting trend and the associated atmospheric features
   are successfully reproduced by an atmospheric model driven by the
   observed Arctic sea ice concentrations and SSTs, whereas the model
   driven solely by the Arctic sea ice concentrations simulates a
   negligible increase in precipitation. This is primarily due to the
   absence of the stronger southerly winds that transport moisture from the
   Pacific Ocean. The modeling evidence suggests that SST changes in recent
   decades have a stronger influence on the intensified precipitation than
   does sea ice. An atmospheric bridge mechanism links the strengthened
   southerly winds to an upper-level Rossby wave train originating from the
   North Atlantic. Another atmospheric simulation forced only by Atlantic
   SST warming recreates the observed enhanced wetting trend in
   northeastern Siberia and supports the hypothesized atmospheric bridge
   mechanism.},

Abstract = {We use 25 years of Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data
   from NOAA Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites received by six
   Australian and two Antarctic reception stations to construct a detailed
   climatology of sea surface temperature (SST) around Australasia. The
   data have been processed following international GHRSST protocols to
   help reduce instrument bias using in situ data, with only night-time
   nearly cloud-free data used to reduce diurnal bias and cloud
   contamination. A pixel-wise climatology (with four annual sinusoids) and
   linear trend are fit to the data using a robust technique and monthly
   non-seasonal percentiles derived. The resulting Atlas, known as the SST
   Atlas of Australian Regional Seas (SSTAARS), has a spatial resolution of
   similar to 2 km and thus reveals unprecedented detail of regional
   oceanographic phenomena, including tidally-driven entrainment cooling
   over shelves and reef flats, wind-driven upwelling, shelf winter water
   fronts, cold river plumes, the footprint of the seasonal boundary
   current flows and standing mesoscale features in the major offshore
   currents. The Atlas (and associated statistics) will provide a benchmark
   for high-resolution ocean modelers and be a resource for ecosystem
   studies where temperatures, and their extremes, impact on ocean
   chemistry, species ranges and distribution.},

Abstract = {A sodium resonance lidar at 589 nm has been operated in Sao Jose dos
   Campos, Brazil (23 degrees S, 46 degrees W) since 1972 mainly for
   studies related to the origin, chemistry and dynamics of the mesospheric
   sodium layer. Beginning in 1993, the improved laser capability has also
   enabled the processing of the Rayleigh signal from which the
   temperatures from similar to 35 to similar to 65 km are retrieved on a
   nightly mean basis. We used these nightly profiles to determine the
   monthly temperature profiles from 1993 to 2006. The mean temperature
   characteristics for each year and for the whole period are obtained.
   Seasonal thermal amplitude is small (6K peak to peak at 40 and 60 km).
   Compared with the MSISE-90 model, a large difference is noted, with
   temperature lower than the model below the stratopause and higher above.
   Also the seasonal variation has a large difference with better agreement
   occurring around local winter, but with temperatures higher by similar
   to 8-10 K at the equinoxes. The semiannual component is dominant over
   the annual at all altitudes. Linear trends with decreasing temperature
   of 1.09, 2.29 and 1.42 K/decade are observed at 40, 50 and 60 km,
   respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An Examination of Temperature Trends at High Elevations Across the
   Tibetan Plateau: The Use of MODIS LST to Understand Patterns of
   Elevation-Dependent Warming},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {124},
Number = {11},
Pages = {5738-5756},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Research has revealed systematic changes in warming rates with elevation
   (EDW) in mountain regions. However, weather stations on the Tibetan
   plateau are mostly located at lower elevations (3,000-4,000 m) and are
   nonexistent above 5,000 m, leaving critical temperature changes unknown.
   Satellite LST (Land Surface Temperature) can fill this gap but needs
   calibrating against in situ air temperatures (T-air). We develop a novel
   statistical model to convert LST to T-air, developed at 87
   high-elevation Chinese Meteorological Administration stations. T-air
   (daily maximum/minimum temperatures) is compared with Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua LST (1330 and 0130
   local time) for 8-day composites during 2002-2017. Typically, 80-95\% of
   the difference between LST and T-air (Delta T) is explained using
   predictors including LST diurnal range, morning heating/nighttime
   cooling rates, the number of cloud free days/nights, and season (solar
   angle). LST is corrected to more closely represent T-air by subtracting
   modeled Delta T. We validate the model using an AWS on Zhadang Glacier
   (5800 m). Trend analysis at the 87 stations (2002-2017) shows corrected
   LST trends to be similar to original T-air trends. To examine regional
   contrasts in EDW patterns, elevation profiles of corrected LST trends
   are derived for three ranges (Qilian Mountains, NyenchenTanglha, and
   Himalaya). There is limited EDW in the Qilian mountains. Maximum warming
   is observed around 4,500-5,500 m in NyenchenTanglha, consistent with
   snowline retreat. In common with other studies, there is stabilization
   of warming at very high elevations in the Himalaya, including absolute
   cooling above 6,000 m, but data there are compromised by frequent cloud.},

Title = {Regional cooling in a warming world: Recent temperature trends in the
   southeast Pacific and along the west coast of subtropical South America
   (1979-2006)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2009},

Month = {FEB 18},
Abstract = {While it is widely accepted that the global mean atmospheric temperature
   has increased in recent decades, the spatial distribution of global
   warming has been complex. In this study we comprehensively characterize
   the spatial pattern, including vertical structure, of temperature trends
   along the subtropical west coast of South America ( continental Chile)
   for the period 1979-2006 and examine their consistency with expectations
   based on the CMIP-3 ensemble of coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations for
   the late 20th century. In central and northern Chile (17 degrees-37
   degrees S) the most notable feature is a strong contrast between surface
   cooling at coastal stations (-0.2 degrees C/decade) and warming in the
   Andes (+0.25 degrees C/decade), only 100-200 km further inland. Coastal
   radiosonde data imply that the coast-Andes variation is largely due to
   strong vertical stratification of temperature trends in the atmosphere
   west of the Andes. The coastal cooling appears to form part of a
   larger-scale, La Nina-like pattern and may extend below the ocean mixed
   layer to depths of at least 500 m. Over continental Chile the CMIP-3 GCM
   ensemble predicts temperature trends similar to those observed in the
   Andes. The cooling along the Chilean coast is not reproduced by the
   models, but the mean SST warming is weaker there than any other part of
   the world except the Southern Ocean. It is proposed that the
   intensification of the South Pacific Anticyclone during recent decades,
   which is also a simulated consequence of global warming, is likely to
   play a major role in maintaining cooler temperatures off the coast of
   Chile.},

Abstract = {This paper examines long-term series of in situ sea surface temperature
   (SST) data measured at nine coastal and one open sea stations along the
   eastern Adriatic Sea for the period 1959-2015. Monthly and yearly
   averages were used to document SST trends and variability, while
   clustering and connections to hemispheric indices were achieved by
   applying the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Self-Organizing Maps
   (SOM) method. Both PCA and SOM revealed the dominance of temporal
   changes with respect to the effects of spatial differences in SST
   anomalies, indicating the prevalence of hemispheric processes over local
   dynamics, such as bora wind spatial inhomogeneity. SST extremes were
   connected with blocking atmospheric patterns. A substantial warming
   between 1979 and 2015, in total exceeding 1 degrees C, was preceded by a
   period with a negative SST trend, implying strong multidecadal
   variability in the Adriatic. The strongest connection was found between
   yearly SST and the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, while North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) and East Atlantic/West Russia (EAWR) patterns were
   found to also affect February SST values. Quantification of the Adriatic
   SST and their connection to hemispheric indices allow for more precise
   projections of future SST, considered to be rather important for
   Adriatic thermohaline circulation, biogeochemistry and fisheries, and
   sensitive to ongoing climate change.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Recent doubts regarding the efficacy may have resulted in a
   loss of interest for targeted temperature management (TTM) in comatose
   cardiac arrest (CA) patients, with uncertain consequences on outcome. We
   aimed to identify a change in TTM use and to assess the relationship
   between this change and neurological outcome.
   Methods: We used Utstein data prospectively collected in the Sudden
   Death Expertise Center (SDEC) registry (capturing CA data from all
   secondary and tertiary hospitals located in the Great Paris area,
   France) between May 2011 and December 2017. All cases of non-traumatic
   OHCA patients with stable return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were
   included. After adjustment for potential confounders, we assessed the
   relationship between changes over time in the use of TTM and
   neurological recovery at discharge using the Cerebral Performance
   Categories (CPC) scale.
   Results: Between May 2011 and December 2017, 3925 patients were retained
   in the analysis, of whom 1847 (47\%) received TTM. The rate of good
   neurological outcome at discharge (CPC 1 or 2) was higher in TTM
   patients as compared with no TTM (33\% vs 15\%, P < 0.001). Gender, age,
   and location of CA did not change over the years. Bystander CPR
   increased from 55\% in 2011 to 73\% in 2017 (P < 0.001) and patients
   with a no-flow time longer than 3 min decreased from 53 to 38\% (P <
   0.001). The use of TTM decreased from 55\% in 2011 to 37\% in 2017 (P <
   0.001). Meanwhile, the rate of patients with good neurological recovery
   remained stable (19 to 23\%, P = 0.76). After adjustment, year of CA
   occurrence was not associated with outcome.
   Conclusions: We report a progressive decrease in the use of TTM in
   post-cardiac arrest patients over the recent years. During this period,
   neurological outcome remained stable, despite an increase in
   bystander-initiated resuscitation and a decrease in ``no flow{''}

Abstract = {Temperature dynamics is a widely recognized indicator of the global
   warming phenomenon. Changes in temperature patterns in Bhubaneswar,
   India, were assessed by examining the monthly minimum and maximum
   temperature data for 60 years (1956-2015) sourced from the Indian
   Meteorological Department. SimCLIM climate change risk assessment
   software was used for projecting the temperature regime for four
   different representative concentration pathways. Further, a survey of
   112 farmers was conducted to understand their perceptions of temperature
   variations in and around Bhubaneswar city using a multi-stage sampling
   technique. Mann-Kendall statistics and linear regression were used to
   analyze the monthly temperature data and trend detection. The study
   reveals a change of +4\%,-4.44\%, and +1.09\% in the mean monthly
   maximum, minimum, and annual temperature. The results of the future
   projection show a temperature change of 0.81 degrees C for RCP 2.6, 1.12
   degrees C for RCP 4.5, 1.03 degrees C for RCP 6.0, and 1.54 degrees C
   for RCP 8.5 for the year 2050. Confirming the analysis findings, most of
   the interviewed farmers also perceived increasing temperatures and
   decreasing precipitation in and around the city. The study outcome of
   temperature trend analysis and future projections will be helpful for
   farmers and policymakers in formulating adaptation strategies to climate
   change.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal trends of mean air temperature during 1961-2009 and
   impacts on crop (maize) yields in the most important agricultural region
   of Romania},

Abstract = {Climate change analysis is essential, considering the numerous economic
   and ecological implications of this critical global environmental issue.
   This paper analyzes the spatial and temporal trends of mean air
   temperature in Romania's most important agricultural area, the south and
   south-eastern region, between 1961 and 2009. In this respect,
   multiannual (the entire period) and multidecadal (1961-1990, 1971-2000,
   1981-2009) trends were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's
   slope method at 23 weather stations, annually, seasonally and for the
   growing season of the region's main agricultural crops (maize and
   wheat). Multiannually, the results showed statistically significant
   temperature increases, on all temporal scales (maximum rate of 0.06 A
   degrees C/year recorded in summer, equivalent to a net temperature rise
   of 2.82 A degrees C), except for the autumn season (cooling without
   statistical significance). Multidecadally, the 1961-1990 period is
   marked by a general cooling, especially in autumn (maximum values of
   -0.07 A degrees C/year or over 2 A degrees C net cooling). In the
   1971-2000 and 1981-2009 periods, a general warming was observed (maximum
   in summer for both multidecades, when positive rates peaked at 0.09 A
   degrees C/year, or 2.5-3 A degrees C net warming), but the warming of
   the last three decades is the most prominent in terms of spatial average
   magnitude and trend significance. Upon analysis of the impact of climate
   warming on agricultural yields (maize) through linear regression, in the
   1991-2000 decade, considered as case study, it was found that in 32 \%
   of the total analyzed area there are evident relationships between the
   two variables (p value < 0.05). In this case, a dependency of 33-50 \%
   (40 \%, on average) of maize to climate was found, and a sensitivity
   (loss) ranging between 0.9 and 1.5 t/ha/year (1.2 t/ha/year, on average)
   for a 1 A degrees C temperature rise. At the same time, significant
   losses (of up to 1.7 t/ha/year) of maize for a 1 A degrees C temperature
   rise were identified in 51 \% of the area, but with little p value
   significance (between 0.05 and 0.1). It is however necessary to analyse
   the agro-climatic results cautiously, considering that only one decade
   of climate-agriculture relationship was studied. The results can be
   useful first and foremost for mitigating the climate change impact on
   agricultural systems, by prioritizing future adaptation strategies
   enforced by policy makers.},

Abstract = {The effect of climate prevails on a diverse time scale from days to
   seasons and decades. Between 1993 and 2013, global warming appeared to
   have paused even though there was an increase in atmospheric greenhouse
   gases. The variations in oceanographic variables, like current speed and
   sea surface temperature (SST), under the influence of the global warming
   hiatus (1993-2013), have drawn the attention of the global research
   community. However, the magnitude of ocean current and SST
   characteristics oscillates and varies with their geographic locations.
   Consequently, investigating the spatio-temporal changing aspects of
   oceanographic parameters in the backdrop of climate change is essential,
   specifically in coastal regions along Kuroshio current (KC), where
   fisheries are predominant. This study analyzes the trend of ocean
   current and SST induced mainly during the global warming hiatus, before
   and till the recent time based on the daily ocean current data from 1993
   to 2020 and SST between 1982 and 2020. The Kuroshio extent is delineated
   from its surrounding water masses using an aggregation of raster
   classification, stretching, equalization, and spatial filters such as
   edge detection, convolution, and Laplacian. Finally, on the extracted
   Kuroshio extent, analyses such as time series decomposition (additive)
   and statistical trend computation methods (Yue and Wang trend test and
   Theil-Sen's slope estimator) were applied to dissect and investigate the
   situations. An interesting downward trend is observed in the KC between
   the East coast of Taiwan and Tokara Strait (Tau = -0.05, S = -2430,
   Sen's slope = -5.19 x 10-5, and Z = -2.61), whereas an upward trend from
   Tokara Strait to Nagoya (Tau = 0.89, S = 4344, Sen's slope = 8.4 x 10-5,
   and Z = 2.56). In contrast, a consistent increasing SST in trend is
   visualized in the southern and mid-KC sections but with varying
   magnitude.},

Abstract = {Purpose Investigating the performance of the new Dophi (TM) M150E
   Microwave Ablation System, in terms of temperature distribution,
   ablation size and shape, reproducibility.
   Materials and Methods The Dophi (TM) M150E Microwave Ablation System was
   tested on ex vivo liver, lung and kidney, at 6 different settings of
   time, power and number of MW antennas (single antenna: 50 and 100 W at 5
   and 10 min; double antenna: 75 W at 5 and 10 min). The temperature
   distribution was recorded by Fiber Bragg Grating sensors, placed at
   different distances from the antennas. The ablation axes were measured
   and the sphericity index was calculated.
   Results The standard deviation of ablation axes was < 5 mm, except at
   the highest energy and time setting for the lung. A maximum temperature
   rise of similar to 80 degrees C was measured. The measured ablation axes
   are overall comparable with the manufacture's values, especially at
   lower power and with one MW antenna (average maximum difference is 7
   mm). The mean sphericity index of 0.95, 0.79 and 0.9 was obtained for
   the liver, lung and kidney, respectively, with a single antenna. With
   double antenna setup, the sphericity index was closer to 1 when 75 W for
   10 min were used.
   Conclusions Dophi (TM) M150E allows good reproducibility of ablation
   axes for all cases except in the lung at the highest energy level. With
   one antenna, an almost spherical ablation area for the liver and kidney
   was obtained. Using double antenna results in more homogeneous
   temperature distribution within the tissue compared to single antenna.},

Abstract = {The prediction for distribution trends and effect of three 4d transition
   metal elements (Ru, Rh and Pd) on mechanical properties and martensitic
   transformation temperature of B2-ZrCu phase were investigated by first
   principles calculations. The convex surface of formation energy suggests
   that the alloying elements prefer to occupy the Cu sites in B2-ZrCu
   phase and the dopants studied in present are able to strengthen the
   phase stability. The calculated results of substitutional formation
   energy suggest that the distribution trend of dopants in B2-ZrCu phase
   is Ru > Rh > Pd below the dopant concentration 9 at. \%, and the
   distribution trend is Rh > Pd > Ru from 9 at. \% to 12.5 at. \%. The
   elastic constants and mechanical properties including bulk modulus and
   shear modulus were calculated and discussed. The brittleness/ductility
   characteristic was investigated using the B/G ratio, Poisson's ratio v
   and Cauchy pressure C-p. The martensitic transformation temperature
   (M-s) and melting point (T-m) were predicted by using two cubic elastic
   moduli (C' and C-44). The prediction results suggest that only the Ms of
   Zr8Cu7Pd is higher than the parent. The martensitic transformation
   temperatures of other compounds decrease with the addition of 4d
   transition metal dopants. Finally, the electronic structures and
   electron density different were discussed to reveal the bonding
   characteristics.},

Abstract = {Increasing land surface temperature (LST) is one of the significant
   anthropogenic issues that is threatening livelihoods in urban areas.
   Understanding the urban LST is essential for sustainable management of
   the urban landscape. Various studies focused on the spatial pattern and
   average trend of LST in relation to influencing factors, but little is
   known regarding the pixel-scale spatiotemporal trends and integration of
   multiple influencing factors in the different seasons using time series
   data. Therefore, we focused on the spatiotemporal trends of LST in
   relation to the influencing factors using the Google Earth Engine
   platform and time series products. MODIS land surface temperature data
   was used to estimate the annual and seasonal day-night LST from 2003 to
   2020. Theil-Sen slope and Mann-Kendall statistics were used to examine
   the magnitude and significance of the spatiotemporal trend. All-subsets
   regression and hierarchical partitioning (HP) were applied to explore
   the driving factors of LST. Average LST and range varied between the
   cities, but were highest in Chennai and Delhi, respectively. Except for
   winter nighttime in Kolkata, all cities' annual and seasonal nighttime
   LST are increasing (0.027-0.075 degrees C/year) over a large part of the
   study area (33.934\%-100\% of areas), indicating that anthropogenic
   force is increasing in urban areas during nighttime. Annual and seasonal
   daytime LST is increasing in most parts (55.545\%-94.604\% of areas) of
   Chennai and Kolkata, but daytime LST is decreasing (33.602\%-98.571\% of
   areas) in Mumbai and Delhi due to the increasing concentration of
   absorbing aerosol over the city. Strength of independent factors and
   multiple influencing factors varied in the day-night time between the
   cities. But nighttime LST was well explained using the all-subsets
   regression compared to daytime LST, except for Mumbai. Also, nighttime
   light density and NDBI had consistent effects on nighttime, and daytime,
   respectively. These findings can help to take scientific adaptation and
   mitigation strategies for sustainable development.},

Title = {Different air temperature values and trends at two stations on a small
   island: the case of meteorological stations Korcula and Vela Luka on
   Korcula Island},
Journal = {HRVATSKE VODE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {183-196},
Abstract = {The paper contains the analysis of the series of mean annual, mean
   monthly and mean daily air temperatures at two meteorological stations,
   Vela Luka and Korcula, on Korcula Island. The present locations of the
   meteorological stations are 33.5 km apart (as the crow flies). The mean
   annual air temperature at the Vela Luka station is on average 1 degrees
   C lower than the one measured at the Korcula station. At both stations,
   a significant trend of increase in mean annual and mean monthly air
   temperatures has been observed, although it is significantly milder at
   the Vela Luka station. Using data from the main meteorological station
   Lastovo, the inhomogeneity of temperatures measured at the stations Vela
   Luka and Korcula resulting from non-climatic factors, one being the
   change in the locations of the stations, has been detected. Based on the
   analyses conducted in the paper, a conclusion can be drawn that global
   warming processes manifest faster at the Korcula station than at the
   Vela Luka station. Significantly different air temperature values and
   especially the fact that air temperatures respond differently to climate
   change at the two stations can be explained by their local position
   relative to the open sea and the orography of the surrounding bare karst
   terrain. The Vela Luka station is exposed to the influence of the open
   sea, it is far from the mainland and its temperature regime is probably
   affected by the depression of the karst field Blato. At the Korcula
   station, the influence of the sea is less significant because the water
   mass is located in the narrow channel between Korcula Island and the
   Peljesac peninsula. The distance of the Korcula meteorological station
   from the Peljesac peninsula and the mainland is smaller. The high
   mountain ranges of the Peljesac peninsula and the mainland, including
   the bare karst landscape, influence the faster trend of air temperature
   increase at this station compared to the Vela Luka station, where the
   impact of the sea mitigates the effect of global warming. It is of note
   that the presented results should be treated as preliminary results, and
   that the hypotheses should be confirmed by additional investigations
   based on new, more complex data and monitoring that are unavailable
   today.},

Title = {Ground-state energy trends in single and multilayered coupled InAs/GaAs

Abstract = {Vertically coupled, multilayered InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) covered
   with thin InGaAs strain-reducing layers (SRLs) are in demand for various
   technological applications. We investigated low temperature
   photoluminescence of single and multilayered structures in which the SRL
   thickness was varied. The SRL layer was responsible for high activation
   energies. Deviation of experimental data from ;the Varshni (1967) model,
   E(T) = E - infinity T-2/T + beta, suggests that the InAs-layered QDs
   have properties different from those in bulk material. Anomalous
   ground-state peak linewidths (FWHM), especially for annealed multilayer
   structures, were observed. A ground-state peak blue-shift with a
   broadened linewidth was also observed. Loss of intensity was detected in
   samples annealed at 800 degrees C. Presence of SRLs prevents formation
   of non-radiative centers under high temperature annealing. The results
   indicate the potential importance of such structures in optoelectronic
   applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The 105-year (1897-2001) surface air temperature record of the National
   Observatory of Athens (NOA) has been analysed to determine indications
   of significant deviations from long-term average features in the city of
   Athens. The analysis of the whole record reveals a tendency towards
   warmer years, with significantly warmer summer and spring periods and
   slightly warmer winters (an increase of 1.23 and 0.34 degreesC has been
   observed in the mean summer and mean winter temperature, respectively).
   The tendency is more pronounced for the summer and spring maximum
   temperature, but marginal for the minimum temperature of the cold
   season. On a monthly basis, a statistically significant (at the 95th
   confidence level) warming trend has been observed in the average maximum
   temperature of May and June. The trend analysis for the last decade of
   the record (1992-2001) revealed a significant increase for both warm and
   cold seasons. yet maximum and minimum temperature-Extreme temperatures
   (high/low temperatures above/below a certain threshold value) and
   extreme events (prolonged extreme temperatures) have also been studied.
   The number of hot days as well as the frequency of occurrence and
   duration of warm events have significantly increased during the last
   decade, while a negative trend is observed in the frequency of low,
   temperatures and the duration of cold events especially after 1960. (C)

Title = {Climate change and malaria: some recent trends of malaria incidence
   rates and average annual temperature in selected sub-Saharan African
   countries from 2000 to 2018},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {BackgroundMalaria is still a disease of massive burden in Africa, also
   influenced by climate change. The fluctuations and trends of the
   temperature and precipitation are well-known determinant factors
   influencing the disease's vectors and incidence rates. This study
   provides a concise account of malaria trends. It describes the
   association between average temperature and malaria incidence rates (IR)
   in nine sub-Saharan African countries: Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Africa,
   Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The incidence of
   malaria can vary both in areas where the disease is already present, and
   in regions where it is present in low numbers or absent. The increased
   vulnerability to the disease under increasing average temperatures and
   humidity is due to the new optimal level for vector breeding in areas
   where vector populations and transmission are low, and populations are
   sensitive due to low acquired immunity.MethodsA second source trend
   analysis was carried out of malaria cases and incidence rates (the
   number of new malaria cases per 1000 population at risk per year) with
   data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and average annual mean
   temperature from 2000 to 2018 from the World Bank's Climate Change
   Knowledge Portal (CCKP). Additionally, descriptive epidemiological
   methods were used to describe the development and trends in the selected
   countries. Furthermore, MS Excel was chosen for data analysis and
   visualization.ResultsFindings obtained from this article align with the
   recent literature, highlighting a declining trend (20-80\%) of malaria
   IR (incidence rate) from 2000 to 2018. However, malaria IR varies
   considerably, with high values in Uganda, Mozambique, Nigeria and
   Zambia, moderate values in Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, and low values in
   South Africa and Ethiopia in 2018. Evidence suggests varying IRs after
   average temperature fluctuations in several countries (e.g., Zimbabwe,
   Ethiopia). Also, an inverse temperature-IR relationship occurs, the
   sharp decrease of IR during 2012-2014 and 2000-2003, respectively,
   occurred with increasing average temperatures in Ghana and Nigeria. The
   decreasing trends and fluctuations, partly accompanying the temperature,
   should result from the intervention programmes and rainfall variability.
   The vulnerability and changing climate could arrest the recent trends of
   falling IR.ConclusionThus, malaria is still a crucial public health
   issue in sub-Saharan Africa, although a robust decreasing IR occurred in
   most studied countries.},

Abstract = {Oyster mushroom is one type of mushroom that is commonly consumed by
   Indonesian people which is relatively easy to cultivate. It can produce
   the optimum fruit body at temperatures below 30 degrees C, the range of
   humidity is 60-90\% with altitudes between 500-1000 meters above sea
   level. This paper describes on the development of the prototype of
   temperature and humidity control system in oyster mushroom cultivation
   using a fuzzy logic controller. The prototype comprises of DHT11 sensor
   for detecting temperature and humidity, Arduino microcontroller,
   mistmaker, and cooling fan. Fuzzy logic controller is installed in the
   Arduino microcontroller to generate an actuating signal for the
   mistmaker and cooling fan based on fuzzy inputs. The whole fuzzy system
   is designed using two inputs namely temperature and humidity with each
   input consist of three fuzzy sets with the triangular membership
   function. Meanwhile, the output variable is the speed of cooling fan
   with three fuzzy sets and triangular membership functions. A Mamdani
   inference system is adopted to achieve the control objective in the
   whole system. Based on the appropriate rule bases, fuzzy logic
   controllers are designed to produce the temperature and humidity
   setpoint around 27 degrees C and 60-90 \% respectively. Experimental
   results show the time response to achieve the setpoint span from 1
   minute 27 seconds until 8 minutes 10 seconds.},

Abstract = {The trend analysis approach is used to estimate changing climate and its
   impact on the environment, agriculture and water resources. Innovative
   polygonal trend analyses are qualitative methods applied to detect
   changes in the environment. In this study, the Innovative Trend Pivot
   Analysis Method (ITPAM) and Trend Polygon Star Concept Method were
   applied for temperature trend detection in Soan River Basin (SRB),
   Potohar region, Pakistan. The average monthly temperature data
   (1995-2020) for 11 stations were used to create polygon graphics. Trend
   length and slope were calculated separately for arithmetic mean and
   standard deviation. The innovative methods produced useful scientific
   information, with the identification of monthly shifts and trend
   behaviors of temperature data at different stations. Some stations
   showed an increasing trend and others showed decreasing behavior. This
   increasing and decreasing variability is the result of climate change.
   The winter season temperature is increasing, and the months of December
   to February are getting warmer. Summer is expanding and pushing autumn
   towards winter, swallowing the early period of the cold season. The
   monthly polygonal trends with risk graphs depicted a clear picture of
   climate change in the Potohar region of Pakistan. The phenomena of
   observed average temperature changes, indicated by both qualitative
   methods, are interesting and have the potential to aid water managers'
   understanding of the cropping system of the Potohar region.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies are on-going on to understand the performance of
   generation IV (Gen IV) nuclear power plants (NPPs). The objective is to
   determine optimum operating conditions for efficiency and economic
   reasons in line with the goals of Gen IV. For Gen IV concepts such as
   the gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs) and very-high temperature reactors
   (VHTRs), the choice of cycle configuration is influenced by component
   choices, the component configuration and the choice of coolant. The
   purpose of this paper to present and review current cycles being
   considered-the simple cycle recuperated (SCR) and the intercooled cycle
   recuperated (ICR). For both cycles, helium is considered as the coolant
   in a closed Brayton gas turbine configuration. Comparisons are made for
   design point (DP) and off-design point (ODP) analyses to emphasize the
   pros and cons of each cycle. This paper also discusses potential future
   trends, include higher reactor core outlet temperatures (COT) in excess
   of 1000 degrees C and the simplified cycle configurations.},

Title = {How Much Have Variations in the Meridional Overturning Circulation
   Contributed to Sea Surface Temperature Trends since 1850? A Study with
   the EC-Earth Global Climate Model},

Abstract = {The surface of the world's oceans has been warming since the beginning
   of industrialization. In addition to this, multidecadal sea surface
   temperature (SST) variations of internal origin exist. Evidence suggests
   that the North Atlantic Ocean exhibits the strongest multidecadal SST
   variations and that these variations are connected to the overturning
   circulation.
   This work investigates the extent to which these internal multidecadal
   variations have contributed to enhancing or diminishing the trend
   induced by the external radiative forcing, globally and in the North
   Atlantic. A model study is carried out wherein the analyses of a long
   control simulation with constant radiative forcing at preindustrial
   level and of an ensemble of simulations with historical forcing from
   1850 until 2005 are combined. First, it is noted that global SST trends
   calculated from the different historical simulations are similar, while
   there is a large disagreement between the North Atlantic SST trends.
   Then the control simulation is analyzed, where a relationship between
   SST anomalies and anomalies in the Atlantic meridional overturning
   circulation (AMOC) for multidecadal and longer time scales is
   identified. This relationship enables the extraction of the AMOC-related
   SST variability from each individual member of the ensemble of
   historical simulations and then the calculation of the SST trends with
   the AMOC-related variability excluded. For the global SST trends this
   causes only a little difference while SST trends with AMOC-related
   variability excluded for the North Atlantic show closer agreement than
   with the AMOC-related variability included. From this it is concluded
   that AMOC variability has contributed significantly to North Atlantic
   SST trends since the mid nineteenth century.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Daily and monthly maximum and minimum surface air temperatures at
   66 weather stations over the eastern and central Tibetan Plateau with
   elevations above 2000 m were analyzed for temporal trends and spatial
   variation patterns during the period 1961 - 2003. Statistically
   significant warming trends were identified in various measures of the
   temperature regime, such as temperatures of extreme events and diurnal
   temperature range. The warming trends in winter nighttime temperatures
   were among the highest when compared with other regions. We also
   confirmed the asymmetric pattern of greater warming trends in minimum or
   nighttime temperatures as compared to the daytime temperatures. The
   warming in regional climate caused the number of frost days to decrease
   significantly and the number of warm days to increase. The length of the
   growing season increased by approximately 17 days during the 43-year
   study period. Most of the record-setting months for cold events were
   found in the earlier part of the study period, while that of the warm
   events occurred mostly in the later half, especially since the 1990s.
   The changes in the temperature regime in this region may have brought
   regional-specific impacts on the ecosystems. It was found that grain
   production in Qinghai Province, located in the area of prominent warming
   trends, exhibited strong correlations with the temperatures, although
   such relationships were obscured by the influence of precipitation in
   this arid/semiarid environment in juniper tree ring records. In western
   Sichuan Province under a more humid environment, the tree growth (
   spruces) was more closely related to the changing temperatures.},

Title = {Global trends (1996-2003) of total column precipitable water observed by
   Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on ERS-2 and their relation to

Abstract = {{[} 1] We have analyzed global trends of total column precipitable water
   from measurements of the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on
   the European Research Satellite (ERS-2) for the period January 1996 to
   June 2003. In contrast to other satellite retrieval methods of total
   column precipitable water, our analysis does not rely on a priori
   assumptions or additional information; thus it is particularly well
   suited to trend studies. The chosen wavelength range in the red spectral
   region ensures similar sensitivity for observations over land and ocean
   and thus a consistent global picture. To minimize the influence of
   clouds on the water vapor trends, we selected observations under mainly
   clear-sky conditions. The temporal evolution of the monthly or yearly
   averaged total column precipitable water, especially in the tropics, is
   highly correlated to that of the near-surface temperature, indicating
   that the global atmospheric humidity is mainly driven by
   Clausius-Clapeyron's principle. The magnitude of the dependence on
   near-surface temperature indicates a strong water vapor feedback. The
   spatial patterns of the water vapor trends show both positive and
   negative signs. Especially over the oceans, trend patterns very similar
   to those of near-surface temperature are found. In contrast, over
   Northern Hemispheric continents the trend patterns are much less
   correlated, and even opposite trends for water vapor and the
   near-surface temperatures are found. During the period 1996 - 2002 the
   globally and yearly averaged total column precipitable water increased
   by 2.8 +/- 0.8\% ( excluding the ENSO period).},

Abstract = {In this paper, the surface and lower tropospheric temperature trends in
   Greece and their relationship to the atmospheric circulation for the
   period 1955-2013 were examined, updating the study of Feidas et al.
   (Theor Appl Climatol 79:185-208, 2004) for data observed during the
   12-year period 2002-2013. The trend analysis is based on a combination
   of three statistical tests. The trends are now examined for all the
   seasonal time series, new atmospheric circulation indices were added in
   the analysis, and maps with the spatial distribution of correlation
   between air temperature and atmospheric circulation were constructed and
   analysed. The series updated to 2013 for 18 stations reveal a clearer
   positive trend than that found for the period 1955-2001 on both the
   annual and the seasonal timescales. The warming signal detected only in
   summer in the study of Feidas et al. (Theor Appl Climatol 79:185-208,
   2004) has now intensified and spread in other seasons. This warming
   appears to be mainly caused by the very high temperatures in the last
   decade (after 2004) of the record. At the national scale, there is now a
   match between surface temperature trends in Greece and Northern
   Hemisphere (NH) but only for summer, spring and annual time series,
   which are the only time series presenting a statistically significant
   warming trend in Greece. Satellite-induced lower tropospheric
   temperatures now show a statistically significant tropospheric
   temperature warming trend for the period 1979-2013, for both areas
   (Greece and NH). Lower tropospheric and surface air temperatures for the
   same period (1979-2013) show a very good agreement, with differences
   only in winter and summer for Greece. The influence of atmospheric
   circulation on the temperature variability in Greece was also examined
   using two more circulation indices: the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern
   Index (EMPI) and the North-Sea Caspian Pattern Index (NCPI). EMPI and
   especially NCPI explain better now the temperature variance in Greece,
   principally in winter. This connection, however, is not only developed
   during winter, as expected, but is also present for annual and other
   seasonal temperatures.},

Title = {Low Temperature Water Gas Shift: Evaluation of Pt/HfO<sub>2</sub> and
   Correlation between Reaction Mechanism and Periodic Trends in
   Tetravalent (Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, Th) Metal Oxides},
Journal = {ACS CATALYSIS},
Year = {2011},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {It is well-known that catalysts containing small quantities of noble
   metals (e.g., Pt, Au) that are highly dispersed on Group Wand related
   tetravalent metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, ThO2) display, once
   activated, high conversion for water-gas shift (WGS). The mechanism
   suggested for this by many authors is bimolecular in nature. In one
   view, adsorption of CO on the partially reducible oxide produces
   formates by reaction with active bridging OH groups; followed by
   water-assisted formate decomposition by dehydrogenation, with this
   second step being facilitated by metal particles at the metal support
   interface. Considering this group of oxides, HfO2, as far as we are
   aware, had not yet been studied as a potential candidate for low
   temperature water-gas shift (LTWGS). Thus, in this contribution,
   catalysts composed of Pt supported on HfO2 were prepared and tested.
   Catalyst testing results suggest that this system is, like Pt/ZrO2 and
   Pt/CeO2, active for the WGS reaction, although additional studies are
   required to obtain an ordering of reactivity. Insight into the possible
   mechanism was gained through the use of diffuse reflectance infrared
   Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Formate bands were observed to
   form when defect-associated bridging OH groups, present on hafnia after
   partial reduction, were reacted with CO. Pt facilitated partial
   reduction of hafnia and thus the formation of the bridging OH groups on
   its surface. The formate bands readily disappeared in the presence of
   steam at 130 degrees C, converting to the second intermediate, carbonate
   species, which liberated CO2 and presumably H-2 products. Moreover, in
   switching from CO adsorption alone to steady state LTWGS, the formate
   bands became reaction rate limited-and more so at higher temperature.
   The implication is that formate is turning over more rapidly at the
   latter condition, with its decomposition (probably via C-H bond
   breaking) being the most likely rate limiting step. These experiments
   suggest that the reaction probably follows a bimolecular associative
   pathway, with adsorbed formate being an intermediate, in the same manner
   as observed with the other Group IV and related tetravalent oxide based
   LTWGS catalysts. Moreover, an interesting relationship may exist between
   the C-H bond strength of adsorbed formate (i.e., observed during CO
   adsorption) and the metal ion radius in the oxide.},

Abstract = {Along with climate change, unstable weather patterns are becoming more
   frequent. However, the temporal trend associated with the effect of
   temperature variation on schizophrenia (SCZ) is not clear. Daily
   time-series data on SCZ and meteorological factors for 15-year between
   January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2019 were collected. And we used the
   Poisson regression model combined with the time-varying distribution lag
   nonlinear model (DLNM) to explore the temporal trend of the association
   between three temperature variation indicators (diurnal temperature
   range, DTR; temperature variability, TV; temperature change between
   neighboring days, TCN) and SCZ hospitalizations, respectively.
   Meanwhile, we also explore the temporal trend of the interaction between
   temperature and temperature variation. Stratified analyses were
   performed in different gender, age, and season. Across the whole
   population, we found a decreasing trend in the risk of SCZ
   hospitalizations associated with high DTR (from 1.721 to 1.029), TCN
   (from 1.642 to 1.066), and TV (TV0-1, from 1.034 to 0.994; TV0-2, from
   1.041 to 0.994, TV0-3, from 1.044 to 0.992, TV0-4, from 1.049 to 0.992,
   TV0-5, from 1.055 to 0.993, TV0-6, from 1.059 to 0.991, TV0-7, from
   1.059 to 0.990), but an increasing trend in low DTR (from 0.589 to
   0.752). Subgroup analysis results further revealed different susceptible
   groups. Besides, the interactive effect suggests that temperature
   variation may cause greater harm under low-temperature conditions. There
   was a synergy between TCN and temperature on the addition and
   multiplication scales, which were 1.068 (1.007, 1.133) and 0.067 (0.009,
   0.122), respectively. Our findings highlight public health interventions
   to mitigate temperature variation effects needed to focus not only on
   high temperature variations but also moderately low temperature
   variations. Future hospitalizations for SCZ associated with temperature
   variation may be more severely affected by temperature variability from
   low temperature environments. The temporal trend is associated with the
   effect of temperature variation on schizophrenia (SCZ).},

Title = {Temporal trend and global burden of type 2 diabetes attributable to

   Disease Study 2019},

Abstract = {Exposure to hot or cold temperatures was reported to be associated with
   increased mortality and morbidity of type 2 diabetes, but few studies
   have estimated the temporal trend and global burden of type 2 diabetes
   attributable to non-optimal temperature. Based on the Global Burden of
   Disease Study 2019, we collected data on the numbers and rates of deaths
   and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of type 2 diabetes attributed
   to non-optimal temperature. The joinpoint regression analysis was used
   to estimate the temporal trends of the age-standardized rate of
   mortality and DALYs from 1990 to 2019 by average annual percentage
   change (AAPC). From 1990 to 2019, globally, the numbers of deaths and
   DALYs of type 2 diabetes attributable to non-optimal temperature
   increased by 136.13\% (95\% (uncertainty interval) UI: 87.04\% to
   277.76\%) and 122.26\% (95\% UI: 68.77\% to 275.59\%), with the number
   from 0.05 (95\% UI: 0.02 to 0.07) million and 0.96 (95\% UI: 0.37 to
   1.51) million in 1990 to 0. 11 (95\% UI: 0.07 to 0.15) million and 2.14
   (95\% UI: 1.35 to 3.13) million in 2019. The age-standardized mortality
   rate (ASMR) and DALYs rate (ASDR) of type 2 diabetes attributable to
   non-optimal temperature showed an increasing trend in the high
   temperature effect and lower (low, low-middle and middle)
   socio-demographic index (SDI) region, with AAPCs of 3.17\%, 1.24\%,
   1.61\%, and 0.79\% (all P < 0.05), respectively. The greatest increased
   ASMR and ASDR were observed in Central Asia, followed by Western
   Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Meanwhile, the contribution of type 2
   diabetes burden attributable to high temperature gradually increased
   globally and in five SDI regions. In addition, the global age-specific
   rate of mortality and DALYs of type 2 diabetes attributable to
   non-optimal temperature for both men and women almost increased with age
   in 2019. The global burden of type 2 diabetes attributable to
   non-optimal temperature increased from 1990 to 2019, particularly in
   high temperature, regions with lower SDI, and the older population.
   Appropriate temperature interventions are necessary to curb climate
   change and increasing diabetes.},

Title = {Unique Declining Electrochemical Trend of Macro-Cell Half-Cell Potential
   with Increase in Temperature at Constant High Humidity for Corroding
   Steel Bars in Repaired Concrete Patches},

Abstract = {This paper aims at finding the coupled effect of hot and humid
   environment on the corroded repaired patches of chloride contaminated
   steel reinforced concrete. Chloride induced corrosion under coupled
   environmental effects of high humidity and high temperature often found
   in gulf marine environment is a very serious threat for durability of
   reinforced concrete structures. In the previous research, the authors
   experimentally corroborated re-corrosion in the repaired reinforced
   concrete patches in the form of macro-cells. But, whether this formation
   of macro-cell is influenced by the coupled effect of high temperature
   and high relative humidity remained a question and formed the basis of
   this research. This coupled effect is investigated by laboratory
   controlled experimentation at varying temperature at 30, 40 and 50
   degrees C and a high ambient relative humidity of 85\% in environmental
   control chambers. Specimens were prepared having total chloride
   concentration in mixing water 3\% and 5 \% by mass of binder. From the
   experiment results interesting and novel observations, trends and
   behaviors have been identified. A non-uniform and non-linear corrosion
   reaction was observed even after the breaking of passive layer.
   Furthermore, a decrease in electrochemical corrosion potential and
   corrosion mass loss at 50 degrees C in comparison to 30 and 40 degrees C
   temperature conditions was seen. This may be due to the reduction of
   oxygen solubility in the pore solution at high temperature and blockage
   of concrete pores at high relative humidity. It is expected that a
   stable oxide layer may have developed under limiting oxygen controlled
   corrosion reaction. This can form basis for the development of a new
   technique to passivate steel bar embedded in chloride contaminated
   concrete and improve the method of repairs.},

Abstract = {Air temperature influences agricultural practices and production
   outcomes, making detailed quantifications of temperature changes
   necessary for potential positive and negative effects on agricultural
   management practices to be exploited or mitigated. Temperature trends of
   long-term data for five agricultural locations, ranging from the
   subhumid eastern to the semiarid western parts of Nebraska, were studied
   to determine local temperature changes and their potential effects on
   agricultural practices. The study quantified trends in annual and
   monthly average maximum and minimum air temperature (T-max and T-min),
   daily temperature range (DTR), total growing degree-days, extreme
   temperatures, growing-season dates and lengths, and temperature
   distributions for five heavily agricultural areas of Nebraska: Alliance,
   Central City, Culbertson, Fremont, and Hastings. July and August were
   the months with the greatest decreases in T-max for the central part of
   Nebraska-Culbertson, Hastings, and Central City. Alliance, Culbertson,
   and Fremont had year-round decreases in DTR. Central City and Hastings
   experienced growing-season decreases in DTR. Increases in growing-season
   length occurred at rates of 14.3, 16.7, and 11.9 days century(-1) for
   Alliance, Central City, and Fremont, respectively. At Hastings,
   moderately earlier last spring frost (LS) at a rate of 6.6 days
   century(-1) was offset by an earlier (2.7 days century(-1)) first fall
   frost (FF), resulting in only a 3.8 days century(-1) longer growing
   season. There were only slight changes in LS and FF dates of around 2
   days earlier and 1 day later per century, respectively, for Culbertson.},

Title = {Late Cretaceous-Neogene trends in deep ocean temperature and continental
   ice volume: Reconciling records of benthic foraminiferal geochemistry
   (δ<SUP>18</SUP>O and Mg/Ca) with sea level history},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {We reconstruct trends in ice volume and deep ocean temperature for the
   past 108 Myr, resolving variations on timescales of similar to 2 Myr and
   longer. We use a sea level record as a proxy for ice volume, a benthic
   foraminiferal Mg/Ca-bf record as a proxy for temperature, and a benthic
   foraminiferal d(18)O(bf) record as a proxy for both. This allows us to
   construct dual estimates of temperature and ice volume variations for
   the interval 10-60 Ma: extracting temperature from d(18)O(bf) by using
   sea level as a proxy for ice volume to constrain the d(18)O(sw)
   component, and extracting seawater d(18)O(sw) (which reflects ice
   volume) from d(18)O(bf) by using Mg/Ca-bf to constrain the temperature
   component. Each of these approaches requires numerous assumptions, but
   the range of plausible solutions are concordant on timescales >2 Myr and
   within an uncertainty of +/- 2 degrees C temperature and +/- 0.4 parts
   per thousand delta O-18(sw). The agreement between the two approaches
   for the last 50 Myr provides empirical justification for the use of
   d(18)O(bf), Mg/Ca-bf, and sea level records as robust climate proxies.
   Our reconstructions indicate differences between deep ocean cooling and
   continental ice growth in the late Cenozoic: cooling occurred gradually
   in the middle-late Eocene and late Miocene-Pliocene while ice growth
   occurred rapidly in the earliest Oligocene, middle Miocene, and
   Plio-Pleistocene. These differences are consistent with climate models
   that imply that temperatures, set by the long-term CO2 equilibrium,
   should change only gradually on timescales >2 Myr, but growth of
   continental ice sheets may be rapid in response to climate thresholds
   due to feedbacks that are not yet fully understood.},

Title = {Temporal trends of the association between ambient temperature and
   hospitalisations for cardiovascular diseases in Queensland, Australia
   from 1995 to 2016: A time-stratified case-crossover study},
Journal = {PLOS MEDICINE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background In the context of global warming, studies have turned to
   assess the temporal trend of the association between temperature and
   health outcomes, which can be used to reflect whether human beings have
   adapted to the local temperature. However, most studies have only
   focused on hot temperature and mortality. We aim to investigate the
   temporal variations in the association between ambient temperature and
   hospitalisations for cardiovascular diseases in Queensland, Australia
   from 1995 to 2016. Methods and findings We obtained data on 1,855,717
   cardiovascular hospitalisations (mean age: 65.9 years, 42.7\% female)
   from all 443 postal areas in Queensland, Australia between January 1,
   1995 and December 31, 2016. Grid-level meteorological data were
   downloaded from scientific information for landowners. We used a
   time-stratified case-crossover design fitted with a conditional
   quasi-Poisson regression model and time-varying distributed lag
   nonlinear model (DLNM) to evaluate the association between temperature
   and cardiovascular hospitalisations and the temporal trends of the
   associations. Stratified analyses were performed in different age, sex,
   and climate zones. In all groups, relative risks (RRs) of cardiovascular
   hospitalisations associated with high temperatures (heat effects)
   increased, but cold effects showed a decreasing trend from 1995 to 2016.
   The increasing magnitude of heat effects was larger (p= 0.002) in men
   than in women and larger (p< 0.001) in people aged <= 69 years than in
   those aged >= 70 years. There was no apparent difference amongst
   different climate zones. The study was limited by the switch from ICD-9
   to ICD-10 coding systems, by being unable to separate first-time
   hospitalisation from repeated hospitalisations, and possibly by
   confounding by air pollution or by influenza infections. Conclusion The
   impacts of cold temperatures on cardiovascular hospitalisations have
   decreased, but the impacts of high temperatures have increased in
   Queensland, Australia. The findings highlight that Queensland people
   have adapted to the impacts of cold temperatures, but not high
   temperatures. The burden of cardiovascular hospitalisations due to high
   temperatures is likely to increase in the context of global warming.
   Author summaryWhy was this study done?
   Studies have reported temporal decline in the association between hot
   temperature and cardiovascular mortality, which indicates that people
   may have adapted to the warming climate. However, little is known about
   the change in the association between ambient temperature and
   cardiovascular hospitalisation in recent decades. What did the
   researchers do and find?
   Using 1.9 million cardiovascular hospitalisations during 1995-2016 in
   Queensland, Australia, we developed a model to evaluate the association
   between temperature and cardiovascular hospitalisations and their trend
   over time. We found that the impact of cold temperature on
   cardiovascular hospitalisation decreased, but the impact of high
   temperature on cardiovascular hospitalisations increased from 1995 to
   2016. The results were robust amongst different subgroups. The
   increasing heat effect was more serious for men than women and for
   people <= 69 years than people >= 70 years. What do these findings mean?
   Given the increased associations between hot temperature and
   cardiovascular hospitalisation, the acceleration of global warming, and
   an aging population, we highlight a worrying trend that the burden of
   cardiovascular healthcare facilities is to increase over time on
   high-temperature days. Heat warning systems should focus more on men and
   people <= 69 years old, since heat effects on these groups increased
   more noticeably than for women and people >= 70 years old, respectively.},

Abstract = {Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) monthly time series were
   investigated for last 150 years by implementation of a comprehensive
   smoothing technique controlled by cross-validation procedure, which
   provided more statistically significant trend evaluation than moving
   average or linear trend techniques. It was found that there is a winter
   sea surface temperature (SST) oscillation of around the 64-69 year scale
   behind a known SST fluctuation of decadal scale for winter months. The
   AMO trend demonstrates waters wan-ning in the first part of 20th
   century, cooling period in 50th and 60th, and warming in 80th-90th
   years. This result confirms the global ocean conveyer theory of Broker.
   Weak AMO linear trend respond to the greenhouse warming effect related
   to carbon dioxide concentration increasing. It demonstrates a slow
   warming behind a more strong (in amplitude) oscillation responded to
   still not well understood world ocean properties. This result was
   confirmed by independent research based on wavelet analysis of the same
   time series. The ice extent (IE) smoothed curve in Barents and Kara Seas
   shows a coherent behavior: two minimums (in 20th-30th and in 80th-90th)
   and one maximum in the middle of 20th century. Coherency of the
   AMO/NAO/IE trends, on one hand, and SLP/SAT trends, on other hand,
   proved a close relationship existed in various modules of the climate
   system (atmosphere-ocean-glacial cover) in the Northern Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {Taking the Guanzhong Plain of China as the research area, a method
   combining the trend surface analysis (TSA) method and the spatial
   variation weight method (SVWM) was used to upscale the vegetation
   temperature condition index (VTCI) retrieved from Landsat 8 from a finer
   spatial resolution to a coarser. The upscaled results were compared with
   VTCIs retrieved from Aqua MODIS to provide technical support for the
   comprehensive application of drought monitoring results on two spatial
   scales. Meanwhile, the upscaled methods were systematically evaluated in
   a case study according to various indicators, including the spatial
   distribution characteristics for drought, the statistical
   characteristics, the semivariogram function (SVF), the structural
   similarity (SSIM), the correlation coefficient (r), and the root mean
   square error (RMSE). The results show that the dominant class
   variability weighted (DCVW) method performed better than did the
   arithmetic average variability weighted (AAVW) and median pixel
   variability weighted (MPVW) methods in terms of the statistical
   characteristics, SSIM, correlation and RMSE, and the upscaling model
   based on the union of TSA and DCVW had the highest accuracy. The DCVW is
   a promising tool for upscaling Landsat-VTCI images of the Guanzhong
   Plain from finer to coarser spatial resolutions because of its
   efficiency and flexibility.},

Title = {Downscaling MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product Using an Adaptive
   Random Forest Regression Method and Google Earth Engine for a 19-Years
   Spatiotemporal Trend Analysis Over Iran},

Pages = {2103-2112},
Abstract = {MODIS land surface temperature (LST) product (MOD11A1) has been widely
   used in analysing spatiotemporal trends of LST. However, its
   applicability is limited, partially due to its coarse spatial resolution
   (i.e., 1 km). In this study, an Adaptive random forest regression (ARFR)
   method was developed for LST downscaling at national scale. This study
   also provided a framework to shift from downscaling single-time image
   sets to extensive time-series of MOD11A1 LST images in an operational
   approach (i.e., a 19-years spatiotemporal LST trend analysis over Iran)
   using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The
   performance of ARFR was assessed by comparing the results of the
   downscaled LSTs with the Landsat-8 LST data on different dates of six
   consecutive years (2014-2019) over ten different sub-areas in Iran. The
   results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method with an
   average root mean square error and mean absolute error of 2.22 degrees C
   and 1.59 degrees C, respectively. The results of spatiotemporal LST
   trend analysis showed that 25.08\%, 10.05\%, 56.68\%, 1.04\%, and
   32.84\% of Iran experienced significant positive trends during a full
   year, spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. Significant
   negative trends were also observed over the 3.09\%, 23.84\%, 7.54\%,
   17.38\%, and 18.77\% of Iran during a full year, spring, summer, fall,
   and winter, respectively. In summary, the outcomes of this study not
   only exhibit the spatiotemporal trends of LST across Iran, but also
   reveal the substantial benefits of the ARFR method in downscaling LST
   using GEE.},

Title = {Comparison of seasonal surface temperature trend, spatial variability,

Abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) and near-surface air temperature products
   have been commonly used in the studies of global climate change. In this
   work, we compare satellite-observed LST from Advanced Along-Track
   Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and surface skin temperature and 2m air
   temperature (T2) simulated from High Asian Refined analysis (HAR) to
   provide an independent overview of the surface/air temperature trend
   over Tibetan Plateau (TP) region in 2003-2011. We investigate the
   seasonal trend, spatial variability, and the elevation dependency of LST
   and air temperature over TP for the last decade. Linear regression
   method is applied to all data sets to illustrate the warming and cooling
   trends and variability of temperature over the study area. Our analysis
   shows that an overall warming slope is 0.04Kyear(-1) in the day trend
   and 0.05Kyear(-1) in the night and the trend slope is stronger in the
   simulated HAR data sets than that in the AATSR LST, especially for the
   night air temperature. However, in regions with elevation above 4000m,
   the proportion of areas with the warming trend is less than 50\% except
   in autumn from HAR data sets. The Namco and Qomolangma sites show an
   apparent trend of warming and cooling, respectively. The results from
   both satellite observations and numerical outputs show that warming
   trend over the entire TP was not obvious during last decade and the
   cooling trend was even found in the northeast TP.},

Title = {Evaluating land use/cover change associations with urban surface
   temperature <i>via</i> machine learning and spatial modeling: Past
   trends and future simulations in Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {While urbanization puts lots of pressure on green areas, the transition
   of green-to-grey surfaces under land use land cover change is directly
   related to increased land surface temperature-compromising livability
   and comfort in cities due to the heat island effect. In this context, we
   evaluate historical and future associations between land use land cover
   changes and land surface temperature in Dera Ghazi Khan-one of the top
   cities in Pakistan-using multi-temporal Landsat data over two decades
   (2002-2022). After assessing current land use changes and future
   predictions, their impact on land surface temperature and urban heat
   island effect is measured using machine learning via Multi-Layer
   Perceptron-Markov Chain, Artificial Neural Network and Cellular
   Automata. Significant changes in land use land cover were observed in
   the last two decades. The built-up area expanded greatly (874ha) while
   agriculture land (-687ha) and barren land (-253ha) show decreasing
   trend. The water bodies were found the lowest changes (57ha) and
   vegetation cover got the largest proportion in all the years. This
   green-grey conversion in the last two decades (8.7\%) and prospect along
   the main corridors show the gravity of unplanned urban growth at the
   cost of vegetation and agricultural land (-6.8\%). The land surface
   temperature and urban heat island effect shows a strong positive
   correlation between urbanization and vegetation removal. The simulation
   results presented in this study confirm that by 2032, the city will face
   a 5 degrees C high mean temperature based on historical patterns, which
   could potentially lead to more challenges associated with urban heat
   island if no appropriate measures are taken. It is expected that due to
   land cover changes by 2032, similar to 60\% of urban and peri-urban
   areas will experience very hot to hot temperatures (> 31.5 degrees C).
   Our results provide baseline information to urban managers and planners
   to understand the increasing trends of land surface temperature in
   response to land cover changes. The study is important for urban
   resource management, sustainable development policies, and actions to
   mitigate the heat island effect. It will further asset the broader
   audience to understand the impact of land use land cover changes on the
   land surface temperature and urban heat island effect in the light of
   historic pattern and machine learning approach.},

Title = {Satellite-Based Discrimination of Urban Dynamics-Induced Local Bias from
   Day/Night Temperature Trends across the Nile Delta, Egypt: A Basis for
   Climate Change Impacts Assessment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {The Nile Delta is the most vital region of the desert-dominated country
   of Egypt. Due to its prominent level of vulnerability to climate
   change's negative impacts and its low capacity for adaptation and
   mitigation, the current study aims to provide accurate quantification of
   temperature change across the Nile Delta as an integral basis for
   sustainability and climate change impacts assessment studies. This was
   achieved through monitoring urban dynamics and detecting LST trends in
   91 cities and their rural surroundings. The relevant local urban bias
   was discriminated from regional/background changes present in
   diurnal/nocturnal temperature records. The temperature records were then
   corrected/adjusted by removing this urban bias. Owing to the
   insufficiency of ground-based meteorological observatories, the
   investigation utilized moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) land surface temperatures (LSTs) and Landsat-based datasets
   (2000-2021). The widely used Mann-Kendall test (MKT) and Theil-Sen
   estimator (TSE) were employed to assess trends in urban sprawl, LST time
   series, and the implied association. The analysis revealed that the
   region has experienced dramatic urbanization, where the total urban
   expansion was greater than two-thirds (69.1\%) of the original urban
   area in 2000. This was accompanied by a notable warming trend in the
   day/night and urban/rural LST records. The nocturnal LST exhibited a
   warming tendency (0.072 degrees C year(-1)) larger than the diurnal
   equivalent (0.065 degrees C year(-1)). The urban dynamics were
   positively correlated with LST trends, whereas the Mediterranean Sea
   appeared as a significant anti-urbanization moderator, in addition to
   the Nile River and the prevailing northerly/northwesterly winds. The
   urban-rural comparison approach disclosed that the urbanization process
   caused a warming bias in the nighttime LST trend by 0.017 degrees C
   year(-1) (21.8\%) and a cooling bias in the daytime by -0.002 degrees C
   year(-1) (4.4\%). All results were statistically significant at a
   confidence level of 99\%. It is recommended that studies of
   climate-related sustainability and climate change impact assessment in
   the Nile Delta should apply a distinction of urban-induced local effect
   when quantifying the actual regional temperature change.},

Title = {Ground-based observations of Saturn's auroral ionosphere over three
   days: Trends in HI temperature, density and emission with Saturn local
   time and planetary period oscillation},
Journal = {ICARUS},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {On 19-21 April 2013, the ground-based 10-m W.M. Keck II telescope was
   used to simultaneously measure HI emissions from four regions of
   Saturn's auroral ionosphere: (1) the northern noon region of the main
   auroral oval; (2) the northern midnight main oval; (3) the northern
   polar cap and (4) the southern noon main oval. The H-3(+) emission from
   these regions was captured in the form of high resolution spectral
   images as the planet rotated. The results herein contain twenty-three
   H-3(+) temperatures, column densities and total emissions located in the
   aforementioned regions - ninety-two data points in total, spread over
   timescales of both hours and days. Thermospheric temperatures in the
   spring-time northern main oval are found to be cooler than their
   autumn-time southern counterparts by tens of K, consistent with the
   hypothesis that the total thermospheric heating rate is inversely
   proportional to magnetic field strength. The main oval H-3(+) density
   and emission is lower at northern midnight than it is at noon, in
   agreement with a nearby peak in the electron influx in the post-dawn
   sector and a minimum flux at midnight. Finally, when arranging the
   northern main oval H-3(+) parameters as a function of the oscillation
   period seen in Saturn's magnetic field the planetary period oscillation
   (PPO) phase - we see a large peak in H-3(+) density and emission at
   similar to 115 degrees northern phase, with a full-width at half-maximum
   (FWHM) of similar to 44 degrees. This seems to indicate that the influx
   of electrons associated with the PPO phase at 90 is responsible at least
   in part for the behavior of all H(3)(+)parameters. A combination of the
   H-3(+) production and loss timescales and the 10 uncertainty in the
   location of a given PPO phase are likely, at least in part, to be
   responsible for the observed peaks in H-3(+) density and emission
   occurring at a later time than the peak precipitation expected at 90 PPO
   phase. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   and dispersity by GPC, the glass transition temperature by DSC, the
   change in the mass by decomposition using TGA, the degree of
   crystallinity by X-ray diffractions, and the morphological features by
   SEM. The change in the lower critical solution temperature and the phase
   separation of polymers solutions were measured by turbidity test as the
   change in transmittance with temperature with concerning the change in
   pH and using UV-VIS spectroscopy. The new cationic thermo-pH responsive

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2005},

Abstract = {Long-term climate trends of surface air temperature should not be
   expected to have the same trends for light wind and stronger wind
   nights, even if the trends in the boundary layer heat fluxes were the
   same. Parker ( 2004) segmented observed surface temperature data into
   lighter and stronger wind terciles in order to assess whether the
   reported large-scale global-averaged temperature increases are
   attributable to urban warming. We conclude, however, that trends at an
   individual height depend on wind speed, thermodynamic stability,
   aerodynamic roughness, and the vertical gradient of absolute humidity.
   We present an analysis to illustrate why temperature values at specific
   levels will depend on wind speed, and with the same boundary layer heat
   content change, trends in temperature should be expected to be different
   at every height near the surface when the winds are light, as well as
   different between light wind and stronger wind nights. This introduces a
   complexity into the assessment of long-term surface temperature trends
   that has not been previously recognized.},

Abstract = {A study of radiosonde observations for temperature at 850 hPa over Delhi
   for a period of 35 years was conducted. The influence of atmospheric
   oscillations and geophysical events like El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) on tropospheric temperature variability showed indicative trends
   for changing urban climate in Delhi. The inter-annual variation in
   surface temperature and its relationship with land use changes and land
   cover changes (LULCC) was also examined. LULCC and urban expansion into
   peripheral areas of Delhi (towards the West, North, North-West and
   South) at the cost of agricultural and wasteland was found to be
   extensive. The upper range of the surface temperature has shifted by
   similar to 6 degrees C. The post-monsoon and winter months from November
   to February have experienced a considerable increase in the average
   temperature in the period examined. The monsoon months from June to
   September have undergone cooling of similar to 0.5 degrees C-1 degrees C
   at 850 hPa. An inverse relationship exists between the Southern
   Oscillation Index (SOI) and the monthly averaged temperature. The
   temperature of the atmosphere over Delhi at 850 hPa has increased only
   marginally (similar to 0.3 degrees C) for the time period 1980-2015.

Title = {Associations of diurnal temperature range change with the leading
   climate variability modes during the Northern Hemisphere wintertime and
   their implication on the detection of regional climate trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This study examines associations of diurnal temperature range (DTR)
   changes in observations at the global, hemispheric, subcontinental, and
   grid box scales with five leading climate variability modes, including
   the Arctic Oscillation (AO), hemispheric Pacific-North America
   (PNA)-like mode, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO), and Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) during the Northern
   Hemisphere winter season (Jan-Mar). Winter DTR variability in most
   subcontinental regions is significantly related to variations in either
   the AO, or hemispheric PNA-like mode, or ENSO index in the Northern
   Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the DTR variability appears
   closely coupled with variations in the ENSO and AAO. From 1951 to 2000,
   variations in the circulation patterns account for a significant
   fraction of the DTR increase at all scales although the strength of
   these associations varies geographically. After removing the linearly
   congruent component of leading climate variability modes from the total
   wintertime DTR trends in the observations, statistically significant
   residual trends in DTR are still found at the global, hemispheric, and
   most subcontinental regions. Ensemble mean multimodel averaged DTR
   trends to major anthropogenic and natural forcing are significantly
   smaller than not only observed total DTR trends but also residual trends
   at these large scales. The implication of changes in the leading climate
   variability modes on the detection of regional DTR trends is discussed.
   We find that the detection of the regional response to combined
   anthropogenic and natural forcing is robust to the exclusion of trends
   related to changes of the five modes considered here.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Temperature is a fundamentally important driver of ecosystem processes
   in streams. Recent warming of terrestrial climates around the globe has
   motivated concern about consequent increases in stream temperature. More
   specifically, observed trends of increasing air temperature and
   declining stream flow are widely believed to result in corresponding
   increases in stream temperature. Here, we examined the evidence for this
   using long-term stream temperature data from minimally and highly
   human-impacted sites located across the Pacific continental United
   States. Based on hypothesized climate impacts, we predicted that we
   should find warming trends in the maximum, mean and minimum
   temperatures, as well as increasing variability over time. These
   predictions were not fully realized. Warming trends were most prevalent
   in a small subset of locations with longer time series beginning in the
   1950s. More recent series of observations (1987-2009) exhibited fewer
   warming trends and more cooling trends in both minimally and highly
   human-influenced systems. Trends in variability were much less evident,
   regardless of the length of time series. Based on these findings, we
   conclude that our perspective of climate impacts on stream temperatures
   is clouded considerably by a lack of long-term data on minimally
   impacted streams, and biased spatio-temporal representation of existing
   time series. Overall our results highlight the need to develop more
   mechanistic, process-based understanding of linkages between climate
   change, other human impacts and stream temperature, and to deploy sensor
   networks that will provide better information on trends in stream
   temperatures in the future. Citation: Arismendi, I., S. L. Johnson, J.

Title = {Spatial Characteristics and Temporal Trend of Urban Heat Island Effect
   over Major Cities in India Using Long-Term Space-Based MODIS Land
   Surface Temperature Observations (2000-2023)},

Abstract = {The alteration of the Earth's surface due to urbanization and the
   formation of urban heat islands is one of the most evident and widely
   discussed anthropogenic impacts on Earth's microclimate. The elevated
   land surface temperature in the urban perimeter compared with the
   surrounding non-urban area is known as the surface urban heat island
   (SUHI) effect. India has experienced swift urban growth over the past
   few decades, and this trend is expected to persist in years to come. The
   literature published on SUHI in India focuses only on a few specific
   cities, and there is limited understanding of its geospatial variation
   across a broader region and its long-term trend. Here, we present one of
   the first studies exploring the long-term diurnal (daytime, and
   nighttime), seasonal, and annual characteristics of SUHI in the 20
   largest urban centers of India and its neighboring countries. The study
   highlights a statistically significant (95\% confidence interval) rise
   in nighttime surface temperatures across major cities based on a linear
   fit over 23 years (2000-2023) of MODIS land surface temperature
   satellite observations. The nighttime SUHI was found to be more
   conspicuous, positive, and consistent when compared with daytime
   satellite observations. The nighttime SUHI for April-May-June
   representing the pre-monsoon and onset of monsoon months for the top 10
   cities, ranged from 0.92 to 2.33 degrees C; for
   December-January-February, representing the winter season, it ranged
   from 1.38 to 2.63 degrees C. In general, the total change in the
   nighttime SUHI based on linear fit (2000-2023) for the top ten cities
   showed warming over the urban region ranging from 2.04 to 3.7 degrees C.
   The highest warming trend was observed during the months of
   May-June-July (3.7 and 3.01 degrees C) in Ahmedabad and Delhi, cities
   that have undergone rapid urbanization in the last two to three decades.
   The study identified strongly positive annual SUHI intensity during
   nighttime, and weakly negative to moderately positive annual SUHI
   intensity during daytime, for major cities. Jaipur (India), Lahore
   (Pakistan), Dhaka (Bangladesh), and Colombo (Sri Lanka) showed a
   nighttime SUHI intensity of 2.17, 2.33, 0.32, and 0.21 degrees C,
   respectively, during the months of April-May-June, and a nighttime SUHI
   intensity of 2.63, 1.68, 0.94, 0.33 degrees C, respectively, for the
   months of December-January-February (2000-2023). It is apparent that the
   geographical location (inland/coastal) of the city has a high influence
   on the daytime and nighttime SUHI patterns. The current research is
   intended to help city planners and policymakers better understand SUHI
   intensity (day and night/seasonal basis) for developing strategies to
   mitigate urban heat island effects.},

Abstract = {We present diverging long-term trends in the water temperature of a
   large boreal lake, Lake Pyhaselka (263 km(2)), located in eastern
   Finland. The dataset was constructed from a half century of monitoring
   (1962-2010). The direction of the temperature trend depended on the
   water layer and the season, in that the yearly average temperature in
   the top layer (1-10 m) as recorded in summer (June-August) increased by
   2.5 degrees C over the monitoring period, whereas that recorded when the
   lake was covered by ice (January-April) decreased from 0.6 to 0.2
   degrees C. The water temperature in the bottommost layers showed no
   trends. We suggest that the water temperature under the ice is
   decreasing in this case as a consequence of mixed effects of
   lake-specific physical features and climate change, which cause
   variations in the heat content of the inflowing water of the Pielisjoki.
   The epilimnetic water temperature in summer appeared in turn to follow
   general trends in air temperatures. Our results stress the need for
   taking local and site-specific phenomena into account when drawing
   conclusions about the effects of climate change on lakes.},

Title = {Reconstruction of a 253-year long mast record of European beech reveals
   its association with large scale temperature variability and no
   long-term trend in mast frequencies},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Synchronous production of large seed crops, or mast years (MYs), is a
   common feature of many Fagus species, which is closely linked to the
   dynamics of forest ecosystems, including regeneration of canopy trees
   and changes in animal population densities. To better understand its
   climatic controls and check for the presence of long-term temporal
   trends in MY frequencies, we reconstructed MY record of the European
   beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) for the southern Swedish province of Halland
   over 1753-2006. We used superimposed epoch analysis (SEA) to relate MY
   (a) to summer temperature fields over the European subcontinent and (b)
   to the patterns of 500 mb geopotential heights over the 35-75 degrees N.
   For the MY reconstruction, we used newly developed regional beech
   ring-width chronology (1753-2006), an available summer temperature
   reconstruction, and a discontinuous historical MY record. A Monte Carlo
   experiment allowed identification of the thresholds in both growth and
   summer temperature anomalies, indicative of historical MYs, which were
   verified by dividing data into temporally independent calibration and
   verification sub-periods.
   MYs were strongly associated with both the 500 mb height anomalies and
   average summer temperatures during two years preceding a MY: a mast year
   (t) followed a cold summer two years (t-2) prior to the mast year and a
   warm summer one year prior (t-1) to the mast year. During t-2 years, the
   geographical pattern of 500 mb height anomalies exhibited a strong
   height depression in the region centered in the Northern Sea and
   extending toward eastern North America and statistically significant
   (p<0.05) temperature anomalies covering predominantly southern
   Scandinavia (area below 60 N) and British Isles. A year immediately
   preceding a mast year (t-1) was characterized by a strong regional high
   pressure anomaly centered in southern Scandinavia with significant
   temperature anomalies extended mostly over southern Scandinavia and
   Germany.
   The long-term mean MY return interval was 6.3 years, with 50 and 90\%
   probabilities of MY occurrence corresponding to 6 and 15 years,
   respectively. Periods with intervals significantly shorter than the
   long-term mean were observed around 1820-1860 and 1990-2006 (means 3.9
   and 3.2 years, respectively). However, the difference in return
   intervals between two sub-periods themselves was not significant.
   Geographically large and temporally rapid changes in atmospheric
   circulation among years, responsible for summer temperature conditions
   in the Northern Europe, are likely primary environmental drivers of
   masting phenomenon. However, decadal and centurial variability in MY
   intervals is difficult to relate directly to temperature variability,
   suggesting the presence of conditions ``canceling{''} would-be MYs.
   Long-term MY reconstruction demonstrates high variability of
   reproductive behavior in European beech and indicates that a period with
   shorter MY intervals at the end of 20th may be not unique in a
   multi-century perspective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Spatial Variability in Years of Abrupt Seasonal Temperature Changes and
   Warming (Cooling) Hiatuses in China from 1951-2018 and the Variation
   Trends before and after These Years},

Abstract = {Abrupt temperature changes and warming (cooling) hiatuses have an impact
   on the ecological environment. Currently, research findings for the
   spatial variability in the years of abrupt temperature changes and
   warming (cooling) hiatuses covering a variety of climate zones, as well
   as the variation trends before and after these years, are lacking. In
   the present study, based on the seasonal (monthly) average minimum
   temperatures, average temperatures, and average maximum temperature data
   from 622 Chinese meteorological stations during 1951-2018, the spatial
   variability in the years of abrupt seasonal changes and warming
   (cooling) hiatuses for these three temperature types in China, as well
   as the variation trends before and after these years, were analyzed
   using the Mann-Kendall test. The results are as follows. For most
   stations in China, the abrupt changes in the three temperature types
   during each season began to occur over a wide range in the late 1980s
   and early 1990s, and abrupt changes did not occur at a few stations
   concentrated south of 30 degrees N. After an abrupt change occurred, the
   average minimum temperatures and average temperatures both showed
   significant upward trends, while the average maximum temperatures showed
   significant downward trends in some regions of southern China. After
   five to 15 years of temperature increases (decreases) following the
   abrupt changes, warming (cooling) hiatuses occurred in some areas of
   China, with the hiatus years occurring between 1989 and 2013. These
   hiatuses mainly occurred in 1998 and 2007, and in terms of proximity,
   the stations without warming (cooling) hiatuses were concentrated south
   of 40 degrees N. After nine to 17 years of warming (cooling) hiatuses,
   the hiatuses ended at some stations between 2013 and 2017, after which
   the temperatures again increased rapidly. The periods of warming
   (cooling) hiatuses were longer in northern China than in southern China.
   Currently, there are some stations where the hiatuses have not ended,
   suggesting that the hiatus period is apparently longer than 17 years.
   The years of abrupt change, no abrupt change, hiatus, no hiatus, end of
   hiatus, and no end of hiatus, as well as their variation trends before
   and after these years, have shown strong spatial variability. The
   results of this study have enriched the research findings on climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Quick population increase and the desire for urbanization are the main
   drivers for accelerating urban expansion on agricultural lands in Egypt.
   This issue is obvious in governorates with no desert backyards. This
   study aims to (1) explore the trend of Land Use Land Cover Change
   (LULCC) through the period of 1991-2018; (2) upgrade the reliability of
   predicting LULCC by integrating the Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov chain
   and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP); and (3) perform analysis
   of urbanization risk on LST trends over the Gharbia governorate for the
   decision makers to implement effective strategies for sustainable land
   use. Multi-temporal Landsat images were used to monitor LULCC dynamics
   from 1991 to 2018 and then simulate LULCC in 2033 and 2048. Two
   comparable models were adopted for the simulation of spatiotemporal
   dynamics of land use in the study area: CA-Markov chain and
   FAHP-CA-Markov chain hybrid models. The second model upgrades the
   potential of the CA-Markov chain for prediction by its integration with
   FAHP, which can determine the locations of high potential to be
   urbanized. The outcomes stated a significant LULCC in Gharbia during the
   study period-specifically, urban sprawl on agricultural land, and this
   trend is predicted to carry on. The agricultural sector represented
   91.2\% in 1991 and reduced to 83.7\% in 2018. The built-up area is
   almost doubled by 2048 with respect to 2018. The regression analysis
   revealed the LST increase due to urbanization, causing an urban heat
   island phenomenon. Criteria-based analysis reveals the district's
   vulnerability to rapid urbanization, which is efficient for data-gap
   zones. The simulation results make sense since the FAHP-CA-Markov
   simulated the LULCC in a thoughtful way, considering the driving forces
   of LULCC, while the CA-Markov chain results were relatively random.
   Therefore, the FAHP-CA-Markov chain is the pioneer to be relied upon for
   future projection. The findings of this work provide a better
   understanding of LULCC trends over the years supporting decision makers
   toward sustainable land use. Thus, further urbanization should be
   planned to avert the loss of agricultural land and uninterrupted
   increasing temperatures.},

Abstract = {As the temperature and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) influence our
   life in many fields like agriculture and health, changes in either
   parameter may affect our current and future plans in such areas. This
   paper investigates the variability of temperature and DTR in the Levant
   and the Arabian Peninsula (172 stations in 12 countries) in different
   study periods of 10, 25, 40, 50, and 60years. The data were tested for
   homogeneity using four standard tests, and we used the nonparametric
   statistics Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen to calculate trend significance,
   direction, and magnitude in time series. Our results show a significant
   warming trend in 45-60\% of the region with an average increase of 0.65,
   0.43, and 0.30 degrees C/decade for the 25-, 40-, and 50-year study
   periods. The highest number of stations that have a significant increase
   in temperature occurs in spring and summer. On the other hand,
   decreasing DTR trends occur in about 31\% of the region, mostly in the
   south of the Arabian Peninsula at 0.60 degrees C/decade. This work,
   additionally, provides an interactive online tool that shows the trends
   and temperature on zoomable maps, charts, and other visuals to station
   level. This tool could benefit researchers and strategic planners for
   the studied region. In many stations, we found that there are a
   significant increase in temperature and a decrease in DTR which reflect
   a severe change in the climate that should be considered in future
   planning. We recommend expanding this study to cover precipitation and
   other meteorological factors.},

Abstract = {In order to study the rapid temperature descent observed from the end of
   spring until autumn in Uragami Bay along the east coast of the Kii
   Peninsula, daily surface temperature data was taken during the four
   seasons in 1983-86 near the fish cultivation ground. These figures,
   along with temperature measurements from each level of the fish
   cultivation construction, were then analyzed. Possible effects of this
   rapid temperature descent on the feeding of young cultured yellowtail
   Seriola quinqueradiata (Temminck et Schlegel) were also discussed. The
   rapid temperature descent during the season of overall warming trends
   which occurs around the Kii Penninsula is caused by coastal upwellings
   and results in the cold water intrusion of the bottom layer. We have
   made it clear that the change influences the feeding amount of cultured
   yellowtail.},

Abstract = {Based on the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope method, this study
   investigates the monthly, seasonal, and annual sea surface temperature
   (SST) trends in the coastal area of Hai Phong (West of Tonkin Gulf)
   based on the measurements at Hon Dau Station from 1995 to 2020. The
   results show a sea surface warming trend of 0.02 degrees C/year for the
   period 1995-2020 (significant level alpha = 0.1) and of 0.093 degrees
   C/year for the period 2008-2020 (significant level alpha = 0.05). The
   monthly SSTs in June and September increased by 0.027 degrees C/year and
   0.036 degrees C/year, respectively, for the period 1995-2020, and by
   0.080 degrees C/year and 0.047 degrees C/year, respectively, for the
   period 2008-2020. SST trends in winter, summer, and other months were
   either different for the two periods or not significant enough. This may
   be due to the impact of ENSO, which caused interannual SST variability
   in the Hai Phong coastal with two intrinsic mode functions (IMF) signals
   a period of similar to 2 (IMF3) and similar to 5.2 years cycle (IMF4). A
   combination of these signals had a maximum correlation of 0.22 with ONI
   (Oceanic Nino Index) delayed by 8 months. ENSO events took similar to 8
   months to affect SST at Hai Phong coastal area for 1995-2020 and caused
   a variation of SST within 1.2 degrees C.},

Title = {Variation in Temperature, Change in Barometric Pressure, and Salinity
   Explain Trends in the Acoustic Backscatter of Fishes Within a Large Ship

Abstract = {Human-fortified ship channel inlets can represent the only connection
   between estuarine and coastal waters for tens of kilometers in some
   areas of the Northern Gulf of Mexico, making them bottlenecks for fish
   movement. A variety of fishes associate with the jetties that fortify
   ship channel inlets, and the deep depths of channel inlets relative to
   surrounding waters may provide a unique type of habitat. To understand
   variability in fish biomass in these vital areas, 49 hydroacoustic
   surveys of the Aransas Channel Inlet, Texas were conducted and paired
   with environmental (e.g., temperature) and meteorological (e.g.,
   barometric pressure) data between January 2018 and February 2020.
   Fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data from the surrounding area
   were employed to provide context to variability in fish backscatter
   (i.e., volume backscattering strength, s(v), a proxy for fish biomass).
   Generalized additive models indicated that variation in fish backscatter
   was best explained by variation in temperature, change in barometric
   pressure, and salinity (adj.-R-2 = 0.71). There were two dimensions to
   these effects. In the first, variation in temperature tracked seasonal
   shifts in the relative abundance of pelagic fishes, which were well
   sampled by acoustic technologies relative to demersal fishes. In the
   second, episodic cold fronts (i.e., high pressure systems) were
   associated with high values of fish backscatter - likely because the
   Aransas Channel Inlet is far deeper than surrounding areas and protected
   by jetties, making it less affected by physical disturbances and rapidly
   changing air temperatures or precipitation. Thus, disturbances in the
   Aransas Channel Inlet (e.g., dredging and construction, shipping
   traffic) are likely to be most impactful to non-demersal fishes when
   temperature and salinity are low (< c.a. 15 degrees C and < c.a. 28 psu)
   and frontal systems are likely to affect the area (barometric pressure
   increase > c.a. 3 mb or decrease > 7 mb over 24 h).},

Abstract = {To optimize the phase separation temperature of poly
   (N-isopropylacrylamide) two monomers have been used to fabricate a
   series of three functional and thermo-pH terpolymers.
   N-(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)acrylamide (DMAEAm) acts as a hydrophilic and
   pH-responsive monomer and 4-formyl-2-methoxyphenylacrylate or vanillin
   acrylate (VA) as hydrophobic and functional monomer both monomers have
   been synthesized in a one-step reaction. They were investigated by 1H,
   13C NMR, and FTIR and demonstrated good agreement with their chemical
   structures. Dual responsive functional terpolymers have been fabricated
   in different molar ratios of (DMAEAm) (10, 15, and 20 mol\%) with 10
   mol\% of VA; they have been investigated by chemical methods such as 1H,
   and FTIR as well. The physical characterization has also been achieved
   using GPC for molecular weight and molecular weight distributions, DSC
   for glass transition temperature. The vital point is studying the phase
   separation temperature or the lower critical solution temperature of the
   polymer solution, and the relative influence of DMAEAm and VA on
   transition temperature T-c of terpolymer solution; it has been recorded
   by turbidity test using UV-Vis-spectroscopy as the change of
   transmittance with temperature, on the other hand using micro-DSC of the
   polymer solution was tested. This optimization in the poly (NIPAAm)
   characterization encourages the application of the new terpolymer as a
   biosensor.

Abstract = {BackgroundEnvironmental factors greatly impact infectious
   disease-related mortality, yet there's a lack of comprehensive global
   studies on the contemporary burden and trends. This study aims to
   evaluate the global burden and trends of infectious disease mortality
   caused by air pollution, unsafe water, poor sanitation, and non-optimal
   temperature across Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) regions from 1990 to
   2019.MethodsThis observational study utilized data from the Global
   Burden of Diseases Study to examine mortality rates from infectious
   diseases attributed to environmental risk factors between 1990 and 2019,
   including air pollution, unsafe water, sanitation, handwashing
   facilities (UWSH), and non-optimal temperatures. Age-standardized
   mortality rates (ASMRs) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC)
   were utilized to present infectious disease mortality, and its
   trajectory influenced by environmental risk factors over the years.
   Nonlinear regression was conducted to explore the association between
   the SDI and ASMRs across regions from 1990 to 2019.ResultsIn 2019,
   global infectious disease deaths linked to air pollution, UWSH, and
   non-optimal temperature reached a startling 2,556,992. Disease mortality
   varied widely across SDI regions, with the highest number of deaths due
   to air pollution and UWSH in Low SDI regions, and deaths from
   non-optimal temperature primarily in High SDI regions. Age disparities
   emerged, with children under five and the elderly most affected.
   However, an increasing mortality trend was observed among seniors
   (65-69, 75-79, and over 80) in High SDI regions due to enteric
   infections linked to UWSH. Globally, a consistent decrease in ASMR was
   seen from 1990 to 2019 for all diseases connected to these factors,
   except for respiratory infections linked to non-optimal
   temperature.ConclusionsOur study underscores the significant impact of
   air pollution, UWSH, and non-optimal temperatures on global infectious
   disease mortality, particularly among vulnerable groups such as children
   and the elderly. It's important to tackle these challenges with targeted
   interventions aiming to enhance environmental quality, improve water and
   sanitation systems, and control extreme temperatures. In addition,
   international cooperation is essential for bridging regional disparities
   and driving global public health initiatives forward, thereby helping
   achieve Sustainable Development Goals more effectively.},

Abstract = {Background: Evidence is inefficient about how meteorological factors
   influence the trends of influenza transmission in different regions of
   China. Methods: We estimated the time-varying reproduction number (Rt)
   of influenza and explored the impact of temperature and relative
   humidity on Rt using generalized additive quasi-Poisson regression
   models combined with the distribution lag non-linear model (DLNM). The
   effect of temperature and humidity interaction on Rt of influenza was
   explored. The multiple random-meta analysis was used to evaluate
   region-specific association. The excess risk (ER) index was defined to
   investigate the correlation between Rt and each meteorological factor
   with the modification of seasonal and regional characteristics. Results:
   Low temperature and low relative humidity contributed to influenza
   epidemics on the national level, while shapes of merged cumulative
   effect plots were different across regions. Compared to that of median
   temperature, the merged RR (95\%CI) of low temperature in northern and
   southern regions were 1.40(1.24,1.45) and 1.20 (1.14,1.27),
   respectively, while those of high temperature were 1.10(1.03,1.17) and
   1.00 (0.95,1.04), respectively. There were negative interactions between
   temperature and relative humidity on national (SI = 0.59, 95\%CI:
   0.57-0.61), southern (SI = 0.49, 95\%CI: 0.17-0.80), and northern
   regions (SI = 0.59, 95\%CI: 0.56,0.62). In general, with the increase of
   the change of the two meteorological factors, the ER of Rt also
   gradually increased. Conclusions: Temperature and relative humidity have
   an effect on the influenza epidemics in China, and there is an
   interaction between the two meteorological factors, but the effect of
   each factor is heterogeneous among regions. Meteorological factors may
   be considered to predict the trend of influenza epidemic. \& COPY; 2023

Abstract = {Objective. According to the American Thoracic Society, approximately 5\%
   of all asthmatics have refractory asthma (RA); these patients fail to
   recover lost lung function even after long-term treatment with high
   doses of medications. Methods. Using a time-trend controlled
   case-crossover study design, we calculated odds ratios to evaluate
   whether exposure to ambient air pollutants and certain meteorological
   conditions on the day of admission (Lag 0) and up to 3 days before
   admission (Lag1 through Lag 3) were associated with acute RA
   exacerbation. Results were obtained after controlling for the effects of
   seasonality, smoking, and allergen sensitivity; we stratified our data
   into four seasons with respect to the median temperature of each month
   and further stratified them according to self-reported smoking status
   and skin-prick test results. Results. In our study, RA patients (n =
   82), living in metropolitan city of Seoul and Kyunggi Province,
   accounted for 3.7\% of all asthmatics (n = 2298) registered in our
   asthma cohort between 2005 and 2009. In winter, a 1 degrees C decrease
   in ambient temperature and a 1 ppb increase in sulfur dioxide
   concentration on the day of Lag 1 were associated with 14.8\% (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.9-26.7) and 19.7\% (95\% CI: 3.3-38.7)
   increases in the risk of RA exacerbation among nonsmokers, respectively.
   Similar associations were obtained on the day of Lag 2. The association
   remained unchanged after excluding patients sensitive to
   Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.
   Conclusions. Exposure to temperature drops and increased sulfur dioxide
   concentrations are positively associated with the occurrence of acute RA
   exacerbation during winter with 1 or 2 day lags.},

Abstract = {Located on the northern edge of the West Pacific Warm Pool and having a
   developed economy and modern infrastructure, Guam is well positioned and
   equipped for obtaining natural records of the west Pacific maritime
   paleoclimate. This study was a proof of concept to explore whether
   useful climate proxy records might be obtained from coral at readily
   accessible, even if geochemically nonoptimal, coastal sites. A 50-year
   Sr/Ca record (1960-2010) was thus obtained from a shallow-water,
   near-shore Porites lutea colony at a recreational facility inside Guam's
   Apra Harbor and compared with local and regional meteorological records,
   including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO) indices. The accessibility of the site enabled
   documentation of relevant environmental variables for 16 months
   (September 2009-December 2010): seawater delta O-18, pH, seawater
   cations, and nitrate. Time series of seawater delta O-18, pH, and
   cations show evidence of freshwater input from direct rainfall and
   stream discharge into the harbor. An anomalously higher mean and
   variable concentrations of Ba suggest the presence of river-borne,
   fine-grained terrigenous sediment. Nevertheless, the Sr/Ca time series
   reproduces a long-term warming trend seen in historical records of local
   air temperature and regional sea-surface temperature (SST) and closely
   tracks the ENSO and PDO indices over the entire 50-year record. The
   consistency of the results with Guam's historical instrumental records,
   previous coral delta O-18 results from Guam obtained by others, and
   previous Sr/Ca proxy results for SST in similar environments elsewhere
   demonstrate that accessible near-shore sites-where environmental
   conditions can be monitored-can produce useful Sr/Ca records of local
   and regional climate phenomena.},

Title = {Rising trend and regional disparities of the global burden of disease
   attributable to ambient low temperature, 1990-2019: An analysis of data
   from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Abstract = {Background Previous studies on the effect of global warming on the
   global burden of disease have mainly focussed on the impact of high
   temperatures, thereby providing limited evidence of the effect of lower
   temperatures. Methods We adopted a three-stage analysis approach using
   data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. First, we explored
   the global burden of disease attributable to low temperatures, examining
   variations by gender, age, cause, region, and country. Second, we
   analysed temporal trends in low-temperature-related disease burdens from
   1990 to 2019 by meta -regression. Finally, we fitted a mixed-effects
   meta -regression model to explore the effect modification of
   country-level characteristics. Results In 2019, low temperatures were
   responsible for 2.92\% of global deaths and 1.03\% of
   disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), corresponding to a death rate of
   21.36 (95\% uncertainty interval (UI) = 18.26, 24.73) and a DALY rate of
   335 (95\% UI = 280, 399) per 100 000 population. Most of the deaths
   (85.12\%) and DALYs (94.38\%) attributable to low temperatures were
   associated with ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease. In the last three decades, we observed an upward
   trend for the annual number of attributable deaths (P < 0.001) and a
   downward trend for the rates of death (P < 0.001) and DALYs (P < 0.001).
   The disease burden associated with low temperatures varied considerably
   among regions and countries, with higher burdens observed in regions
   with middle or high-middle socio-demographic indices, as well as
   countries with higher gross domestic product per capita and a larger
   proportion of ageing population. Conclusions Our findings emphasise the
   significance of raising public awareness and prioritising policies to
   protect global population health from the adverse effects of low
   temperatures, even in the face of global warming. Particular efforts
   should be targeted towards individuals with underlying diseases (e.g.
   cardiovascular diseases) and vulnerable countries or regions (e.g.
   Central Asia and central Europe).},

Title = {Short-Term Exhaust Gas Temperature Trend Prediction of a Marine Diesel
   Engine Based on an Improved Slime Mold Algorithm-Optimized Bidirectional
   Long Short-Term Memory-Temporal Pattern Attention Ensemble Model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {As the core component of a ship's engine room, the operation of a marine
   diesel engine (MDE) directly affects the economy and safety of the
   entire vessel. Predicting the future changes in the status parameters of
   a MDE helps to understand the operational status, enabling timely
   warnings to the engine crew, and to ensure the safe navigation of the
   vessel. Therefore, this paper combines the temporal pattern attention
   mechanism with the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network
   to propose a novel trend prediction method for short-term exhaust gas
   temperature (EGT) forecasting. First, the Pearson correlation analysis
   (PCA) is conducted to identify input feature variables that are strongly
   correlated with the EGT. Next, the BiLSTM network models input feature
   variables such as load, fuel oil pressure, and scavenging air pressure
   and capture the interrelationships between different vectors from the
   hidden layer matrix within the BiLSTM network. This allows the selection
   of valuable information across different time steps. Meanwhile, the
   temporal pattern attention (TPA) mechanism has the ability to explore
   complex nonlinear dependencies between different time steps and series.
   This assigns appropriate weights to the feature variables within
   different time steps of the BiLSTM hidden layer, thereby influencing the
   input effect. Finally, the improved slime mold algorithm (ISMA) is
   utilized to optimize the hyperparameters of the prediction model to
   achieve the best level of short-term EGT trend prediction performance
   based on the ISMA-BiLSTM-TPA model. The prediction results show that the
   mean square error, the mean absolute percentage error, the root mean
   square error and the coefficient of determination of the model are
   0.4284, 0.1076, 0.6545 and 98.2\%, respectively. These values are
   significantly better than those of other prediction methods, thus fully
   validating the stability and accuracy of the model proposed in this
   paper.},

Abstract = {We have previously placed the solar contribution to recent global
   warming in context using observations and without recourse to climate
   models. It was shown that all solar forcings of climate have declined
   since 1987. The present paper extends that analysis to include the
   effects of the various time constants with which the Earth's climate
   system might react to solar forcing. The solar input waveform over the
   past 100 years is defined using observed and inferred galactic cosmic
   ray fluxes, valid for either a direct effect of cosmic rays on climate
   or an effect via their known correlation with total solar irradiance
   (TSI), or for a combination of the two. The implications, and the
   relative merits, of the various TSI composite data series are discussed
   and independent tests reveal that the PMOD composite used in our
   previous paper is the most realistic. Use of the ACRIM composite, which
   shows a rise in TSI over recent decades, is shown to be inconsistent
   with most published evidence for solar influences on pre-industrial
   climate. The conclusions of our previous paper, that solar forcing has
   declined over the past 20 years while surface air temperatures have
   continued to rise, are shown to apply for the full range of potential
   time constants for the climate response to the variations in the solar
   forcings.},

Abstract = {Atlantic Croaker Micropogonias undulatus, Black Drum Pogonias cromis,
   Spot Leiostomus xanthurus, and Weakfish Cynoscion regalis have shown
   species-specific, varying trends in abundance despite general declines
   in commercial landings throughout the Delaware River estuary.
   Identifying how environmental factors and climatic processes affect
   fishes at multiple life stages is needed to enhance the precision of
   regulatory actions for managed species. Species-, area-, and
   age-specific indices were compared with depth, salinity, temperature,
   the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) to explore potential relationships as well as temporal
   and spatial parameters. Our results demonstrate that station (15
   indices), salinity (14 indices), the AMO and NAO (13 indices each), and
   depth and temperature (12 indices each) served as important components
   for models of abundance for 17 species-, age-, and area-specific
   combinations from 1991 to 2016. Significant time series trends were
   detected in six of the modeled indices of abundance, including baywide
   indices of age-1 Weakfish (decline) and age-0 Atlantic Croaker
   (increase); age-0 Atlantic Croaker (increase) and Weakfish (decline) in
   Delaware; and age-1 Spot (decline) and Weakfish (increase) in Delaware.
   Our results demonstrate how multiple fixed-station surveys can be
   combined to quantitatively assess environmental and climatic effects
   correlated with species-, age-, and area-specific levels of abundance,
   suggesting that climatic signals are affecting smaller-scale
   environmental variables that in turn affect relative abundance.},

Abstract = {Background-Associations between an increase in coronary heart disease
   occurrence and low atmospheric temperatures have been reported from
   mortality data and hospital admission registries, However, concomitant
   increases in noncardiovascular case fatality rates and selection bias of
   hospital cases may weaken this observation. In this study, we addressed
   the question of the relationships between fatal and nonfatal coronary
   diseases and meteorological variables in 10-year data (1985 to 1994)
   collected in a morbidity registry (Lille-WHO MONICA Project) monitoring
   257 000 men from 25 to 64 years of age.
   Methods and Results-The impacts of atmospheric temperature (in Celsius)
   and pressure (in millibars) on daily rates of myocardial infarction (MI)
   and coronary deaths were studied. Percentages of variation of event
   rates according to meteorological variations were derived from the
   relative risks estimated with a Poisson regression model. During the
   10-year longitudinal survey, 3616 events occurred. Rates of events
   decreased linearly with increasing atmospheric temperature. For
   atmospheric pressure, we detected a V-shaped relationship, with a
   minimum of daily event rates ai 1016 mbar. A 10 degrees C decrease was
   associated with a 13\% increase in event rates (P < 0.0001); a 10-mbar
   decrease <1016 mbar and a 10-mbar increase >1016 mbar were associated
   with a 12\% increase (P = 0.001) and an 11\% increase (P = 0.01) in
   event rates, respectively. These effects were independent and influenced
   both coronary morbidity and mortality rates, with stronger effects in
   older age groups and for recurrent events.
   Conclusions-This longitudinal study is the first to estimate the
   attributable effect of meteorological variables on MI morbidity in
   population and strongly argues for a systematic fight against cold in
   cardiovascular disease prevention, particularly in older ages and after
   a first MI.},

Abstract = {Background: Few studies have focused on the region-specific relationship
   between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and low temperature worldwide.
   Objective: We aimed to provide an overview of trends in mortality and
   disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for CVD and its subtypes
   attributable to low temperature over the past 30 years in 204 countries
   and regions, along with the associations of these trends with age,
   period, and birth cohorts.
   Methods: Data on the estimated burden of CVDs (including ischemic heart
   disease, hypertensive heart disease, and stroke) attributable to low
   temperature were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.
   We utilized an age-period-cohort model to estimate overall annual
   percentage changes in mortality (net drifts), annual percentage changes
   from 15 similar to 19 to 81 similar to 85 years (local drifts), and
   period and cohort relative risk (period/cohort effects) between 1990 and
   2019.
   Results: Among noncommunicable diseases, CVDs had the highest mortality
   rate and DALY loss attributable to low temperature worldwide and has
   increased from 65.7 to 67.3\%, which is mainly attributed to the
   increase in East Asia and Pacific region. In terms of the level of
   economic and social development, an inverted U-shape was found in the
   age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) due to low-temperature across
   different sociodemographic indices (SDI) regions. Both high CVD
   mortality (19.45, 95\% CI {[}14.54, 24.17\%]) and a decreasing mortality
   rate related to low temperature (from 1990 to 2019, net drift, -3.25\%
   {[}-3.76, 2.73\%] per year) was found in high SDI countries or
   territories, with opposite outcome found in low SDIs regions. The older
   adults (70+) and men share the highest rate of CVD ASMR and DALY
   attributed to low temperature across all regions, especially in North
   America and Europe and Central Asia.
   Conclusion: Mortality and DALY loss from CVD attributable to low
   temperature showed an overall decreasing trend globally except for East
   Asia and Pacific region. SDI, sex, age and geographic location
   contributed to the diversity of the CVD disease burden associated with
   low temperature worldwide. More attention should be given to the older
   adults, men, and low SDI regions.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes temperature trends and thermal comfort during the
   key hours (i.e., from noon to 3:00 p.m.) of human tower (castells)
   performances in four significant festivities involving this outdoor
   exhibition (diada castellera) in Catalonia. Human towers were recognized
   by UNESCO in 2010 as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. The selected
   exhibitions were Sant Joan in Valls on 24 June; Festa Major de La Bisbal
   del Penedes on 15 August; Sant Mag \& iacute; in Tarragona on 19 August;
   and Sant Felix in Vilafranca del Penedes on 30 August. Temperature and
   relative humidity data were downloaded from the Copernicus Climate
   Change Service's ERA5-Land and ERA5 pressure level datasets,
   respectively, with reanalysis from 1951 to 2023. The results revealed a
   clear upward trend in temperatures over the last several decades in
   these four places and for the respective dates, from +0.3 degrees C per
   decade in La Bisbal del Penedes to +0.42 degrees C per decade in Valls.
   Most of the positive temperature anomalies were concentrated in the last
   25 years. The calculation of the Heat Index revealed a higher occurrence
   of years with possible fatigue due to prolonged exposure and/or physical
   activity in the three inland locations (i.e., Valls, La Bisbal del
   Penedes, and Vilafranca del Penedes) and a greater frequency of years
   with possible heat stroke, heat cramps, and/or heat exhaustion in
   Tarragona, which is near the Mediterranean Sea. This warming trend and
   increased discomfort pose potential health risks for participants and
   suggests a need for adaptive measures. These findings emphasize the
   importance of incorporating climate considerations into human tower
   planning.},

Abstract = {This study examines the spatiotemporal variability and trends of
   rainfall in the central highlands of Abbay Basin using the Integrated
   Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG-06) dataset. Parameters on
   onset and cessation dates, dry spells, Coefficient of Variation (CV\%),
   and Standardized Rainfall Anomalies were utilized to evaluate rainfall
   variability and seasonality. Trend analysis was carried out using
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. The results highlighted a
   consistent pattern of late onset and early cessation of rainfall. The CV
   values for annual (10.7\%), kiremt (11.7\%), and belg (10.6\%) seasons
   rainfall indicate moderate variability, while bega (22.6\%) rainfall
   showed higher variability. SRA findings reveal episodic fluctuations
   between wet and dry years. The trend analysis demonstrates a
   statistically significant increasing trend in annual (9.14 mm/year) and
   belg seasons (6.94 mm/year) rainfall. However, kiremt season exhibited
   statistically non-significant (p > 0.05) decreasing trend. The temporal
   variability in rainfall onset, cessation dates and duration
   significantly impacts agricultural processes such as tillage and
   planting operations, affecting crop production. While the study area
   holds potential for agricultural activities, climate variability may
   reduce productivity. Therefore, the study findings are valuable for
   agricultural developers, planners and water resource managers. Including
   additional weather elements is crucial to enhance the precision and
   reliability of these findings for practical applications.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal seasonal and annual rainfall trends and variability
   assessment in the Pangani Basin, East Africa},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {136},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although in situ rainfall data remains the most accurate, the gauge
   network density in East Africa is sparse. It lacks continuity, thus
   making it inadequate to assess the spatial and long-term rainfall trend
   and variability accurately. As such, rainfall remote sensing data are
   normally used instead of ground station data. This study evaluates the
   capabilities and limitations of remote sensing data compared with
   ground-based observations in Tanzania's Pangani Basin in assessing the
   seasonal and annual rainfall trends and variability. Data from the
   Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) and
   twenty-three ground stations were analyzed, comprising a time series
   from 1990 to 2022. Trend analysis was conducted using the Mann-Kendall
   test, while the spatial distribution of precipitation was determined
   using Sen's slope method. CHIRPS annual rainfall showed good agreement
   with station rainfall data, with NSE, R2, slope, Pbias, MAE, and RMSE
   values of 0.84, 0.92, 0.92, 7.55\%, 297.4, and 397.1, respectively. The
   coefficient of variation from station data indicated extreme
   variability, exceeding 30\% for annual rainfall, while CHIRPS data
   showed moderate variability, ranging from 20\% to 30\%. Both station
   data and remote sensing data showed an increasing trend for annual and
   seasonal rainfall at least 10 stations. However, stations like Maji
   Moshi, Kiungu Primary School, Segera C. Tank, and Kibong'oto exhibited
   an increasing trend for vuli rainfall with CHIRPS data, while station
   data indicated a significant decreasing trend.The study highlights the
   necessity for calibration and validation to avert misinterpretations in
   climate trend analyses, especially at the basin level.},

Title = {Detecting topographic effect and urban signature in long-term summer
   rainfall trend in a complex urban environment},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {58},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The influence of topography and urbanization on long-term summer
   rainfall trends in a complex urban environment is poorly understood. In
   this study, we utilized high-resolution gridding data (CN05.1) from 2416
   long-term station observations (1960-2022) to investigate such
   influences over Wuhan, China. A geostatistical and mathematical
   framework was proposed to identify topographic and urban rainfall
   modifications in complex urban environments. The findings indicated that
   the topographic effect influences the region by causing it to experience
   drier conditions in dry years and wetter conditions in wet years, as
   well as increasing the frequency of light rainfall. Urbanization
   slightly suppressed light rainfall but amplified the intensity of other
   forms of rainfall, especially extreme rainfall. As impervious surfaces
   expanded, the urban precipitation-enhancing (UPE) effect diminished in
   the later stages of urbanization, particularly in urban and upwind
   areas, due to factors such as reduced evaporation (ET) and decreased
   relative humidity (RH). The relative contribution of urbanization to
   long-term rainfall trends was enhanced as urbanization increased, with
   increases ranging from 7 \% to 40 \%. This study demonstrates the
   potential of geostatistical and mathematical analysis techniques in
   elucidating the contributions of topography and urbanization to
   long-term rainfall patterns, leading to a better understanding of
   rainfall anomalies in complex urban environments.},

   from 1982-2021 (40 years) employing different trend analysis methods i.e
   ., Mann-Kendall test for trend significance, ASequential Mann-Kendall
   test for assessment of sta rt and end of trend, Sen's slope test for
   trend magnitude, Innovative Trend Analysis for combination of trends and
   linear regression analysis for trend detection. Statistically positive
   trend was detected in summer season using all methods whereas, annual
   and SWM rainfall showed a statistically significant decreasing trend.
   Winter and NEM rainfall resulted with no significant trend. The results
   from this study helps to adopt various water management practices and
   useful for policy makers to prepare appropriate mitigation strategies.},

Abstract = {The article by Al-Najjar et al. (2022a) possesses abundant flaws in
   geopolitical, geographical and hydrological contexts. The paper ignores
   a vast body of scientific literature about the study region of the Negev
   Desert, Israel, in general, and Nahal Besor (Wadi Gaza) in particular.
   The paper's methodology lacks data collection from the field. These gaps
   and flaws lead to erroneous and geopolitically slandered research
   conclusions. Nahal Besor is a large transboundary ephemeral river shared
   between Israel, the West Bank (Palestinian and Israeli territories) in
   the northeast, and finally, its western outlet into the Mediterranean
   Sea is in the Gaza Strip. Despite the current political ordeal between
   the two nations to accurately portray and model the segment of the river
   in the downstream coastal plain of Gaza, it is crucial to use the data
   of upstream Israeli floods that in some events reach the Strip. In this
   comment, we utilize some of the main flaws of Al-Najjar et al. (2022a)
   to demonstrate that how the hypothesized potential flood geohazard of
   Gaza can be significantly reduced by binational and regional cooperation
   such as using upbasin bank-side reservoirs in the northwestern Negev,
   Israel.},

Title = {Short-Duration Extreme Rainfall Events in the Central and Eastern United
   States During the Summer: 2003-2023 Trends and Variability},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {Extreme rainfall events (EREs) caused by convection are a major
   prediction challenge and can lead to deadly flash flooding. This study
   investigates EREs from 2003 to 2023 over the central and eastern United
   States using high-resolution (4-km) Stage IV precipitation analyses.
   EREs were defined where 12-hr accumulations exceeded the 10-year average
   recurrence interval thresholds. Summertime (June-August) EREs exhibited
   pronounced interannual variability, but with statistically significant
   increasing trends in annual frequency, particularly among those caused
   by mesoscale convective systems. Significant relationships were also
   found between summertime convective EREs over the central United States
   and enhanced poleward moisture transport, consistent with a westward
   expansion of the climatological North Atlantic Subtropical High. This
   relationship may aid in medium- and long-range forecasting. However, the
   spatial scale of EREs often included localized or narrow bands of
   extreme accumulations, revealing significant challenges in the accurate
   representation of EREs in weather and climate models.
   Extreme rainfall events often result from slow-moving thunderstorms that
   drop heavy rain over the same area for several hours, which can cause
   deadly flash flooding. This study defines an extreme rainfall event
   where the 12-hr accumulation would only exceed that amount once every 10
   years on average, with a focus on the summer months over the central and
   eastern United States from 2003 to 2023. Our results show a significant
   increasing trend in the number of extreme events, especially those
   caused by larger, longer-duration storms. Our use of a high-resolution
   rainfall data set also revealed that extreme rainfall often occurs due
   to nighttime thunderstorms producing heavy rainfall over highly
   localized areas or narrow (20-40 km wide) swaths. These characteristics
   present a challenge for global weather and climate models. The frequency
   of these summertime extreme events also significantly varied from year
   to year. Summers with more extreme events were associated with a greater
   northward transport of moist air around the western edge of an area of
   high pressure that extends westward from the Atlantic Ocean. The
   relationship between this flow pattern and extreme rainfall suggests a
   possible path for improving forecasts of extreme rainfall.
   High-resolution rainfall data reveal an increasing trend in extreme
   summertime rainfall, especially from mesoscale convective systems More
   events occurred during summers with greater southerly moisture transport
   driven by differences in the North Atlantic Subtropical High The
   relatively small scale of extreme convective rainfall presents a
   challenge for representing these events in weather and climate models},

Title = {Testing trends in gridded rainfall datasets at relevant hydrological
   scales: A comparative study with regional ground observations in
   Southern Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Study region: In this study, we compared the spatiotemporal evolution of
   rainfall trends in E-OBS and ERA5 to those detected using historical
   rainfall series recorded by ground-based networks in Southern Italy. In
   particular, the study is applied to the Campania, Basilicata, Apulia,
   Calabria and Sicily regions (84,000 km(2) in total) on seasonal and
   annual scales. Study focus: Meteorological gridded datasets at large
   spatial scales are widely used in many hydroclimatic applications as
   they provide long and spatially homogeneous records. Regional trend
   analyses based on these data need to be treated with caution due to some
   potential limitations at relevant hydrological scales, such as the
   coarse spatial resolution and the spatio-temporal inhomogeneity of the
   underlying data. Gradual trends and abrupt change points were studied on
   rainfall data from 1979 to 2019. New hydrological insights for the
   region: Both gridded datasets capture the major trends in observed
   rainfall, with a predominance of positive values driven by changes in
   September-November. Overall, ERA5 returns flatter results compared to
   E-OBS, with the former comparing well with observations in Sicily and
   Apulia, while the latter is performing well in Campania and partially in
   Calabria and Basilicata. Most statistically significant trends are
   associated with discontinuities in the early 2000s, and this is well
   captured by both ground and gridded datasets. The general behavior in
   inter-annual variability trends in Southern Italy is captured by both
   datasets, with ERA5 also detecting regional patterns.},

Abstract = {Changes in rainfall and drought significantly impact agriculture and
   water management, making it vital for effective planning and management.
   This study aimed to analyze rainfall trends and drought conditions in
   the Awash River Basin, Ethiopia. Twenty meteorological (1985-2021) and
   nine streamflow (1985-2014) station data were used to analyze rainfall
   trends, variability, and drought conditions based on the Mann-Kendall
   test, innovative trend analysis, standardized precipitation index,
   agricultural standardized precipitation index, reconnaissance drought
   index, effective reconnaissance drought index, and streamflow drought
   index. Based on Mann-Kendall's test results rainfall during the Bega
   season showed a decreasing trend at all stations while Tsedey and Kiremt
   seasons showed an increasing trend at the majority of the stations.
   However, the Belg season and annual rainfall showed no clear trend at
   the majority of the stations. A significant (p < 0.05) increase at Debre
   Berhan and a decrease at Awash7kilo and Ginchi were observed in annual
   rainfall by 44.1, 102.4, and 116.4 mm per decade, respectively. The
   innovative trend analysis revealed the Tsedey and Bega seasons showed
   increasing and decreasing trends in the majority of the stations for all
   rainfall categories, respectively. However, the annual, Belg, and Kiremt
   rainfall showed no clear trend in the majority of the stations for
   different rainfall categories. Annual rainfall showed increasing (Debre
   Berhan, Mojo, and Sheno) and decreasing (Awash7kilo, Dire Dawa, and
   Ginchi) trends for all rainfall categories. Generally, there is high
   variability in rainfall during Tsedey, Bega, and Belg, moderate and low
   variability during Kiremt, and annual with moderate and irregular
   rainfall distribution for the majority of the stations. The drought
   analysis revealed that 15.7, 17.3, 30.7, and 16.3\% of drought periods
   were detected with annual standardized precipitation, agricultural
   standardized precipitation, reconnaissance drought, and effective
   reconnaissance drought indices, respectively. Hydrological drought
   conditions also showed a high probability of occurrence amounting to
   47.6 and 48.2\% for annual and three-month with severe indices of about
   -2.58 and -4.26 found at Awash Melka Sedi and Metehara gauge stations,
   respectively. Moderate to extreme hydrometeorological droughts have
   occurred approximately every six to eight years, with significant
   drought events recorded in 1987/88, 1991/92, 1996/97, 2001/02, 2003/04,
   2014/15, and 2016/17. The results could have paramount importance for
   water resource policies and planning for rainfall variability and
   drought management and adaptation strategies in the Awash River basin.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean Coast in Egypt has witnessed a significant change in
   climate over the past two decades. However, relying solely on prognoses
   without applying rigorous statistical tests may lead to unreliable
   results. This research aimed to investigate the historical performance
   of the rainfall data trend and its change through the time and identify
   the change points along the Mediterranean coast area of Egypt in order
   to gain comprehensive insights into future changes. Thus, four tests
   were applied on the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data
   with spatiotemporal resolution (0.25o, Month) to identify abrupt and
   continuous trends. The applied tests classified into two: parametric and
   non-parametric tests. Non-parametric tests, such as Mann-Kendall and
   Sen's slope tests, were employed to assess trends in the data, while the
   Pettit test was used as a change point test. On the other hand, the
   parametric test employed the Buishand test to detect change points. The
   GPCC rainfall time series last version is available from 1900 until
   2019, where those 119 years of time span are divided into three periods;
   (1900-1940), (1941-1980) and (1981-2019). The research offers a rigorous
   approach to understanding past trends and identifying change points,
   revealing decreasing trends in rainfall during 1900-1940 and 1981-2019.
   January and March had the highest decreases in these periods. 69\% of
   stations showed a significant decrease in annual rainfall, mainly along
   the Mediterranean coast. Change points were identified in 1931 (delta
   region) and 1999 (Sinai), with no significant change in the West delta.},

Abstract = {Improving grain yield (GY) is a major goal of durum wheat breeding
   programs, and a high yield needs to be attained while preserving grain
   quality. The current study evaluated the changes caused by a breeding
   program on the association between GY and grain protein content (PC) in
   Moroccan durum wheat. Field experiments with six leading varieties
   released over three decades were conducted for three growing seasons
   under two water regimes. GY and PC were largely controlled by
   environmental effects, including both the growing season and water
   regime. The year of release and growing season effects were the
   predominant sources of variation in total chlorophyll content (TCC). A
   significant increase in GY with the year of release was observed under
   irrigated conditions, whereas a significant increase in PC over time was
   noted under rainfed conditions. In addition, a negative correlation was
   revealed between GY and PC, which was significant only in the rainfed
   trials. Similarly, a significant and positive association was noted
   between PC and TCC within the rainfed trials, but not in the irrigated
   trials. Based on GGE (genotype main effect plus genotype x environment
   interaction) biplot analysis, the new varieties `Marouane' and `Faraj'
   were identified as desirable varieties in terms of GY and PC close to
   the `ideal genotype'. These results indicated that when grown under
   current irrigated conditions, new varieties improved by the Moroccan
   breeding program showed better GY performance than old varieties.},

Abstract = {As governments continue to address climate change when formulating
   policy, there remains a need to determine if such a change exists in the
   historical record to inform clear indices for monitoring the present
   climate for site-specific interventions. This study characterised trends
   and anomalies in rainfall and dry spells, providing local information
   often projected from satellites or regional data in data-scarce regions.
   From 1961 to 2007, daily rainfall records in Central Malawi were used to
   calculate indices for low-(Balaka), medium-(Bunda, Chitedze, KIA), and
   high-altitude (Dedza) sites, which were then subjected to
   Mann-Kendall's, Cramer's, and Spearman-Rho's trend tests. Significant
   decreasing trends in terms of wet days and growing season length were
   evident across locations. Seasonal and extreme rainfall, dry spells, and
   inter-seasonal and near-decadal anomalies were not consistently or
   inevitably significant. Unexpectedly, rainfall anomalies were largest in
   Bunda and KIA, which have mild climatic regimes, while the lowest were
   in Balaka, a rainfall-averse zone. The relationship between El Ni \&
   ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and extreme rainfall and dry spell
   events did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, extreme
   precipitation and dry spell events show varied intensities and
   proportions rather than increased frequency. The disparate results
   largely justify the need for in-depth local-scale assessments for
   agroclimatic applications.},

Title = {Trends in extreme rainfall and their relationship to flooding episodes
   in Vhembe district, South Africa},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, are being increased by
   climate change in various regions, and such events often cause floods.
   This study examined the trends and variability of extreme rainfall
   indices using daily rainfall data (1981-2023) from three study sites at
   different socio-economic development spectra in Vhembe District, Limpopo
   Province, South Africa. The analyses focus on indices such as the annual
   total rainfall from wet days (PRCPTOT), the maximum number of
   consecutive dry days (CDD) and wet days (CWD), annual maximum 1-day and
   5-day rainfall (RX1 day and RX5 day), the Simple Daily Intensity Index
   (SDII), the number of days exceeding varying amounts of precipitation
   (R10, R20, R40) and the annual number of wet days with rainfall greater
   than the 95th and 99th percentile (R95p and R99p) of the 1981-2023 daily
   rainfall. We discuss the observed trends in extreme rainfall indices in
   light of the actual flood occurrences to establish linkages. Several
   statistically significant and marginal changes in extreme rainfall
   trends were identified and provided key insights into reported flooding
   events in the district-flooding episodes were mainly attributed to the
   significant increases in total precipitation (PRCPTOT) and rainfall
   exceeding the 99th percentile of daily rainfall (R99p). Other
   significant contributors were declining CDD and increasing RX1day at
   Duthuni, increasing R40 at Musina as well as increasing R1 and declining
   CDD at Sane. However, the low altitude, urbanization, poor waste
   management and inadequate drainage systems were among the key
   non-climatic drivers of flood risk across the study sites, but these
   warrant further investigation. The complex interplay between climatic
   and non-climatic drivers of flood risk underscores the importance of
   localized climate studies and the need for adaptive strategies to
   minimize loss and damage. Overall, this research provides valuable
   insights into localized extreme rainfall trends, which are essential for
   developing site-specific flood mitigation and adaptation strategies.
   However, such initiatives require placing vulnerable communities at the
   centre in order to develop solutions that are locally led and relevant.},

Abstract = {A better understanding of the spatiotemporal variation characteristics
   of rainfall erosivity and effects of extreme rainfall events on soil
   erosion is the basis for improved water resource planning, protection,
   and ecological restoration in the Qinling Mountains. Using long-term
   daily precipitation data from 19 national standard meteorological
   stations from 1957 to 2018, the spatiotemporal variation trend of
   rainfall erosivity was explored. A linear regression analysis method was
   used to detect trends in rainfall erosivity. The spatial pattern of
   rainfall erosivity, which is based on annual, seasonal, and extreme
   rainfall indices, was analyzed via a geospatial interpolation method.
   Effects of natural factors and human activities on soil erosion at
   different stages were examined via the double cumulative curve method.
   The average annual rainfall erosivity in the Shangluo area is 2306 MJ mm
   ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1) and generally displays a gradual decreasing trend
   from southeast to northwest. Over the last 60 years, the annual R
   exhibited a nonsignificant increasing trend (p > 0.05). Overall,
   rainfall erosivity showed a phased trend with an increasing trend after
   2000. Rainfall erosivity from June to September accounts for 78.5\% of
   the annual total, while the annual R is mainly determined by a few
   rainfall events during the year. RX1d and RX5d account for 20-40\% and
   60-80\%, respectively, of the total annual R and are likely to result in
   severe soil erosion in sloping cultivated land areas, agricultural
   lands, and dirt roads with continued climate change. Implementation of
   the National Natural Forest Protection Project and the `Grain for Green'
   Project significantly reduced the intensity and scope of soil erosion in
   the area. This study aids in understanding the ecohydrological processes
   and soil erosion and sediment transport characteristics in the Qinling
   Mountains and promotes water resource protection and management along
   the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project.},

Abstract = {Understanding the causes for discrepancies between modelled and observed
   regional climate trends is important for improving present-day climate
   simulation and reducing uncertainties in future climate projections.
   Here, we analyse the performance of coupled climate models in
   reproducing regional precipitation trends during the satellite era. We
   find statistically significant observed drying in southwestern North
   America and wetting in the Amazon during the period 1979-2014.
   Historical climate model simulations do not capture these observed
   precipitation trends. We trace this discrepancy to the inability of
   coupled simulations to capture the observed Pacific trade wind
   intensification over this period. A linear adjustment of free running
   historical simulations, based on the observed strengthening of the
   Pacific trade winds and modeled ENSO teleconnections, explains the
   discrepancy in precipitation trends. Furthermore, both the Pacific trade
   wind trends and regional precipitation trends are reproduced in climate
   simulations with prescribed observed sea surface temperatures (SST),
   underscoring the role of the tropical Pacific SST patterns.},

Abstract = {Understanding regional climatic trends is crucial for taking appropriate
   actions to mitigate the impacts of climate change and managing water
   resources effectively. This study aims to investigate the
   dissimilarities and similarities among various climate stations in
   Bangladesh from 1981 to 2021. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and K-means clustering
   techniques were employed to identify regions with comparable rainfall
   patterns. Moreover, the innovative trend analysis (ITA) and the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test family were utilized to analyze rainfall trends.
   The results indicate that both K-means and FCM methods successfully
   detected two rainfall regions in Bangladesh with distinct patterns. The
   ITA curve analysis revealed that out of the 29 stations, 13 had a
   non-monotonic increasing trend having no monotonic increasing trend, 8
   had a non-monotonic decreasing trend, and 8 exhibited a monotonic
   decreasing trend. Additionally, the MK tests employed in the study
   showed predominantly negative trends across Bangladesh. The majority of
   stations (65.51\%) fell into Cluster 1, while the remaining 34.48\% were
   in Cluster 2. In terms of ITA analysis, 17.24\% of stations exhibited a
   monotonic decrease, while there were no stations with a monotonic
   increase. However, 37.93\% of stations showed a non-monotonic increase,
   and 44.83\% displayed a non-monotonic decrease. These identified regions
   can provide valuable insights for water resource management, disaster
   risk reduction, and agricultural planning. Moreover, detailed rainfall
   analysis can help policymakers and scientists develop sustainable and
   effective regional-scale policies for managing the country's flood and
   drought situations, ultimately supporting agricultural development and
   environmental planning.},

Title = {CMIP6 Models Underestimate Rainfall Trend on South Asian Monsoon Edge
   Tied to Middle East Warming},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {In recent decades, an increase in rainfall has been observed on the
   northwestern edge of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM; NWEISM). However,
   no studies have focused on model performances over NWEISM, which calls
   for an urgent evaluation of models. Here, we utilize historical
   simulations from 24 CMIP6 models to demonstrate that current models tend
   to underestimate the observed increasing rainfall over NWEISM, with only
   similar to 30\% of the observed intensity. The models broadly capture
   the spring Middle East land warming, which is the main driver of
   increased rainfall over NWEISM. Unfortunately, most models fail to
   reproduce the associated significant decrease in sea level pressure over
   the surrounding landmasses. This deficiency results in an ineffective
   trigger of cross-equatorial southwesterly winds, impeding the accurate
   simulation of the poleward shift of the summer low-level jet (LLJ).
   Consequently, it leads to a weaker link from the Middle East warming to
   rainfall enhancement over NWEISM.
   The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) is one of the most spectacular monsoon
   systems in the world. In recent decades, the summer rainfall has been
   found to increase over the northwestern edge of the ISM (NWEISM), such
   as over Pakistan and northwestern India. Reliable model predictions and
   early warning systems for floods in such climate-sensitive regions are
   critical for minimizing the loss of lives, properties and GDPs.
   Unfortunately, the current climate models are unable to accurately
   depict the trend of increased rainfall over NWEISM. Although most models
   can simulate the spring Middle East land warming that triggers rainfall
   enhancement over NWEISM, they cannot accurately reproduce the associated
   summer low-level jet (LLJ). In summary, the strong link of LLJ to the
   spring warming over the Middle East and enhanced rainfall over NWEISM,
   are not accurately captured by the models. This raises serious concerns
   about the reliability of future climate projections for these vulnerable
   regions.
   Current models tend to underestimate the observed increasing rainfall
   over the northwestern edge of the Indian summer monsoon (NWEISM) Only
   30\% of the observed increasing rainfall intensity over NWEISM is
   reproduced by the CMIP6 models Inaccurate simulation of the poleward
   shift of the summer low-level jet induces the poor simulation of
   rainfall enhancement over NWEISM},

Title = {Finer aspects of spatio-temporal variations in Indian summer monsoon
   rainfall trend reversals over the last 120 years},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Prominent multidecadal rainfall trends and trend reversal points in the
   Indian summer monsoon rainfall during 1901-2020 across the four
   homogeneous regions of India have been examined beginning at the
   district level. Employing a robust rainfall pattern identification
   methodology, three significant rainfall trend reversal events have been
   identified during 1930s, 1960s, and 1980s. During the 1930s, central and
   northeast India witnessed a shift from increasing to decreasing rainfall
   trends, while the south peninsula experienced the reverse, resulting in
   a pronounced north-south asymmetry in rainfall pattern over India. In
   the 1960s, south peninsula and northwest India exhibited a reversal in
   rainfall trend from increasing to decreasing, with an opposite trend in
   northeast India, resulting in an east-west asymmetry in the rainfall
   pattern. Unlike the 1930s and 1960s, the rainfall trend reversal during
   the 1980s occurred over all four rainfall homogeneous regions. The three
   regions (south peninsula, central, and northwest) in India experienced
   rainfall trend reversal from decreasing to increasing trends, while the
   northeast experienced the opposite trend reversal, establishing an
   east-west asymmetry in the rainfall pattern. In terms of geographical
   extent, the rainfall trend reversal in the 1980s is the most prominent
   event during the last 120 years of Indian rainfall history as the
   maximum geographical area (similar to 50\%) experienced the rainfall
   trend reversal during this period. In terms of magnitude of rainfall
   amount variation, the rainfall trend reversal during the 1930s is the
   most prominent as more than 30\% of the area had significantly higher
   (or lower) rainfall than the long-term average. Temporal changes are
   observed in the identified spatial asymmetry of rainfall pattern
   indicating that rainfall homogeneous regions in India must have changed
   over time.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Variability Analysis of Rainfall and Water Quality:
   Insights from Trend Analysis and Wavelet Coherence Approach},
Journal = {GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2024},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An understanding of the trend and relationship between rainfall patterns
   and water quality dynamics can provide valuable guidelines for the
   effective management of water resources. The aim of this study was to
   reveal the synchronous trends in rainfall and water quality and to
   explore the potential connection between seasonal variation in rainfall
   volume and the water quality index. This study scrutinised the seasonal
   temporal trends of rainfall and water quality parameters of three water
   supply reservoirs in the Toowoomba region of Australia by applying the
   modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test and innovative trend analysis (ITA)
   methods from data collected over 22 years (2002-2022). The models showed
   a significant increasing trend of rainfall in two rainfall stations
   during autumn season. The water quality parameters, such as PO43-,
   exhibited a significant decreasing trend in all seasons in three
   reservoirs. On the other hand, the water quality index (WQI) showed a
   decreasing trend in the Cooby and Cressbrook reservoirs, excepting the
   Perseverance reservoir, which exhibited an increasing trend. In addition
   to the detection of trends, this study investigated the potential
   correlation between seasonal variation of rainfall volume and the water
   quality index using the wavelet transform coherence (WTC) method. The
   data of twelve rainfall stations were brought into this analysis. The
   WTC analysis displayed an apparent correlation between the water quality
   index and rainfall pattern for 70\% of the rainfall stations across 8-16
   periods. The highest coherency was noticed in 8-16 periods from
   2002-2022, as observed at both the Cooby Creek rainfall station and in
   the WQI of the Cooby reservoir. This evaluation revealed the intertwined
   dynamics of rainfall patterns and water quality, providing a deeper
   understanding of their interdependence and implications, which might be
   useful for environmental and hydrological management practices.},

Abstract = {Studies related to monitoring changes in frequency, intensity and
   duration of precipitation extremes are key to creating efficient climate
   change measures and forest conservation policies. This study describes
   new insights into rainfall precipitation extremes over the Amazon basin
   (AB) during the last four decades (1981-2021) from the Climate Hazards
   Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPSv2). Here we
   analysed the trends of daily extreme precipitation indices proposed by
   the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) at the
   seasonal scale, using the trend-empirical orthogonal function (TEOF).
   Our results indicate that the frequency of precipitation extremes
   increased over Peruvian Amazonia and northeastern Brazilian Amazonia,
   and reduced in the centre of AB, mainly during the first seasons of the
   year: December-January-February (DJF) and March-April-May (MAM). The
   cooling trend over the eastern and central tropical Pacific and the
   warming trend over the tropical and western subtropical Pacific could
   associate with the increase in frequency of precipitation extremes in
   DJF. Furthermore, during June-July-August (JJA) and
   September-October-November (SON), rainfall intensity indices showed a
   decrease in Colombia and the Bolivian Amazon; in contrast, northern and
   southern Peru delivered an increased pattern. The trend pattern in the
   JJA and SON seasons could be associated with a warming trend over most
   of the North Atlantic and a cooling in the 40 degrees-60 degrees S band.
   Our results demonstrate that the precipitation extremes over the AB have
   spatially varying trends. These heterogeneous trends over the space
   might be take into account for robust adaptation policies over the
   countries that are parts of the AB, such as Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia,
   Ecuador, Guyana, Per \& uacute;, Surinam and Venezuela.
   The trend-empirical orthogonal function (TEOF) approach allowed us to
   identify the spatiotemporal patterns of trends in extreme rainfall
   intensity and frequency indices over the Amazon basin and their
   differential relationship with trends in large-scale climate variability

Journal = {PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {181},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Daily gridded rainfall data from 1901 to 2020, were used to study the
   seasonal variation of the Extreme Rainfall Events (EREs) and Cumulative
   Exceedance (CumExc) at the 95th and 99th percentile thresholds in the
   North-Western Indian Himalayan Region (NW-IHR). The Mann-Kendall and
   Modified Mann-Kendall tests were used to assess the trends in EREs
   across seasons, besides comparing the CumExc and frequency of EREs
   between 1961-1990 and 1991-2020. Additionally, return periods of CumExc
   were estimated to predict future rainfall intensities. Among the 49
   NW-IHR districts, Bandipore (J\&K) reported the highest EREs (> 95th
   percentile) during winter and pre-monsoon, Baramulla (J\&K) during
   post-monsoon, and Pithoragarh (UK) during monsoon. At the 99th
   percentile, Lahaul \& Spiti (HP) recorded the most number of EREs in
   winter, Bandipore (J\&K) in pre-monsoon, Pithoragarh (UK) in monsoon,
   and Baramulla (J\&K) in post-monsoon. The trends of EREs indicate a
   substantial increase (at > 99th percentile) for all seasons in most of
   the region. EREs intensity between 1991-2020 is significantly higher
   than 1961-1990, particularly in the northern region during winter.
   Nevertheless, during pre- and post-monsoon seasons, most areas
   experienced a decline in EREs and CumExc. Estimates of CumExc suggest
   that UK is likely to encounter higher intensities of rainfall extremes
   compared to HP, J\&K, and Ladakh within a 5-year and 10-year return
   period. This study is crucial for understanding extreme weather events
   in a climate change-sensitive region, providing insights into EREs
   frequency, trends, and return periods, which can aid in predicting flash
   floods and facilitating effective planning and mitigation strategies.},

Title = {GIS-based spatio-temporal analysis of rainfall trends under climate

Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of climatic conditions within
   a region is paramount for informed rural planning and decision-making
   processes, particularly in light of the prevailing challenges posed by
   climate change and variability. This study undertook an assessment of
   the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall trends across various
   agro-ecological zones (AEZs) within Wolaita, utilizing data collected
   from ten strategically positioned rain gauge stations. The detection of
   trends and their magnitudes was facilitated through the application of
   the Mann-Kendall (MKs) test in conjunction with Sen's slope estimator.
   Spatial variability and temporal trends of rainfall were further
   analyzed utilizing ArcGIS10.8 environment and XLSTAT with R programming
   tools. The outcomes derived from ordinary kriging analyses unveiled
   notable disparities in the coefficient of variability (CV) for mean
   annual rainfall across distinct AEZs. Specifically, observations
   indicated that lowland regions exhibit relatively warmer climates and
   lower precipitation levels compared to their highland counterparts.
   Within the lowland AEZs, the majority of stations showcased
   statistically non-significant positive trends (p > 0.05) in annual
   rainfall, whereas approximately two-thirds of midland AEZ stations
   depicted statistically nonsignificant negative trends. Conversely, over
   half of the stations situated within highland AEZs displayed
   statistically non-significant positive trends in annual rainfall. During
   the rainy season, highland AEZs experienced higher precipitation levels,
   while the south-central midland areas received a moderate amount of
   rainfall. In contrast, the northeast and southeast lowland AEZs
   consistently received diminished rainfall across all seasons compared to
   other regions. This study underscores the necessity for the climate
   resilient development and implementation of spatiotemporally informed
   interventions through implementing region-specific adaptation
   strategies, such as water conservation measures and crop
   diversification, to mitigate the potential impact of changing rainfall
   patterns on agricultural productivity in Wolaita.},

Abstract = {The success of climate-smart agriculture in high rainfall zone lies in
   understanding the rainfall trend and planning or modifying the cropping
   system for maximum yield. Moisture stress in critical crop growth stages
   is detrimental to the crop and drastically reduces the yield.
   Udhagamandalam region in Western Ghats is a high rainfall area and is
   largely cultivated by vegetable crops. Rainfall trend based crop
   planning would enhance the crop yield without water stress. A study was
   carried out at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Dhemaji,
   Assam focused on assessing the long-term seasonal and monthly rainfall
   trends of Udhagamandalam region, Tamil Nadu using non-parametric tests
   and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA). Daily rainfall of 62 years from
   1960-2021 was analyzed with non-parametric tests, viz. Mann-Kendall and
   modified Mann-Kendall and ITA to find the seasonal rainfall
   characteristics. MannKendall (3.055) and modified Mann-Kendall (3.055)
   tests showed a significantly increasing trend in the annual and seasonal
   monsoonal rainfall. ITA revealed either a significant positive or a
   negative trend in all the months except February, with the highest trend
   in June (2.625). In contrast to standard non-parametric tests, ITA
   detected a significant positive trend in all seasons and annual
   rainfall, except in cold winters where the trend is negative. The
   long-term trend analysis results suggest that the ITA is more precise
   for rainfall trend analysis than standard non-parametric tests and can
   be used to evaluate hidden variations of rainfall trends. Hence, ITA is
   recommended for analyzing rainfall trends for crop planning in
   high-rainfall regions. IT analysis of 62 years of rainfall data of
   Udhagamandalam suggested that vegetable crop planning can be done by
   farmers from August-November months as the rainfall trend during this
   period is assured as an increasing trend of rainfall pattern was
   observed.},

Title = {Trend and Variability Analysis of Annual Maximum Rainfall Using Observed
   and Remotely Sensed Data in the Tropical Climate Zones of Uganda},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {14},

Abstract = {Understanding rainfall variability and trends is crucial for effective
   water resource management and disaster preparedness, particularly in
   tropical regions like Uganda. This study analyzes the trends and
   variability of the Annual Maximum Series (AMS) and seasonal rainfall
   data across four rainfall stations in Uganda, comparing observed data
   with various Remotely Sensed Rainfall (RSR) products. The key methods
   used in this study include the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope
   estimator for trend analysis, AMS rainfall variability analysis using
   statistical performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient
   of Efficiency (NSE) and Percent Bias (PBIAS), and data distribution
   comparisons based on goodness-of-fit evaluation using the
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The results indicate that most trends in
   the seasonal rainfall and AMS data are statistically insignificant.
   However, the September to November (SON) observed rainfall at the Gulu
   station shows a statistically significant increasing trend of 7.68
   mm/year (p-value = 0.03). Based on the PBIAS metric, GPCC and NOAA\_CPC
   products outperform other RSR data products. At the Jinja station,
   NOAA\_CPC has a PBIAS value of -12.93\% and GPCC, -14.64\%; at Soroti,
   GPCC has -9.66\% and NOAA\_CPC, -14.79\%; at Mbarara, GPCC has -5.93\%
   and NOAA\_CPC, -11.63\%; and at Gulu, GPCC has -3.05\% and NOAA\_CPC,
   -19.23\%. The KS test results show significant differences in the
   distribution of RSR data and observed rainfall data, though GPCC shows
   significant agreement at the Gulu (p-value = 0.60) and Mbarara (p-value
   = 0.14) stations. Additionally, NOAA\_CPC outperforms other RSR data
   products at the Mbarara station, with a KS p-value of 0.24. This study
   highlights the limitations of current RSR datasets in replicating
   observed AMS rainfall data. Based on KS test results, GPCC is identified
   as a better product for hydrological applications at the Gulu, Jinja,
   and Soroti station areas compared to other RSR products. For the Mbarara
   station, NOAA\_CPC outperforms other RSR products.},

Abstract = {Hydro-meteorological trend analysis is critical for assessing climate
   change and variability at basin and regional levels. This study examined
   the long- and short-term trends from stream discharge and rainfall data
   in the Lake Kariba Catchment. A trend and change point analysis was
   carried out on the mean, minimum and maximum monthly average time series
   for 14 gauging stations that are located within the Kariba catchment.
   The Mann-Kendall and the Pettitt tests were used to determine the trend
   and any changes in the long-term average of the time series. The
   magnitude of the trend was determined by Sen's slope method. The results
   indicate that generally there has been a decreasing trend in river and
   rainfall long-term mean values across the catchment. A statistically
   significant trend (p <= 0.05) was observed at Zambezi River at Lukulu,
   Senanga and Victoria Falls, with a positive correlation in Pearsons's
   coefficient of water levels and rainfall at Lukulu (0.312) and Senanga
   (0.365). The decrease in the time series trend and the change point
   observed have been attributed to anthropogenic activities, climate
   change and variability impact on the catchment. The findings are
   critical for climate risk management and reduction decisions for near-
   and long-term timescales.},

Title = {Cured or fresh? Between fish maturation trends in restaurants and food
   safety: The case of dry-aged rainbow trout},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {165},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The application of dry aging on fish is increasing in restaurants
   worldwide. This process determines fluid loss, changes in muscle
   texture, and the development of a more concentrated flavour appreciated
   by consumers. Despite the growing popularity in the foodservice
   industry, there is a lack of data on potential risks and quality
   conditions of dry-aged fish. This study was aimed at assessing the
   safety for consumption of whole rainbow trout subjected to dry aging in
   a local restaurant (Turin, Italy). Quantitative microbiological analyses
   and detection of foodborne pathogens were performed on dorsal, ventral
   muscles, and skin samples at day 0, 3, 6, 10, and 14 of dry aging.
   Changes in water activity ( a w ), pH, colour, and biogenic amines in
   muscle were checked at each sampling point. Almost all the
   microbiological indicators were below the quantification limits in
   muscle until day 6 of dry aging, while higher but still acceptable loads
   were observed at day 10. At day 14, yeasts and moulds exceeded the
   acceptable level in one case (3.3 +/- 0.4 log 10 CFU/g) in ventral
   muscle and counts of Pseudomonas spp. (from 6.1 +/- 0.8 to 6.4 +/- 0.5
   log 10 CFU/g), total mesophilic (from 4.4 +/- 0.3 to 5.3 +/- 0.7 log 10
   CFU/g), and psychrophilic (from 5.4 +/- 0.1 to 5.8 +/- 0.3 log 10 CFU/g)
   bacteria indicated the approaching of spoilage. Detection of Listeria
   monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus was always negative during the
   trials. Minimal changes of pH and colour were observed, while a w values
   followed a decreasing trend during dry aging. Putrescine was the only
   detectable amine, with a maximum concentration of 2.05 +/- 0.02 mg/kg at
   day 14. In this study, dry-aged rainbow trout was safe for consumption
   and 10 days was the most appropriate curing time with 3 degrees C and
   78\% of relative humidity. Further studies at different environmental
   conditions and on other fish species are needed for a comprehensive risk
   assessment of this fast-growing practice in the restaurant sector.},

Title = {Impacts of climate change on winter flood mechanisms: Spatial
   variability, trends, and bivariate frequency of rain-on-snow and soil
   frost},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {638},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Rain-on-snow (RoS) events are projected to become more frequent and
   affect more regions around the globe with the increase in temperatures
   and shifting of precipitation patterns due to climate change. However,
   to date, little research has addressed the coincidence of RoS and frost
   for the historical and future climatic conditions that can amplify
   surface flooding. The goal of this study was therefore to assess the
   impacts of climate change on the frequency, magnitude, and trends of RoS
   events co-occurring with soil frost at three sites with different cold
   climates (sub-arctic, continental, and arctic tundra). To that end, an
   ensemble of four regional climate models (RCMs) was used to estimate the
   potential changes in RoS during frost for a historical period
   (1950-2005) and three future climate scenarios representing low, medium,
   and high emissions scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) for the period of
   2006-2100. Field observations were used to evaluate the spatial
   variability and trends in hydrometeorological variables for the observed
   period dating back to 1949 and to calibrate and validate the
   Simultaneous Heat and Water model (SHAW) and the Accumulation and
   Ablation model (SNOW-17), which provided long-term soil temperature,
   frost, and snow depth data. RoS volume during frost was projected to
   decrease by the end of the century but remains an important (if not the
   largest) contributor to large winter runoff events at all study sites.
   The reduction in RoS volumes during frost was most pronounced in the two
   coastal regions in the south and north of Iceland, especially for the
   high emissions scenario (similar to 0.28 mm/year), while the inland
   northeastern site experienced the least changes for all emissions
   scenarios. Frost depth was projected to decrease at the three study
   sites, but at a higher rate at the coastal northern site than in the
   other two regions, and to mostly disappear in the south study site for
   the high-emissions scenario. High-latitude coastal regions are expected
   to transition in the coming decades to become more temperate and
   experience frequent RoS events more than inland regions, while RoS
   contribution to runoff in the presence of soil frost might become less
   relevant at low latitudes by the end of the century.},

Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The monthly and annual trends and variance of rainfall have been studied
   for five stations in an economically important Bangladeshi district
   named Sirajganj since 1965 to 2021. Natural disasters have prevalent in
   Sirajganj which is indispensable to assess. But, several researchers
   have been normally focused on river bank management and flood risk
   assessment. However, no extensive research has been conducted on
   Sirajganj based on non-normally distributed time series meteorological
   data such as rainfall time series so the current study is very
   important. In this study, the non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's
   methods have been used to determine the statistical significance of a
   positive or negative trend in rainfall data. Also, cumulative sum charts
   and bootstrapping, one-way ANOVA, Tukey's range tests, and linear
   regression have been used to discover the incidence of abrupt changes,
   compare the significant difference in monthly and annual rainfall data,
   multiple comparisons amidst mentioned stations to find changes, and to
   investigate the changeover on dry and rainy days, respectively. The
   analysis showed a statistically significant decreasing trends in monthly
   and annual rainfall series. As well, changes from positive to negative
   direction have been recognized in the February, May, July, September,
   and annual rainfall time sequence. Besides, ANOVA and Tukey's range
   tests revealed a statistically substantial difference in all monthly and
   annual rainfall volume excluding January, March, and June. Additionally,
   these two tests demonstrated momentous differences in all monthly and
   annual frequency of rainfall categories excepting January and April.
   However, Linear regression analysis revealed that the number of dry days
   gradually reduced at the end of the dry winter, though the number of
   rainy days decreased during the rainy season. As in, the number of rainy
   days replaces the number of dry days during the dry season and vice
   versa during the rainy season. Even though, with very few exceptions,
   the volume of rainfall decreases throughout the year. The outcomes of
   this research might helpful for implementing the planning and evaluating
   hydrological projects on Sirajganj district.},

Abstract = {Rainfall plays a vital role in the field of agriculture as it affects
   agricultural production and associated economy. However, the changing
   trend of rainfall has become a global concern. So the study of changes
   in the trend of rainfall is necessary. In the present study, an
   innovative trend analysis method was adopted to assess the changing
   trend in the state of Nagaland. Data of 40 years was taken for
   performing the trend analysis using ITA. The entire process of trend
   change analysis was automated using Python programming. The analysis
   indicated that out of the 11 stations considered, three stations
   indicated a rising trend, eight indicated falling trends (annual), four
   rising and seven falling (monsoon), 0 rising and 11 falling (winter).
   The extent of trend change varied from -34.5 to 1.1. The spatial
   distribution of the trend change was also performed. It was observed
   that the southeast part of Nagaland's rising trend was more pronounced
   compared to the southwest. The change was more prominent during the
   winter season followed by pre-monsoon and monsoon. The trend analysis is
   important for making appropriate water management decisions, such as
   water conservation in areas with falling trends and soil conservation in
   areas affected by rising trends.},

Title = {Population trends in an endemic dwarf succulent over two decades:
   rainfall, elevation, microsite and landuse effects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {223},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Bijlia dilatata (Prince Albert Vygie) is a red-listed succulent
   (Aizoaceae) endemic to a single valley in the Western Cape and
   restricted to disjunct sites in quartzite pavements. Populations of this
   species were surveyed in 2002 during above-average rainfall and again in
   2020 and 2021 during drought, and in June 2023 following droughtbreaking
   rains. We found that populations declined over the two low-rainfall
   decades, that declines differed significantly among sites, that
   mortality was greater among smaller plants and that recruitment had
   failed. Our hypothesis that elevation provides a refuge from
   heat-induced mortality was supported by data that showed decreasing
   population decline along a 300 m elevation gradient. Factors
   significantly influencing population structure included landuse (grazing
   intensity), microsites and initial population density. Shaded microsites
   beneath living shrubs and adjacent to large rocks were significantly
   cooler and stayed moister longer after rain and B. dilatata plants in
   such microsites were larger than those in open sites or beneath dead
   shrubs. Grazing and climate change, including reduced winter rainfall,
   and increased ambient and soil surface temperatures, appear to be
   contributing to declines in endemic, habitat specialist dwarf succulents
   already threatened by land transformation and poaching in the
   biodiverse, Succulent Karoo region of South Africa.},

Title = {Irregularity and time series trend analysis of rainfall in Johor,
   Malaysia},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Due to its effect on weather and its propensity to cause catastrophic
   incidents, climate change has garnered considerable global attention.
   Depending on the area, the effects of climate change may vary. Rainfall
   is among the most significant meteorological factors associated with
   climate change. In Malaysia, changes in rainfall distribution pattern
   have led to many floods and droughts events which lead to La Nina and El
   Nino where Johor is one of the states in southern part that usually
   affected. Thus, rainfall trend analysis is important to identify changes
   in rainfall pattern as it gives an initial overview for future analysis.
   This research aims to evaluate historical rainfall data of Johor between
   1991 and 2020. Normality and homogeneity tests were used to ensure the
   quality of data followed by Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope analysis to
   determine rainfall trend as the rainfall data is not normally
   distributed (p > 0.05). Standardized precipitation anomaly, coefficient
   of variation, precipitation concentration index and rainfall anomaly
   index were used to identify rainfall variability and intensity while
   standard precipitation index was used to evaluate drought severity. The
   lowest annual rainfall recorded was 1725.07 mm in 2016 and the highest
   was 2993.19 mm in 2007. Annual rainfall and seasonal rainfall showed a
   declining trend although it is not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
   Results reveal that Johor experienced extreme wet and dry years, leading
   to drought and flood incidents. Major floods arose in 2006, 2007, 2008,
   2010 and 2011 while driest years occurred in 1997, 1998 and 2016 which
   led to El Nino phenomenon. March and April were identified as the driest
   months among all. Thus, the findings from this study would assist
   researchers and decision-makers in the development of applicable
   adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce climate change impact. It
   is recommended that more data analysis from more stations should be done
   in the future research study to obtain a clearer view and more
   comprehensive results.},

Abstract = {Historical fluctuations in hydroclimatic variables can reveal important
   information about water resource changes in any basin. The innovative
   polygon trend analysis (IPTA) method was used to analyze 45-year
   rainfall data from eight monitoring stations in the Mae Klong River
   Basin, Thailand. The IPTA graphics were developed for the mean monthly
   rainfall and the standard deviation of the monthly rainfall for each
   station. In addition, the IPTA results were compared with the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test and the Sen's slope method. The IPTA graphics
   showed no regular polygon for any rainfall station, which indicated
   variability of rainfall over the years. The IPTA method showed
   increasing trends for the month of April while decreasing trends in the
   month of October for the majority of the stations (7 of 8). A good
   agreement for detection of trends was found between the IPTA method and
   the MK test. Both the methods found trends (increasing/decreasing) for
   69 months (72\%) and showed no trend for 27 months (28\%) out of a total
   of 96 months. The findings of this study could benefit water supply and
   management, drought monitoring, and agricultural production activities
   in the Mae Klong River Basin in the future.},

Abstract = {In the current study, three optimistic (SSP1-2.6), medium (SSP2-4.5),
   and pessimistic (SSP5-8.5) scenarios were used to examine changes in
   precipitation based on the sixth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project (CMIP6) in the Gorganrood watershed over two time periods: the
   near future (2021-2060) and the far future (2061-2100). To do this, the
   rainfall of 27 meteorological stations was studied. Using the RClimdex
   software in the R software, precipitation extreme indicators (11
   indicators) were determined for different scenarios and periods, and
   Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's estimator tests were then used to detect the
   trend. The results showed that in the near future under SSP1-2.6, the
   indicators of consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD)
   have a significant downward and upward trend, respectively. While in the
   SSP5-8.5, the indicators of maximum five-day rainfall (RX1day), CDD,
   number of very wet days (R95p) and total wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT)
   have a significant downward trend in some stations. Similarly, in the
   far future, in the SSP5-8.5, the trend of rainfall indicators is
   insignificant compared to the near future, but still a significant
   decreasing trend can be seen in R95p, R99p, and PRCPTOT. Z score index
   (ZI) values in both future periods showed that drought peaks occurred in
   the optimistic scenario and drought peaks occurred in the pessimistic
   scenario, and almost normal conditions prevailed in the intermediate
   scenario. The results can be effective in policies to deal with global
   warming and climate change.},

Title = {Investigation of the Historical Trends and Variability of Rainfall
   Patterns during the March-May Season in Rwanda},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study explores the spatiotemporal variability and determinants of
   rainfall patterns during the March to May (MAM) season in Rwanda,
   incorporating an analysis of teleconnections with oceanic-atmospheric
   indices over the period 1983-2021. Utilizing the Climate Hazards Group
   Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset, the study employs
   a set of statistical tools including standardized anomalies, empirical
   orthogonal functions (EOF), Pearson correlation, the Mann-Kendall (MK)
   trend test, and Sen's slope estimator to dissect the intricacies of
   rainfall variability, trends, and their association with large-scale
   climatic drivers. The findings reveal a distinct southwest to northwest
   rainfall gradient across Rwanda, with the MK test signaling a decline in
   annual precipitation, particularly in the southwest. The analysis for
   the MAM season reveals a general downtrend in rainfall, attributed in
   part to teleconnections with the Indian Ocean Sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs). Notably, the leading EOF mode for MAM rainfall demonstrates a
   unimodal pattern, explaining a significant 51.19\% of total variance,
   and underscoring the pivotal role of atmospheric dynamics and moisture
   conveyance in shaping seasonal rainfall. The spatial correlation
   analysis suggests a modest linkage between MAM rainfall and the Indian
   Ocean Dipole, indicating that negative (positive) phases are likely to
   result in anomalously wet (dry) conditions in Rwanda. This comprehensive
   assessment highlights the intricate interplay between local rainfall
   patterns and global climatic phenomena, offering valuable insights into
   the meteorological underpinnings of rainfall variability during Rwanda's
   critical MAM season.},

Title = {Characterization of annual and seasonal rainfall trend using innovative
   trend analysis (ITA) and classical methods: the case of Wadi Sebou basin
   (WSB) Morocco},
Journal = {EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean domain is one of the hot spots of climate change;
   drought and rainfall decline combined with the rise of temperatures and
   heat waves are the most impactful of these changes, which are well
   described in the recent studies. Morocco is one country where harmful
   effects on agricultural activities and water supply management have been
   observed. The aim of this work is to present the temporal and spatial
   patterns of annual and four seasonal rainfall series during the period
   of 1961-2018 at 15 stations within the Wadi Sebou basin of northern
   Morocco. Rainfall trends were investigated using classical Mann-Kendall
   (MK) and Theil Sen slope nonparametric tests and compared with the new
   innovative trend analysis (ITA) at 95\% and 99\% confidence levels. The
   spatial and temporal results of classical and ITA approaches are
   compared through maps of annual and seasonal trends. The results show a
   decreasing amount of -20\% to -40\% of the total annual precipitation
   over the study period. High values of rainfall show a clear trend to
   increase during autumn, and a general downward trend during winter and
   spring. With the sensitivity of the ITA method for trend detection, a
   high number of significant trends were detected by ITA method compared
   with the classical MK test. This finding highlights the capacity of the
   ITA method to detect hidden trends that cannot be detected by the MK
   test, with 70/75 or 93\% of the cases found significant for ITA against
   only 27/75 or 36\% of the significant cases for MK test. The other
   advantage of ITA stems from its capacity to show trends within three
   clusters of ``high,{''} ``medium,{''} and ``low{''} rainfall values. The
   results of this study will help managers to understand the rainfall
   variability in the Sebou river basin, to improve their mitigation
   strategies and to have a prospective view on the impact of climate
   change on the river basins and water resources plans.},

Abstract = {This study was employed to investigate the temporal variability and
   trend analysis of areal rainfall in the Muger subwatershed, Upper Blue
   Nile, Ethiopia. The study was run over the following procedures to
   handle the main objective: (1) determining the areal rainfall from
   gauged point rainfall using the Thiessen polygon method, (2) grouping
   the months in the season according to the study area, (3) evaluating the
   temporal dynamics of annual and seasonal areal rainfall using the
   coefficient of variation (CV), standard anomaly index (SAI), and
   precipitation concentration index (PCI), and (4) analyzing the trend of
   annual and seasonal areal rainfall using modified Mann-Kendall's
   (modifiedmk) test in RStudio. Based on the temporal variability
   analysis, CV results depict that annual and summer areal rainfall had
   low variability with values of 13.43\% and 13.7\%, respectively. Winter
   and spring areal rainfall shows high variation with a CV value of 50.5\%
   and 36\%, respectively. According to the SAI output, around 70\% of the
   considered year was in the normal condition of wetness. On the other
   hand, the seasonal (winter, spring, and summer) rainfall distribution of
   the study area shows strong irregularity distribution throughout the
   considered years as a result of PCI with a value of 57.5\%. The trend of
   the areal rainfall was shown to be both increasing and decreasing.
   However, the trend was insignificant with a 10\% confidence level.},

Abstract = {The hydrological cycle is significantly impacted by climatic changes,
   and understanding such changes using statistical or graphical methods is
   essential for proper management of water resources. This study performs
   the applications of two most recently proposed variants of popular Sen's
   Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) methods namely Innovative Polygonal
   Trend Analysis (IPTA) and Innovative Trend Pivot Analysis (ITPA) for
   analysing the temporal trend of rainfall data of India. The rainfall
   data of All India along with five Homogeneous regions spanning from
   1871-2016, are considered for this study. In order to determine the
   transition of changes throughout months and seasons, the trend length
   and trend slope were computed, which explicitly demonstrated a climatic
   shift in the rainfall of the Indian main land. The IPT and ITP analyses
   were carried out on both arithmetic mean (AM) and standard deviation
   (SD) based frameworks and SD of the data is found to be more decisive
   for monthly and seasonal rainfall over Indian regions in inducing
   climate non stationarity. The Central Northeast and North East regions
   show vulnerability to changing climate in rainfall magnitude and
   variability, while North West and West Central regions brings more risk
   as captured by ITPA method.},

Abstract = {Studying rainfall patterns is very important because agricultural
   production and flood conditions depend on proper water management.
   Therefore, accurately identifying trends in climate scenarios is
   essential to achieve this goal. This study, therefore, analyses rainfall
   trends using the Mann-Kendall test (MKT), modified Mann-Kendall test
   (MMKT), Spearman rank correlation (SRC), Sen slope estimator (SSE), and
   innovative trend analysis method (ITAM). This investigation analyses
   annual, monsoon, autumn, summer, and winter rainfall trends using the
   most extensive hydrometeorological time series from 1901 to 2020. Five
   such methods of trend analysis use 120 years of gridded meteorological
   data from the India Meteorological Department for the neighbouring four
   river basins Kangsabati, Keliaghai, Silabati, and Dwarkeswer in east
   India. For the winter period, no significant trend is detected using the
   MKT, MMKT, SRC, and SSE. While the ITAM detects a significant trend at
   88\% of grid points of the study area. During other seasons, the MKT,
   MMKT, SRC and SSE notice trends for 76\% of grid points with less
   significance than the ITAM method. Overall results obtained using the
   ITAM and MMKT methods are proved to be more effective in detecting
   sensitive trends. This study can serve as scientific support for the
   identification and strategic mitigation of climatic change impacts on
   water management to reduce the risk of climate change.},

Abstract = {The two major archipelagos of India, the Andaman \& Nicobar Islands and
   the Lakshadweep situated in the climate -hazardous areas of the Bay of
   Bengal and Arabian Sea respectively are largely affected by weather
   systems developing over the sea and heavy rainfall activities. The
   recent two daily gridded rainfall data sets published by IMD; Rajeevan
   et al. (2010) at 1(degrees) x 1(degrees); spatial resolution and Pai et
   al. (2014) at 0.25(degrees) x 0.25(degrees) spatial resolution extending
   for a period of more than 100 years have been extensively used by
   researchers to study the rainfall characteristics at various
   spatiotemporal scales over the Indian mainland. However, these data sets
   do not include the grids over these two island meteorological
   subdivisions of India mainly because of the absence of daily rainfall
   observation for this long period. In this study, an attempt has been
   made to develop daily gridded rainfall data over these island
   subdivisions for the recent 70 years (1951 to 2020) in two spatial
   resolutions, viz., 1(degrees) x 1(degrees) and 0.25(degrees) x
   0.25(degrees) using all the available islands station data during the
   period and carry out statistical analyses of various rainfall
   characteristics over these islands. The 0.25(degrees) x 0.25(degrees)
   data set was observed to be more comparable with the official rainfall
   time series of IMD for both these two Island subdivisions, and hence
   this data set has been used to carry out the trend analysis of Daily
   events of rainfall DER (> = 5 mm) for these two island subdivisions for
   the whole data period of 1951-2020 and the climate regime shift period
   of 1971-2020. DER was classified into two categories DMR (5-100 mm),
   daily moderate rainfall events and DHR (100 mm and above) daily heavy
   rainfall events. Signs and magnitude of the long-term trends in the
   frequency of DER (with DMR \& DHR) showed significant changes during the
   recent period 1971-2020.},

Abstract = {Climate risks have posed a major threat to many local communities living
   in low-lying coastal megacities across the globe, including Ho Chi Minh
   City, Vietnam. Hence, this study first aimed to contribute towards a
   comprehensive understanding of temporal trend patterns of annual
   rainfall and absolute extremes in Ho Chi Minh City over the last 4
   decades (1980-2022) through multiple non-parametric statistical trend
   tests. We employed the quantile delta mapping (QDM) method to develop
   daily bias-corrected rainfall data based on the outputs in the latest
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) under 8 shared
   socio-economic pathway (SSP) greenhouse gas emission scenarios.
   Evaluation of model performance was implemented by repeatedly omitting 5
   successive years in turn for estimating testing errors. The outcomes
   indicate the high applicability of well-calibrated transfer functions,
   even for high quantiles, to the production of future rainfall scenarios.
   The projected changes in annual rainfall and absolute extremes were
   obtained by estimating multi-model medians from CMIP6 models for future
   periods (i.e. 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100), with
   reference to the base period (1995-2014). In general, annual rainfall in
   Ho Chi Minh City is projected to increase substantially, and Thu Duc
   station consistently shows the highest increases in annual rainfall.
   Projected changes are approximately 30.9\% (8.3 to 77.8\%) under the
   high-end scenario (i.e. SSP5-8.5) by the end of the 21st century. It is
   expected that these findings will yield several solid arguments for
   mitigating climate-related risks in Ho Chi Minh City.},

Abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of drought is crucial for
   planning, disaster preparedness, vulnerability assessment, impact
   evaluation, and policy formulation to mitigate drought-induced effects.
   The purpose of this study was to assess rainfall trends and
   spatiotemporal patterns of meteorological drought using geospatial
   techniques in Menna watershed. The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
   Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall, and station-based
   observed rainfall were the datasets used. The station-based rainfall was
   used to confirm the accuracy of CHIRPS rainfall data. The Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test and Sen ` s slope estimator were utilized to assess trends and
   ascertain the extent of change. To characterize meteorological droughts,
   percent of normal (PN), standardized anomaly index (SAI), and
   standardized precipitation index (SPI) were computed during the crop
   growing seasons (2000 - 2022). The validation result confirmed a strong
   agreement between the observed and CHIRPS rainfall data (R2 = 0.88).
   Based on the MK test, an increasing trend has been observed in annual
   (3.7 mm/year) and belg (3.4 mm/year) rainfall, which was significant at
   p < 0.05. But the kiremt season was slightly decreasing (-0.7 mm/year).
   The PN, SAI, and SPI values detected that 2002, 2004, 2009, 2011, 2014,
   2015, and 2019 were drought years in the area. Even only 1.4, 0.2, and
   0.5\% of the watershed were free from drought in 2009, 2014, and 2015,
   respectively, due to extremely high rainfall deficiency. Conversely,
   2001, 2010, and 2016 were notable for having the highest amounts of
   rainfall compared to the other years. Generally, the region could be
   classified as an area highly susceptible to meteorological drought in
   northwestern Ethiopia. There was no even a single year free from drought
   in the entire study period. To that extent, about 86\% of it had
   repeatedly encountered extreme rainfall deficit (7 - 23 times) during
   the study period. Thus, the population has always been repeatedly
   smashed down by the frequent droughts. To tackle existing challenges and
   mitigate upcoming risks, continual droughts monitoring and
   implementation of efficient early warning systems are vital for the
   region.},

Title = {Analyzing Rainfall Trends Using Statistical Methods across Vaippar
   Basin, Tamil Nadu, India: A Comprehensive Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Vaippar basin in southern India is economically important for
   rainfed and irrigated agriculture, mainly depending on the northeast
   monsoon (NEM) during October-December, and any changes in rainfall
   patterns directly affect crop ecosystems. This study aimed to analyze
   spatio-temporal rainfall changes using the monthly data from 13
   scattered rain gauge stations in the Vaippar basin, India. They were
   converted into gridded rainfall data by creating 26 equally spaced grids
   with a spacing of 0.125 degrees x 0.125 degrees for the period between
   1971 and 2019 through interpolation technique. Three methods, namely
   Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Mann-Kendell/modified Mann-Kendell
   (MK/MMK), and Sen's Innovation trend analysis (ITA), were employed to
   detect trends and magnitudes for annual and seasonal gridded rainfall
   series. The results showed significant trends at 2.3\%, 7.7\%, and
   44.6\% of grid points using SLR, MK/MMK, and ITA methods, respectively.
   Notably, ITA analysis revealed significant trends in annual and NEM
   rainfall at 57.69\% and 76.92\% of the grid points, respectively, at a
   5\% significance level. The southwestern and central parts of the basin
   exhibited a higher number of significant upward trends in annual
   rainfall. Similarly for the NEM season, the south-eastern, central, and
   extreme southern parts experienced significant upward trend. The western
   part of the basin exhibited significantly upward trend with a slope
   value of 2.03 mm/year, while the central part showed non-significant
   downward trend with a slope value of -1.89 mm/year for the NEM series.
   This study used the advantage of ITA method, allowing for exploration of
   monotonic/non-monotonic trends, as well as subtrends of low, medium, and
   high rainfall segments within the series. The key findings of this study
   serve as a scientific report from a policy perspective, aiding in the
   preparation and management of extreme climate effects on land and water
   resources in the Vaipaar basin.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {302},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The West Coast of India (WCI) and the West Coast of Myanmar (WCM)
   receive a good amount of monsoon rainfall due to the orographic lifting
   and moisture transport from the neighbouring sea. Here, diurnal
   variation in rainfall amount, frequency, intensity, and contribution
   during the summer monsoon period was studied using TRMM 3 hourly
   precipitation data. The analysis was carried out over lowland, midland
   and highland regions of both the coasts. The subregions exhibit a
   similar diurnal pattern even though the intensity and frequency of
   rainfall vary from region to region. Generally, bimodal variations with
   late afternoon and early morning peaks are found over lowland and
   midland regions of both WCI and WCM in rainfall frequency, amount and
   contribution. However, highland regions exhibit unimodal variation with
   a single late afternoon peak. Over WCI, lowland regions exhibit primary
   peak during early morning, whereas lowlands of WCM exhibit primary peak
   during afternoon hours. Rainfall intensity exhibits a different pattern
   compared to other parameters. Rainfall intensity increases from south to
   north over both the coasts. Among the subregions, maximum rainfall
   intensity is found over midlands and minimum over highlands. In general,
   more rainfall is observed over subregions of WCM than subregions of WCI.
   Most of the lowland and midland regions, exhibit a significant
   increasing trend in rainfall frequency and contribution at morning hours
   and a significant decreasing trend at afternoon hours. Rainfall
   frequency exhibit different periodicities during different time
   indicating interannual heterogeneity in rainfall. The diurnal pattern of
   summer monsoon rainfall over the Indian and Myanmar West coasts shows
   remarkable latitudinal and topographical variations.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on evaluating the High-Resolution Model
   Inter-comparison Project (HighResMIP), Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
   Project (AMIP), and Coupled Model simulations within the framework of
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Phase 6 (CMIP6). We
   used fifteen Models to explore how CMIP6 reproduced the June-September
   (JJAS) precipitation features over the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA)
   during the 1979-2014 historical simulation periods. Rainfall from the
   Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) and Climatic Research
   Unit (CRU) are used to validate the model simulations. Overall, the AMIP
   multi-model ensemble mean (MME) is able to reproduce the observed
   seasonal mean, the annual cycle, the frequency distribution of
   cumulative rainfall, spatial and trend patterns of precipitation over
   GHA. Particularly, long-term mean of JJAS season precipitation is well
   reproduced over the western part of Sudan Republic, much of South Sudan,
   over some isolated parts of north-western Uganda, Ethiopian Highlands,
   and western Ethiopia. However, consistent with previous studies, coupled
   models MME shows substantial discrepancies compared to AMIP in
   simulating JJAS rainfall climatology by exhibiting dry bias relative to
   both GPCC and CRU rainfall. In contrast, the HighresMIP experiments
   reveal wet bias over most parts of the GHA. The annual cycles of
   observed rainfall are well captured in AMIP, CMIP, and HighresMIP
   experiments and with further improvement in MMEs mean. In addition, the
   spatial rainfall pattern correlation between GPCC (CRU) and model
   simulations is as high as 0.89 (0.94), whereas the maximum trend pattern
   correlation is 0.47(0.72) with GPCC (CRU) respectively. Employing a
   multicriteria decision-making algorithm (MCDM) based on eight
   performance metrics as the selection criterion, we identified four,
   three, and two models and their MMEs out of AMIP, CMIP, and HighresMIP
   experiments, respectively, having superior skills over Ethiopian
   Highlands. In contrast, the study shows substantial biases in a number
   of models from AMIP, CMIP and HighresMIP experiments over GHA relative
   to GPCC and CRU observations that need to be improved with either bias
   correction or through further tuning of the models to improve their
   skills.},

Abstract = {Climate change has a profound effect on Arctic meteorology extreme
   events, such as rain-on-snow (ROS), which affects surface state variable
   spatial and temporal variability. Passive microwave satellite images can
   help detect such events in polar regions where local meteorological and
   snow information is scarce. In this study, we use a detection algorithm
   using high-resolution passive microwave data to monitor spatial and
   temporal variability of ROS over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from
   1987 to 2019. The method is validated using data from several
   meteorological stations and atmospheric corrections have been applied to
   the passive microwave dataset. Our approach to detect ROS is based on
   two methods: 1) over a fixed time period (i.e., 1 November-31 May)
   throughout the study period and 2) using an a priori detection for snow
   presence before applying our ROS algorithm (i.e., length of studied
   winter varies yearly). Event occurrence is analyzed for each winter and
   separated by island groups of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Results
   show an increase in absolute ROS occurrence, mainly along the coasts,
   although no statistically significant trends are observed.},

Title = {The recent trends in the Indian summer monsoon rainfall},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 31},
Abstract = {India gets maximum rain during the summer months of June through
   September, called Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR). The
   increasing/decreasing trend of ISMR affects millions of
   agriculture-dependent people in India. The spatial deviation of
   long-term ISMR trends indicates the monsoon circulation shift and should
   be minutely observed. The current study has observed that the ISMR has
   statistically significantly increased/decreased in western/eastern India
   in the last four decades. The significance of these trends is checked by
   evaluating the incomplete beta function used as a p-Value calculator for
   the Student t-test. In the meantime, the Indian Ocean has become more
   active due to its recent warming. The warming of the equatorial Indian
   Ocean has increased the in-situ convection south of the equatorial
   Indian Ocean, whose subsidising Hadley's branches has increased the
   upper-tropospheric geopotential height (GPH) in northern Europe and
   southern Africa. The north Europe GPH is associated with the Eurasian
   wave having massive ridges over eastern Europe and east Asia sandwiched
   with a trough east of the Caspian Sea. The penetration of this trough
   towards the Indian landmass has created favourable conditions for deep
   convection. Besides, the southern African GPH increases the
   cross-equatorial flow, which interacts with the mid-tropospheric trough
   over the Arabian Sea, increasing the moisture flow/convergence over
   western India. The interaction of the cross-equatorial flow with the
   upper-tropospheric penetrated trough through the Indian landmass
   increases the moist static energy, which results in heavy rainfall over
   west India and causes a shift of monsoon westward. This teleconnection
   could further be examined in the seasonal forecast models.},

Abstract = {Accurate and in-depth rainfall studies are crucial for understanding and
   assessing precipitation events' patterns, intensities, and impacts,
   enabling effective planning and management of water resources,
   agriculture, and disaster preparedness. Despite many rainfall studies in
   Bangladesh at the national and regional scales, study on the
   spatiotemporal rainfall variability is still rare at the local scale.
   The current study aims to apply Mann-Kendall (MK), Modified Mann-Kendall
   (MMK), and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) techniques to assess the
   long-term annual and seasonal rainfall trends and variability over the
   southeast region of Bangladesh. Monthly rainfall data from ten
   Bangladesh Meteorological Department climate stations between 1981 and
   2022 was used for the analysis on annual and four seasonal scales. The
   precipitation concentration index results showed significant variations
   in annual rainfall across the study area, whereas seasonal PCIs were
   consistent with moderate rainfall. According to standardized rainfall
   anomaly findings, each station experienced at least one severe to
   extremely severe drought episode during the 42-year study period.
   Homogeneity tests revealed significant breakpoints in some rainfall
   datasets, while 78\% were declared homogeneous. MK, MMK, and ITA
   techniques revealed similar increasing and decreasing trend patterns
   throughout the study area. Annual rainfall showed an upward trend in the
   coastal part and a downward trend in the northern part of the study
   area, with monsoon rainfall exhibiting a similar trend pattern. The ITA
   technique outperformed the MK and MMK techniques in detecting trends,
   identifying significant increasing and decreasing trends in 76\% (38 out
   of 50) of the observations, while the MK and MMK techniques detected
   trends in only 8\% and 44\% of the total observations, respectively. The
   outcome of the current study is expected to be helpful for the
   sustainable planning and management of water resources in the southeast
   region of Bangladesh.},

Title = {Observed decreasing trend in pan evaporation in a tropical rainforest
   region during 1959-2021},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Pan evaporation (E-pan) is a critical measure of the atmospheric
   evaporation demand. Analyzing meteorological data from the Tropical
   Rainforest Comprehensive Meteorological Observation Field in the
   Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG Meteorological Observing
   Station) based on physical models is helpful to improve our
   understanding of the state of the hydrological cycle in the
   Xishuangbanna tropical rainforest region. In this study, we investigated
   the long-term trend in E-pan using the observation data from 1959 to
   2021. Moreover, correlation analyses of E-pan were performed, such as
   trend test, assessment of periodic properties and abrupt change
   analysis. Then, D20 E-pan data and related meteorological data from 1979
   to 2008 were used to drive Penman-Monteith and PenPan models for
   simulating E-pan. The partial derivative attribution method was used to
   analyze the dominant factors affecting E-pan. The results showed that
   E-pan exhibits obvious periodic changes, the 19a is the first primary
   period. In addition, there was a clear `evaporation paradox' phenomenon
   in Xishuangbanna. E-pan showed a decreasing trend during both 1959-2008
   and 2009-2018, and the decreasing trend reached a significant level with
   a rate of -3.404 mm<middle dot>a(-2) during 1959-2008. Through
   comparative analysis, the PenPan model was considered more suitable for
   simulating E-pan in Xishuangbanna. In order to identify the main
   meteorological factors influencing E-pan, complete data from the D20 pan
   monitoring period, namely, 1979-2008, were selected for attribution
   calculations. The variations in the net radiation and saturated vapor
   pressure deficit are the main triggers that explain the `evaporation
   paradox' phenomenon in Xishuangbanna.},

   Analysis of Trends and Variability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {61-76},
Abstract = {The study used data from 11 taluks to analyse the changes and
   variability in annual and seasonal rainfall in the Kalaburagi district
   between 2016 and 2022. Sen Slope and Mann-Kendall analyses were used to
   evaluate trends, while the coefficient of variation was used to measure
   rainfall variability. The mean rainfall was calculated using simple
   mathematical formulas. The findings showed minimal seasonal and yearly
   variability, with the exception of the southwest monsoon season. The
   district as a whole as well as all 11 taluks consistently saw a rise in
   rainfall, according to annual Sen slope research. However, during the
   northeast monsoon season, negative trends were observed in Aland and
   Sedam Taluks. In the Mann-Kendall test, the district did not exhibit any
   general pattern; nevertheless, several taluks, such as Yadrami and
   Kamalapur, demonstrated remarkable trends in the southwest and northeast
   seasons, respectively. Due to geographical and climatic fluctuations,
   the district of Kalaburagi experienced an annual mean precipitation of
   797 mm. Higher mean rainfall was recorded in Sedam, Kalagi, Chincholi,
   and Kamalapur, while lower mean rainfall was recorded in Jevaragi and
   Yadrami Taluks. In the water-scarce Kalaburagi district, this work is
   important for policymakers addressing climate change and water resource
   management.},

Title = {Occurrence and trends of historical tropical cyclone rainfall on
   near-coastal regions of Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE EARTH SYSTEMS SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Extreme rainfall driven by tropical cyclones (TCs) has profound effects
   on Australian coastlines at both local and regional scales. Here, we
   develop methods for comparing TC-driven widespread and localised
   rainfall on three broad coastal regions of tropical Australia (west,
   north and east). Trends, average recurrence intervals (ARIs) and the
   fractional contribution of TC rainfall are explored in three historical
   datasets: Australian Gridded Climate Data (AGCD), ECMWF Reanalysis (ver.
   5, ERA5) and the Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high resolution
   Regional Reanalysis for Australia (ver. 1, BARRA1). Results for trends
   and ARIs between the different datasets are generally inconsistent and
   also differ between regions, partially owing to the short-term temporal
   records of some of the data as well as inconsistencies in extreme values
   between datasets. By contrast, there is a general agreement between all
   datasets on the fractional contribution of TC rainfall, signalling an
   increase in recent years. This result is considered together with the
   trend towards fewer TCs occurring in this region over recent decades,
   indicating a trend towards increased rainfall intensity per TC on
   average, assuming steady landfall rates. The methods developed here can
   be applied easily to other data types such as regional climate model
   experiments, facilitating a multiple lines of evidence approach that
   incorporates both observational-based and model-based data. This
   research is intended to help provide new methods and guidance for
   identifying trends in TC-driven extreme rainfall, relevant for enhanced
   planning and adaptation to the impacts of these extreme weather systems.
   The impacts of tropical cyclone rainfall on the northern coastlines of
   Australia can be severe. Trends for widespread and localised cyclone
   rainfall are examined in this paper in three historical datasets using
   innovative methods. There was a general disagreement in trends and
   average recurrence interval for the different measures of cyclone
   rainfall between datasets. By contrast, an increase in the fractional
   contribution of cyclone rainfall was more consistent between datasets,
   particularly over the north-western coastal region of Australia.},

Abstract = {With favorable environmental conditions and the adoption of new
   technologies, Turkiye has 1703 enterprises producing trout as of 2022.
   These enterprises collectively produce 167,286 tons of trout per year,
   including portioned fish (200-250 g), fillet candidates (400-600 g), and
   fillets (known as Turkish Salmon) (>3000 g). The production chain for
   Turkish Salmon involves hatcheries, dam lake net cage systems, and
   offshore net cage systems. There are 680 hatcheries producing trout eggs
   and fry, with a total annual production of 1,360,029,485 eggs.
   Additionally, 622 pond/dam lake net cage systems are used for producing
   Turkish Salmon candidates weighing 400-600 g, with a total production
   capacity of 163,525,079 kg per year. Offshore net cage systems in the
   Black Sea region, spread across six provinces, are utilized for Turkish
   Salmon production. Production planning is underway for two provinces,
   with a total planned production area of 15,650,000 m(2) and a projected
   capacity of 221,188,000 kg per year. Turkiye is actively involved in the
   global aquaculture sector, paying close attention to its advancements.
   Turkiye has a strong egg/juvenile production capacity compared to other
   countries involved in trout production globally. However, the
   importation of biotechnology-applied and observed eggs continues, posing
   biological and genetic risks to Turkiye's natural aquatic areas. Over
   the past 20 years, Turkiye's trout production has grown significantly,
   reaching 167,286 tons per year, marking it as a significant food
   production industry. This success can be attributed to favorable
   environmental conditions, increasing consumer demand, the adoption of
   new technologies, and consistent investments. However, the rapid growth
   in the trout farming sector over the past five years has led to an
   uncontrollable decline in survival rates. This decline can be attributed
   to the spread of diseases, incorrect treatment methods, improper
   breeding management practices, flawed business management, unregulated
   fish transport, and compromised sanitary and environmental conditions.},

Title = {Response of Sap Flow Trends of Conifer and Broad-Leaved Trees to
   Rainfall Types in Sub-Humid Climate Region of China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Sap flow is one of the most important physiological water transport
   processes of trees, and the characteristics of sap flow are greatly
   affected by the spatial and temporal distribution of water in the SPAC
   (soil-plant-atmosphere continuum). However, different precipitation
   characteristics have great influence on the water environment of forest
   trees, which causes considerable differences in sap flow. Therefore,
   researching the response of sap flow to precipitation type is the key to
   accurately determining plant transpiration in semi-arid areas. We used
   K-means clustering analysis to divide the rainfall during the study
   period into three rainfall types (the highest rainfall amount and
   intensity (types I), medium rainfall amount and intensity, with a long
   duration (types II); and the lowest rainfall amount and intensity (types
   III)) based on the rainfall amount and intensity in order to compare the
   differences in the response of sap flow trends and influencing factors
   of Pinus tabulaeformis and Robinia pseudoacacia under different rainfall
   types. The results showed that, under the daily scale average sap flow
   of P. tabulaeformis and R. pseudoacacia, rainfall type II decreased
   significantly relatively to rainfall types I and III (p < 0.05). In
   rainfall type II, The sap flow characteristics of R. pseudoacacia were
   positively correlated with solar radiation (p < 0.05), while those of P.
   tabulaeformis were positively correlated with temperature, solar
   radiation, and VPD (p < 0.01). The sap flow of P. tabulaeformis and R.
   pseudoacacia were significantly positively correlated with temperature,
   solar radiation, VPD, and soil moisture content (p < 0.01) and
   negatively correlated with relative humidity (p < 0.05) in rainfall type
   III. The hourly sap flow of P. tabulaeformis and R. pseudoacacia on
   rainfall days was higher than before the rainfall. Rainfall type I
   promoted the daily sap flow of both species, and the proportion of the
   sap flow in daytime was also higher. On rainy days, the sap flow rates
   of rainfall type I and III showed a ``midday depression{''}. In type I
   rainfall events, the sap flow ``midday depression{''} after rainfall
   occurred an hour ahead compared to the sap flow ``midday depression{''}
   before rainfall. In type II rainfall events, the daytime sap flow rates
   of P. tabulaeformis and R. pseudoacacia were obviously inhibited, but
   the nighttime sap flow rate increased. In type III rainfall events, the
   sap flow before rainfall presented a unimodal curve versus time. The
   daily average sap flow of R. pseudoacacia was more susceptible to
   rainfall type II, while P. tabulaeformis was more susceptible to
   rainfall types I and III. The sap flow rate of R. pseudoacacia decreased
   on rainy days. The results show that the effects of different rainfall
   types on the sap flow trends of P. tabulaeformis and R. pseudoacacia
   were different. They revealed the responses of their sap flow trends to
   meteorological factors under different rainfall types, which provided
   basic data and theoretical support for further predicting the sap flow
   trends on rainy days, clarifying the effects of rainfall amount,
   rainfall duration, and rainfall intensity on sap flow trends and
   accurately estimating the transpiration water consumption of typical
   tree species in the sub-humid climate regions of China.},

Title = {Climate projection and future rainfall trends analysis in the Nouhao
   sub-basin in Burkina Faso},
Journal = {GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},

Number = {3},
Abstract = {Climate change is an indicator of changes happening in the biosphere.
   Monitoring it, will anticipating actions against the resulting
   disasters. This study, undertaken in Burkina Faso Nouaho sub basin,
   gives an overview of rainfall in the near, medium and long terms. It is
   built on regional climates models which are climates projections from
   global climate models downscaling. These models are generated basis on
   scenarios like greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing called
   Regional Concentration Pathways (RCP). The two scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP
   8.5 chosen in this study, have enabled to identify a rainfall regional
   climate model whose output corrected basis on Nouhao sub -basin
   observation data, highlight changes in sub -basin future precipitation.
   Over the three defined normal, i.e. normal 1 (2021-2050), normal 2
   (2051-2080) and normal 3 (20712100), cumulative annual rainfall mean
   shows a downward trend under the RCP 4.5 scenario, and an upward trend
   under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
   for the RCP 4.5 scenario shows very wet years at the start of normal 1,
   before giving way to alternating years close to normal rainfall, in
   normal 2 and 3. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, the SPI shows a dominance of
   dry years in normal 1. In normal 2 and 3, wet and very wet years return
   to dominate. The spatial dynamics of future rainfall, meanwhile, show a
   latitudinal shift in annual rainfall totals towards the south -east of
   the sub -basin under the RCP 4.5 scenario, and towards the north-west
   under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The climate projection thus highlights
   possible future changes in precipitation in the sub -basin. Its
   consideration could form the basis for the implementation of climate
   change adaptation strategies in the area.},

Journal = {ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {73-81},
Abstract = {District Giridih is primarily rain dependent on its 95 per cent net
   cultivable land under summer-monsoon crops. It is classified as a
   mono-cropping area as it lacks irrigation facilities, essential for
   winter crops. In the last few years, the district experienced water
   stress due to the shortage of monsoon rainfall. We study long term
   seasonal and annual rainfall trend analyses for the Giridih district of
   Jharkhand in India using linear regression modelling. The last 100 years
   of data were taken for the study and were divided into two-time phases
   of 50 years each to analyse the changing pattern of rainfall trends. We
   found a decreasing trend in monsoon rainfall from 1 mm y(-1) to 3 mm
   y(-1) between the initial (1921-1971) and final (1972-2021) phase of the
   study period. Similarly, the return period of droughts (rainfall deficit
   years) has also reduced from 11 years to 5 years. The study has shown
   that the rainfall pattern has changed, with the winter months showing a
   decrease and the pre-monsoon months an increase in their relative
   contributions to the annual rainfalls. The study may help in the
   formulation of water resource conservation-oriented decision-making to
   cope-up with the rainfall uncertainties and meet the future water
   demand.},

Pages = {287-303},
Abstract = {Full comprehension of precipitation patterns is crucially needed,
   especially in Pekan, a district in Pahang, Malaysia. The area is
   renowned for its elevated levels of precipitation, making it imperative
   to precisely categorize and enhance the analysis of rainfall patterns to
   facilitate effective resource allocation, agricultural productivity, and
   catastrophe readiness. The variability of rainfall patterns is
   contingent upon geographical location, necessitating the collection of a
   comprehensive data set that includes several characteristics that
   influence precipitation to make reliable predictions. Data were
   collected from the Vantage Pro2 weather station, which is located on the
   UMP Pekan campus. This study used the RT method to classify rainfall and
   T-Method 1 to determine the degree of contribution of each parameter.
   Significant parameters were validated using a data set from the same
   type of weather station but in a different district. The results showed
   that the Mahalanobis-Taguchi Bee Algorithm (MTBA) is more effective than
   the Mahalanobis-Taguchi System (MTS) in finding the significant
   parameters, but the parameters were a subset of MTS Teshima. Finally,
   the validation with T mean-based error (Tmbe) using Mean Absolute Error
   (MAE) revealed a pattern of errors to provide insight to find the
   significant parameters of MTS.},

Title = {Recent trends in extratropical lows and their rainfall over Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE EARTH SYSTEMS SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Low pressure systems are an important source of rainfall in southern
   Australia, particularly deep lows that extend from the surface to at
   least 500 hPa. This paper uses multiple reanalyses to assess long-term
   trends in lows over the period 1959-2023, and identifies statistically
   significant decreasing trends in the number of surface low pressure
   systems near southern Australia during May-October, linked to a decrease
   in cyclogenesis near south-western Western Australia. Trends in lows at
   500 hPa are also negative but weaker than at the surface, and are less
   consistent between reanalyses owing to less consistent observations
   through time. The spatial pattern of observed declines during the cool
   season is consistent with trends using eight CMIP6 models, but global
   climate models systematically underestimate the magnitude of the
   observed decline in surface lows. Trends in rainfall associated with
   lows are also shown, including assessing the sensitivity of trends to
   the specific years used. Despite well above average numbers of lows and
   enhanced rainfall during recent La Ni \& ntilde;a years 2020-2022, total
   rainfall from low pressure systems is declining during the cool season
   in south-east Australia. Trends in rainfall from lows are largest on the
   east coast, where they explain more than 70\% of observed rainfall
   changes since the 1960s.
   Extratropical lows and east coast lows cause a large proportion of
   rainfall in southern Australia during the months May-October. Their
   frequency varies from year to year, but new data show that they have
   been becoming less common in recent decades compared to the 1960s. This
   is contributing to decreases in cool season rainfall in southern

Title = {Rainfall trend analysis in Gujarat's semi-arid zone: a modified approach
   with autocorrelation consideration},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Precise identification of rainfall movement is very essential during
   climate change scenarios for better water resources management. Erratic
   and violent monsoon rainfall movements are observed in the coastal
   region of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Kerala within a very short period.
   The aim of the research is to identify the changes that occurred in the
   South-West monsoon rainfall trend using advance statistical package of
   R-software, for the semi-arid region of Gujarat. From the Wallis and
   Moore phase-frequency test, it is found that 6 out of 29 stations are
   having significant autocorrelation. Modified Mann-Kendall and Sen's
   slope tests are used to carry out rainfall trend analysis. Spatial
   representation of mean SW-monsoon rainfall and Sen's slope shows lower
   magnitude near coastal region and higher magnitude at higher elevation
   range. As a result, it is concluded that in monsoon two stations (7\%)
   and particularly during June month seven (24\%) stations are showing a
   significantly decreasing trend.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal trends of mercury levels in alluvial gold mining spoils
   areas monitored between rainy and dry seasons in the Peruvian Amazon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {245},

Abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Amazon has degraded
   tropical forests and escalated mercury (Hg) pollution, affecting
   biodiversity, ecological processes and rural livelihoods. In the
   Peruvian Amazon, ASGM annually releases some 181 tons of Hg into the
   environment. Despite some recent advances in understanding the spatial
   distribution of Hg within gold mine spoils and the surrounding
   landscape, temporal dynamics in Hg movement are not well understood. We
   aimed to reveal spatio-temporal trends of soil Hg in areas degraded by
   ASGM.,. We analyzed soil and sediment samples during the dry and rainy
   seasons across 14 ha of potentially contaminated sites and natural
   forests, in the vicinities of the Native community of San Jacinto in
   Madre de Dios, Peru. Soil Hg levels of areas impacted by ASGM (0.02 +/-
   0.02 mg kg-1) were generally below soil environmental quality standards
   (6.60 mg kg-1). However, they showed high variability, mainly explained
   by the type of natural cover vegetation, soil organic matter (SOM), clay
   and sand particles. Temporal trends in Hg levels in soils between
   seasons differed between landscape units distinguished in the mine
   spoils. During the rainy season, Hg levels decreased up to 45.5\% in
   uncovered soils, while in artificial pond sediments Hg increased by up
   to 961\%. During the dry season, uncovered degraded soils were more
   prone to lose Hg than sites covered by vegetation, mainly due to higher
   soil temperatures and concomitantly increasing volatilization. Soils
   from natural forests and degraded soil covered by regenerating
   vegetation showed a high capacity to retain Hg mainly due to the higher
   plant biomass, higher SOM, and increasing concentrations of clay
   particles. Disturbingly, our findings suggest high Hg mobility from gold
   mine spoil to close by sedimentary materials, mainly in artificial ponds
   through alluvial deposition and pluvial lixiviation. Thus, further
   research is needed on monitoring, and remediation of sediments in
   artificial to design sustainable land use strategies. findings suggest

Title = {Implications of rainfall variability on groundwater recharge and
   sustainable management in South Asian capitals: An in-depth analysis
   using Mann Kendall tests, continuous wavelet coherence, and innovative
   trend analysis},
Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Groundwater resources, a critical component of hydrogeological systems,
   are under increasing pressure due to climate change and anthropogenic
   activities. South Asia, a region highly vulnerable to climate shocks,
   has seen over half of its population affected by climate-related
   disasters in the past two decades. These climate changes, characterized
   by intensifying heat waves, cyclones, droughts, and flooding, pose
   significant risks to groundwater resources management. This study aimed
   to address the recent variability, intensity, and depth of rainfall
   patterns in the capitals of south Asian countries on a daily, monthly,
   and annual basis. Mann-Kendal tests (MKT), Innovative Trend Analysis
   (ITA), and Continuous Wavelet Coherence were conducted to identify trend
   patterns. The Gumbel distribution of Intensity Depth Frequency (IDF)
   analysis was performed to analyze the depth and intensity of rainfall
   patterns for rainfall durations of 5, 10, 15, 30 min, 1-hr, 2-hr, 12-hr
   and 24-hr for 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 years return periods. Results
   of ITA and MKT showed similar trend results for all cities and time
   scales. Findings suggest that Kotte receives the highest annual rainfall
   of 1745.28 mm and Kabul the lowest (380.76 mm). MKT showed both positive
   and negative monthly trends in most of the months, while annual rainfall
   exhibited positive trends in all cities with a change rate between +0.56
   and + 2.34 mm/year. Seasonal trend analysis confirms positive trends for
   all seasons, except in Delhi, Male `, and Kathmandu in winter. IDF
   analysis reveals that current rainfall trends will slightly affect the
   depth and intensity of rainfall events for the various return periods.
   The study provides valuable insights into the water-energy-food nexus
   and contributes to the broader discourse on water policy and social
   aspects of groundwater in the face of climate change.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is the key weather element which regulates the hydrological
   cycle, availability of water resources and crop production. In this
   study, spatial and temporal variability of rainfall has been
   investigated on seasonal and annual time scales of 149 blocks of
   Chhattisgarh State using 120 years (1901-2020) of rainfall data.
   Non-parametric, and Theil and Sen's slope estimator were used to
   identify possible trends and ascertain the variability in the magnitude.
   The results revealed that there exists a well-marked spatial variability
   in rainfall over Chhattisgarh in annual and seasonal time scales. Out of
   149 blocks a significant negative rainfall was noticed in 105 blocks.
   Annual rainfall showed a significant positive trend in a few blocks like
   Bhopalpattnam, Bijapur, Usur, Konta. A similar pattern of trend was
   noticed in monsoon season. The results of the study demand the urgent
   need to formulate policies and strategies for water resource management
   and planning. The blocks which showed the positive rainfall trends can
   be identified to intensify the cultivation of more water requiring crops
   based on the suitability to that region. The findings of this study can
   be used as valuable information for crop planning, policy-making and
   preparation of contingency plans. HIGHLIGHTS center dot Significant

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the existence and the magnitude
   of trend in different areas and durations of TCR. To achieve this
   objective, a mixed-method approach was employed using
   depth-area-duration and areal reduction factor (ARFs) curves that can be
   described as a logarithm equation to generate time series that allows
   the application of statistical methods such as the Mann-Kendall (MK) and
   Spearman Rho (SR) to detect trends. Time series are generated by
   substituting different areas in the logarithmic equations. The evidence
   presented shows that in Mexico, the TCR lasting 24 h shows an increasing
   trend for maximum areas between 300 and 1,700 km2 according to the MK
   and SR tests, respectively; according to these same tests for durations
   of 48 h, upward trends were observed up to maximum areas between 5,700
   and 6,900 km2. The Sen slope reports annual increases between 0.76 and
   1.32 mm and between 1.15 and 2.06 for a duration of 24 and 48 h,
   respectively. In contrast, no trends were observed in the time series
   obtained from the ARFs. Finally, the Pettitt test reports an abrupt jump
   from the year 1997 in all cases.},

Abstract = {In time-series analysis, several non-parametric and parametric
   techniques are available to identify a trend. However, due to the lesser
   sensitivity of the non-parametric methods towards the outliers, they are
   often given priority over parametric methods for analysing the trend. In
   this study, the significance of the trend in the rainfall data of the
   four cities: Guwahati, Tezpur, North Lakhimpur, and Dibrugarh in Assam
   is examined using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall method. The
   non-parametric Sen's estimator method is used to estimate the magnitude
   of the significant trends for the four cities. The rainfall trend has
   been studied based on monthly, yearly, and seasonal observations. The
   results clearly show that there is no trend in the cities except for
   Dibrugarh, where an increasing rainfall trend is observed within 5\%
   significance level. Based on the seasonal rainfall analysis, it is noted
   that the pre- and post-monsoon precipitation has a significant
   increasing trend, while no trend is seen during the monsoon period,
   which indicates an absence of significant change in the rainfall
   magnitude during the monsoon for the study period. The analysis of the
   monthly rainfall data has reveal a significant trend for July in the
   cities of Guwahati and Tezpur, which are closely located, while the
   significant trend for May is seen in the city of North Lakhimpur.
   However, for Dibrugarh, all months have shown significant trends at 5\%
   except for September, November, and December. The analysis has shown
   that there is a significant change in the rainfall trend for the
   non-monsoon period, indicating the change in the rainfall pattern, while
   the overall trend for the monsoon period remains the same. This change
   of rainfall pattern during the non-monsoon period may be an impact of
   the climate change, which requires detailed studies. The overall
   analysis for the four sites over the period under review has shown a
   significant trend in rainfall only for Dibrugarh.},

Abstract = {The detection and monitoring of changes in land use and land cover play
   a crucial role in understanding land degradation and are fundamental to
   preserving agroecosystems. Their association with hydrological
   information allows essential responses to changes in hydrological
   patterns to be identified, contributing to water security in watersheds.
   Therefore, this study aimed to assess spatio-temporal dynamics and
   physico-hydrological trends in rainfall, runoff and land use in the Para
   \& iacute;ba watershed. The study was conducted in the Para \& iacute;ba
   watershed, using land use data and information from pluviometric and
   fluviometric stations with temporal series of more than 30 years. The
   Mann-Kendall statistical test was adopted to verify trends. Results
   indicate annual reduction trends for both native forest area and water
   bodies in the Para \& iacute;ba watershed. On the other hand, the area
   designated for agriculture showed a significant increase. The
   correlation analysis between water bodies and forests (R-2 = 0.63)
   highlights a strong association between the decrease in forest area and
   the reduction in water availability, influencing the decrease in annual
   flow. These results serve as a warning to expand water resource
   management for the region, aiming to preserve and to enhance sustainable
   use. Therefore, the implementation of conservation measures, monitoring
   procedures, and adequate management is required to face the challenges
   imposed by climate change and land use and occupation, ensuring the
   water availability for the future.},

Abstract = {Rainfall plays a very vital role and its deficit causes a huge impact on
   the environment. Understanding the pattern of rainfall and drought
   trends has become increasingly crucial in many regions due to climate
   change. In this study, using the rainfall data from 1958 to 2017 for
   thirty-four meteorological subdivisions of India, trend analysis is
   performed for annual and seasonal rainfall. Along with the rainfall
   trend analysis, the study is also performed for meteorological drought
   indices, i.e., Effective Drought Index (EDI), Standardized Precipitation
   Index-9 (SPI-9), and Standardized Precipitation Index-12 (SPI-12). The
   results obtained from the Mann-Kendall test show that the rainfall
   patterns in the area under investigation are changing over time. As
   evidenced by the decrease in rainfall, the study region has been
   experiencing a lack of water supply in numerous subdivisions. The
   drought frequency for the meteorological drought indices has also been
   investigated, and it has been observed that the region is experiencing
   drought from extremely dry conditions to normal dry conditions. The
   findings in this study will help us to better comprehend the changes in
   rainfall and drought severity over the study region. This study may also
   benefit effective disaster management and preparedness strategies for
   this catastrophe, which is wreaking havoc on the environment.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the trend analysis of groundwater level with reference to
   rainfall for a period from 1979 to 2022 has been carried out for the
   Thar district of Jaisalmer where the annual rainfall is the minimum in
   the state of Rajasthan. This area has not been researched for this kind
   of study earlier. Rainfall data have been collected from IMD (Indian
   Metrological Department) Pune whereas the groundwater data have been
   collected from CGWB (Central Ground Water Board, Govt. of India), GWD
   (Ground Water Department, Govt. of Rajasthan) and India-WRIS portal,
   Govt. of India. The collected data have been analysed in terms of
   fluctuations in groundwater level. Being located in the Thar Desert,
   Jaisalmer is the third largest and one of the hot districts in India
   where water availability plays a critical role. The statistical analysis
   has been performed by using Microsoft excel and XLSTAT statistical
   software in which Innovative trend analysis (ITA), Mann-Kendall Trend
   analysis Test (MK test) and Sen's slope estimator have been used. It has
   been observed that the yearly rainfall shows significantly upward trend
   (p < 0.05) during the study period whereas the groundwater level has
   significantly decreasing trend (p = 0.044) which indicates that
   groundwater level is rising. ITA support the results of MK test. The
   climatic and geological factors including unauthorized extraction of
   groundwater for irrigation purposes are also responsible for groundwater
   level fluctuation. In order to get the optimum out of the incident
   rainfall in the district, it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive
   study considering all relevant variables using advanced technology of
   assessment, measurement and extraction of groundwater, consumptive use
   of water, artificial recharge and regular monitoring at the level of
   local authorities in the field.},

Title = {Spatial Heterogeneity of Summer Rainfall Trends over the Tibetan Plateau
   Contributed by Different Rainfall Intensities},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent years have witnessed contrasting trends in summer total rainfall
   (STR) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), with an increase in the northern
   and a decrease in the southern TP. This study identifies four
   significant centers of rainfall trends: eastern TP ({''}region A{''}),
   Qiangtang Plateau ({''}B{''}), Qaidam Basin ({''}C{''}), and the
   northern foothills of the Himalayas ({''}D{''}). Heavy rainfall
   dominates STR trends in regions A and D, accounting for 55.6\% and
   52.0\%, respectively. In region B, moderate and light rainfall
   contribute almost equally, accounting for 37.3\% and 44.8\% of the STR
   trend, respectively. Region C is primarily influenced by light rainfall,
   explaining 71.2\% of the STR trend. Notably, the contributions of
   different rainfall intensities to STR in each region vary annually, with
   region A experiencing more heavy rainfall, region B having moderate
   dominance but less light rainfall, and region C and D showing reduced
   and increased light rainfall contributions, respectively.
   Mechanistically, the strengthening of the upper-level westerly jet and
   the South Asian High, coupled with changes in moisture transport and
   convective available potential energy, collectively cause variations in
   rainfall intensity, characterizing the spatial heterogeneity in STR in
   the TP.},

Abstract = {Southeastern South America (SESA) experienced some of the largest
   positive trends in total and extreme precipitation of the Southern
   Hemisphere during the last decades. The City of Buenos Aires, the second
   largest mega-city of SESA, has been particularly hard-hit by these
   trends due to its flat topography and poor natural drainage. Recent
   studies suggest that these precipitation extremes may exacerbate even
   further under global warming, but the physical mechanisms responsible
   for such events have not been documented for this region so far. This
   study quantifies the relative contributions of dynamics (atmospheric
   fronts) and thermodynamics (vertical stability) on the observed
   variations and trends of daily, seasonal and annual precipitation over
   the City of Buenos Aires between 1981 and 2020 by splitting the
   precipitation events into convective and stratiform. Results show that
   the relative contributions from dynamics and thermodynamics depend on
   the season under consideration: the positive trends in summer
   precipitation have been favoured by a net increase in vertical
   instability with a negligible contribution from dynamics, while the
   increased frequency of fronts in autumn and winter, when no changes in
   vertical instability have been observed, has contributed to the higher
   frequency of cold-season convective events.},

Abstract = {This study integrates purely statistical methods of Mann-Kendall (MK)
   and Spearman rho (SMR) with statistical-graphical methods of Onyutha
   trend (OT) test and innovative trend analysis (ITA) to examine annual
   and seasonal rainfall variations at 12 stations across the Shire River
   Basin (SRB) during 1976-2005. The results reveal a general decreasing
   trend for annual rainfall throughout the basin. At seasonal scale, the
   following trends were observed: an increase for the
   December-January-February (DJF) season, especially in the southern
   portion of the basin; a decrease for the March-April-May (MAM) and
   June-July-August (JJA) seasons; and inconclusive results for the
   September-October-November (SON) season. Despite nearly all time series
   indicating consistent trend direction as established by the four tests,
   the ITA identified the most significant rainfall patterns on both annual
   and seasonal basis. The performance abilities for the MK, SMR, and OT
   tests demonstrated the closest agreement at the verified significant
   level. In addition to the monotonic trend results obtained
   statistically, sub-trends are visually distinguished using the graphical
   features of the OT and ITA approaches. For the former, changes are seen
   as step jumps in the mean of the data, and for the latter, trends
   regarding high and low rainfall clusters are evaluated, hence offering
   more details regarding rainfall variability, such as the SRB's
   sensitivity to both floods and droughts. Thus, the completely different
   aspects offered by the visually oriented methods complement the purely
   monotonic trend detection methods.},

Abstract = {The article provides a long-term trend analysis of the Kesinga catchment
   daily gridded rainfall at a (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) high spatial
   resolution from 1901 to 2020 (120 years). The trend in seasonal and
   annual rainfall was detected using rank-based nonparametric statistical
   tests, namely Spearman's rho and Mann-Kendall test, which are used for
   detecting monotonic trends in time series data at the 5\% significant
   level, smoothing curve, Sen's slope test, and a plot of innovative trend
   analysis. The results showed that statistically significant trends had a
   pattern with both positive (increasing) and negative (decreasing)
   trends, with positive and negative trends evident in the winter and
   negative trends shown in the monsoon, PREMON, and annual seasons. The
   middle of the study area revealed the highest negative trend, and the
   lower Kesinga catchment showed the lowest negative annual rainfall
   trend. In the entire Kesinga catchment, the seasonal data and annual
   rainfall both showed statistically significant and non-significant
   patterns. Consistently, the MK and SR tests were both conducted at the
   validated significance level. In various contexts, the statistically
   significant massive trend that has occurred was negative (70\%). If the
   current pattern continues in the future, there will be a scarcity of
   water and more strain on the control of water resources at the given
   grids in corresponding temporal scales.},

Abstract = {There is insufficient paucity of information on trends in long-term
   monthly and decadal rainfall in Zambia. This study assessed the monthly
   and decadal trends in rainfall over the agro-ecological regions (AERs)
   and Zambia from 1981 to 2022. The Mann-Kendall test statistic was used
   at 5 \% significant level to compute trends in rainfall at monthly and
   decadal time step on CHIRPS v2 at 0.05 degrees resolution. R/RStudio
   Sen's slope estimator was used to give the magnitude of the observed
   trends. The monthly rainfall time series trend over Zambia ranges from
   -0.04 to 0.03. The decadal trend analysis of rainfall at annual and
   monthly time step exhibits a decreasing/ increasing trend with Sen's
   slope between -49.27 and 71.26 mm. Decadal trend at annual time step in
   AERIII, AERIIa, AERIIa and AERI exhibits a Sen's slope of -44.11 to
   62.48 mm, -15.29 to 41.58 mm, -6.08 and 71.26 mm, and 2.20-64.86 mm,
   respectively. The decadal trend at monthly time step in AERIII, AERIIa,
   AERIIa and AERI exhibits a Sen's slope of -132.08 to -3.15 mm, -123.39
   to -8.57 mm, -73.08 to -15.17 mm, and -80.02 to -5.21 mm, respectively.
   Decrease in rainfall is expected to affect agriculture, energy, water
   resources, sanitation and socioeconomic aspects. Rainfall pattern shows
   spatio-temporal variability over Zambia. The results provide valuable
   input into the National Adaptation Plan and also useful for strategic
   planning purposes in water resources management under a changing
   climate. It is evident that spatiotemporal time steps utilized in this
   study provides new insights of rainfall trends at seasonal, monthly, and
   annual and decadal time steps.},

Abstract = {Identifying the changes and effects of drought (as a natural creeping
   phenomenon) as accurately as possible is very effective and essential in
   managing how to deal with this phenomenon. To study drought in more
   detail, the main objective of this research is to consider the stability
   and changes of drought in different moving periods (MPs). These
   investigations were performed for various seasonal and annual time
   scales using rainfall values and reconnaissance drought index (RDI). The
   results showed sinusoidal changes in trend correlation coefficients
   (TCCs) for the 10-year MP, in which the wave amplitude became shorter
   and wavelength became longer as the MP lengthened. In recent MPs, the
   coefficient values of the trend were increasing. The RDI analysis showed
   that, in addition to the mentioned changes, the trend of autumn time
   scale changes in the 15- and 20-year MPs, especially after MP7, was the
   opposite of the change trend in other time scales, especially the winter
   time scale. According to the results, the values of P(N/N) were greater
   than the values of P(N/P), which showed the stability of the decreasing
   trend of rainfall and RDI changes in different MPs, especially at 10
   years.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate the trend behavior of monthly maximum in
   daily rainfall categories in the Vu Gia-Thu Bon river basin located in
   central Vietnam. Daily maximum rainfall series from 12 rainfall stations
   for the period 1979-2018 were utilized to characterize six categories of
   the intensity of daily maximum rainfall: light (0-4 mm/day, category A),
   mild-moderate (4-16 mm/day, category B), moderate-heavy (16-32 mm/day,
   category C-1), heavy (32-64 mm/day, category C-2), heavy-torrential
   (64-128 mm/day, category D-1), and torrential (>= 128 mm/day, category
   D-2). The new approach of the Innovative Trends Analysis was then
   applied to the six classified categories. The results revealed that
   category B had a dominant increasing trend (32\% of rain events) for all
   the stations in January (5.85\%) and February (3.44\%). In March and
   April, category A was dominant with 45\% and 20\%, respectively. In
   July, category C-1 was dominant with 25\%, while in August and
   September, category C-2 prevailed over all stations with 45\% (all
   stations) and 20\%, respectively. The categories D-1 and D-2 were
   observed at all stations in December and November, with 26\% and 31\% of
   events, respectively. These results indicate an increasing trend in the
   categories B, C-1, C-2, and D-1.},

Abstract = {This article examines the spatial variability of extreme precipitation
   trends in northwestern Algeria (Macta) and compares the results obtained
   from the four recent and old non-parametric methods. A dataset of annual
   maximum precipitation consisting of 41 observation years (1970-2010) and
   41 rain gauges was used. The results of the four old and new methods
   used to detect trends, Mann-Kendall (MK), Bravais-Pearson (BP), Spearman
   (SR) and innovative trend analysis (ITA), show good agreement. They
   revealed that a decrease in the trend of annual maximum precipitation
   was detected during the first period (1970-1992) with -44\% (MK), -61\%
   (BP), -68\% (SR) and -76\% (ITA). On the other hand, in the second
   period (1993-2010), a total shift occurred in which a significant
   increase in annual maximum precipitation trends was observed with +63\%
   (BP), +34\% (MK and SR) and +93\% (ITA). These results show the ability
   of ITA to detect partial trends that the other three tests do not allow.
   Our results allow decision-makers to properly design adaptation
   strategies in the face of the intensification of these extreme events.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this paper was to investigate the monthly, seasonal,
   and annual rainfall variability in the Mae Klong River Basin in Thailand
   using the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Sen's slope method, Spearman's Rho
   (SR) test, and the innovative trend analysis (ITA) method. The monthly
   rainfall data of eight stations for the period 1971-2015 were used for
   trend analysis. Datasets with significant serial correlation were
   corrected by the trend-free pre-whitening (TFPW) approach for
   statistical methods. The MK test showed increasing rainfall trends for
   five out of eight stations in the dry season while 50\% stations
   indicated increasing trends in the wet season. On an annual scale, 75\%
   of the stations exhibited increasing rainfall trends. The results of the
   SR test were in line with the MK test for seasonal and annual rainfall.
   The ITA method showed comparable findings with that of the statistical
   methods. For the entire basin, trend analysis found increasing rainfall
   on both seasonal and annual scales by all the tests. The findings of
   this study could benefit water supply and management, drought
   monitoring, agricultural production activities, and socioeconomic
   development in the Mae Klong River Basin in the future.},

Abstract = {Disasters caused by rainfall extremes represent social challenges in
   several sectors, especially in climate change scenarios. Along with
   changes in land use and land cover, this relationship may become more
   complex. Thus, the present study aimed to detect recent trends in the
   pattern of rainfall indicators and associate them with records of
   natural disasters and the evolution of changes in land use and land
   cover for the state of Espirito Santo, southeastern Brazil. Daily
   rainfall data from 77 rain gauge stations from 1970 to 2018 were used to
   analyze climate trends in different rainfall indicators obtained using
   the RClimDex software. Records of natural disasters from 1991 to 2020 in
   the state of Espirito Santo were gathered from the Brazilian Integrated
   Disaster Information System. Additionally, land use and land cover data
   from 1985 and 2019 were also used. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test and the
   Sen slope were used to detect and quantify trends. In the Litoral Norte
   Espirito-santense and Noroeste Espirito-santense mesoregions of the
   State, trends of drought intensification are expected mainly in the
   regions further north. Associated with the great recent agricultural
   expansion in the region, this trend is concerning. The Central
   Espirito-santense and Sul Espirito-santense mesoregions tend to become
   wetter, which explains the recent increase in floods and heavy rainfall.
   No significant trends were found in the other regions studied. The
   approach adopted in this study has the potential to assist
   decision-making, implement mitigation and/or adaptation measures, and
   reduce the impacts of natural disasters in different regions of the
   world.},

Abstract = {The study of rainfall trends is crucial for food security and water
   availability in Alagoas state, Northeast of Brazil. In this work,
   monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall trends have been studied
   (1960-2016) for homogeneous rainfall regions over the eastern part of
   the Northeast Brazil (ENEB) and later related to climate variability.
   Cluster analysis was applied to identify homogeneous rainfall regions
   while the Mann-Kendall (MK), modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) and Pettitt
   tests were used in the analysis and identification of trends on a
   spatial and temporal scale. To relate rainfall and climate variability
   modes, Spearman's correlation was used in each homogeneous region. The
   rainfall series provided evidence of a general decrease in rainfall in
   the rainy period and an increase in the dry period, mainly over the
   driest region. The break points of time series occurred mostly in
   periods of great variations in values of modes of climate variability,
   especially the Monthly Nino3.4 Index and the Southern Oscillation Index
   (SOI), both having a robust influence across the region. Moreover, the
   probable rainfall in the time series with trends was different in most
   months before and after the breakpoint. After the breakpoint, probable
   rainfall was lower, influenced by the breakpoint year (size of the
   series before and after the breakpoint), which mainly occurred in the
   1980s and 1990s and presented a warm phase and a greater number of El
   Nino events. The MK and MMK trend tests showed the ability to detect
   trends, although there is no established standard on which test or
   version to use due to self-correlated, nonhomogeneous series with
   nonrandom or nonindependent data. Rainfall is an important variable for
   water and food security and in the monitoring of natural disasters. The
   changes detected in this study can be used as reference information for
   public policies on water resources and future studies for Alagoas and
   similar regions.},

Abstract = {This study presents an analysis of long-term rainfall variability and
   trends in the summer monsoon region of Southeast Asia, encompassing Lao
   People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and
   Myanmar, as well as their respective river basins. Utilizing Climate
   Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS) having a
   spatial resolution of 5 km spanning from 1981 to 2021, rainfall
   variability and trends were examined. Data preprocessing and geospatial
   analysis were conducted using R-Studio and ArcGIS software. The
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator were employed for
   annual and seasonal rainfall trend analysis. Myanmar exhibited the
   highest average annual rainfall of 2137 mm during the study period,
   while Thailand had the lowest (1641 mm). Over the past four decades, the
   Peninsula Malaysian Basin experienced the highest average annual
   rainfall (2691 mm), whereas the Chao Praya Basin recorded the lowest
   (1311 mm). Increasing trends in rainfall were observed across all five
   countries and nine major river basins. Vietnam displayed the highest
   annual rainfall trend of 5.63 mm/year, while Lao PDR exhibited the
   lowest trend (3.16 mm/year). Among the river basins, the Chao Phraya
   Basin demonstrated the maximum annual rainfall trend (11.21 mm/year),
   while the Peninsula Malaysia Basin had the minimum trend (1.21 mm/year).
   These findings could significantly contribute to climate change
   monitoring in the region and can aid policymakers in sectors such as
   agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management.},

   River Basin, India},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Understanding rainfall is vital for analyzing river basins as it is an
   integral part of its hydrological cycle. This paper has focused on
   examining annual and seasonal precipitation variation from the year 1901
   to 2021 along with maximum and minimum temperatures from the year 1951
   to 2021 within the Damodar River Basin. Serial dependence is determined
   initially by calculating lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient on the time
   series dataset before removing impacts of serial correlation by applying
   pre-whiteness processing ahead of conducting Mann-Kendall tests. The
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test alongside Sen's slope estimator have
   helped ascertain extreme precipitation and temperature presence and size
   magnitudes while Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) tests have aided us in
   detecting sudden change within these trends. The average annual maximum
   and minimum temperatures have exhibited declining and increasing trends,
   according to a careful review of the data, the maximum and minimum
   temperature during the monsoon have shown an increasing tendency. The
   annual and monsoon rainfall are both trending downward by - 0.582
   mm/year and - 0.355 mm/year, respectively. While the annual minimum
   temperature showed an increasing trend (0.0028 degrees C), the annual
   maximum temperature for the observed time showed a low warming or
   falling trend of (- 0.0019 degrees C). At a 5\% level of significance,
   the annual minimum temperature result was found to be statistically
   significant, but the annual maximum temperature trend result was not.
   The SQMK approach demonstrates periodic trend fluctuation, which is
   particularly apparent during the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. This
   investigation makes use of a thorough examination of the shifting trends
   in rainfall patterns seen in hydro-meteorological data collected within
   the Damodar River Basin. The results of this study have a great deal of
   promise for use in managing water resources and promoting sustainable
   agriculture in the basin's environs.},

Abstract = {The core purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial variation
   in monthly, seasonally and yearly rainfall patterns in the Kolkata
   district of West Bengal, India, between 1901 and 2019 (Around 119
   years). The trend's reliability and intensity were assessed
   non-parametrically applying monthly rainfall data series and the Mann
   Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope estimators.The data showed a considerable
   increase in pre-monsoon, monsoon, postmonsoonand also annual rainfall
   while decreasing in winter rainfall across the district of Kolkata. The
   positive trend is identified in the data series of pre-monsoon, monsoon,
   post-monsoon and annual rainfall, however, winter rainfall exhibited
   negative trends. The highest increase in rainfall was observed during
   the post-monsoon season (0.365091 mm year-1), with the smallest increase
   (0.232591 mm year-1) occurring during the pre-monsoon season.In the
   winter season, there was a notable rain that has declined (-0.01356 mm
   year-1). The Coefficient of Variation (CV), \%, was used to determine
   the pattern of rainfall variability. The winter rainfall exhibited the
   highest CV rating (72.89\%), but annual rainfall showed a minimum CV
   value (17.68\%). Generally speaking, a high variance in CV was
   discovered, indicating that the whole area is very sensitive to droughts
   and floods. For future forecasts, there is a considerable difference in
   monthly rainfall data between linear regression and Sequential Minimal
   Optimization (SMOreg), while the annual rainfall is little difference
   between linear regression, SMOreg and Cellular Automata-Artificial
   Neural Network (CA-ANN) analysis.},

   systems during boreal and austral summer seasons},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {229},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this study, we have analyzed the variabilities in the global monsoon
   rainfall using Climate Research Unit monthly data for the period 1901 to
   2020. The global monsoon domains are selected based on the difference in
   rainfall between the summer and winter as mentioned in the study of Wang
   and Ding (2006). The regions with high rainfall in the northern
   hemisphere (southern hemisphere) during the boreal (austral) summer are
   four (three), which is consistent with the results of Geen et al., 2020
   and Wang and Ding 2008. In the regions of the northern hemisphere, a
   maximum value of mean rainfall is found in North America (NAM, 206.3 mm
   month-1), followed by South Asia (SAS, 204.3 mm month-1), and the least
   rainfall is observed in Southern Africa (SAF, 8.1 mm month-1); however,
   during the austral summer (DJFM), the maximum rainfall is observed in
   Australia (AUS, 222.7 mm month-1) followed by South America (SAM, 209.9
   mm month-1). The interannual rainfall pattern shows a significant
   increasing trend for East Asia (EAS, 2 mm month-1 century-1), and a
   significant decreasing trend for West Africa (WAF) and SAS (-4 mm
   month-1 century- 1) during boreal summer. During the austral summer,
   significant increasing (decreasing) trends were observed for AUS, SAM
   and NAM (WAF and SAS) with values of 14,6 and 1 (-2 and - 0) mm month-1
   century-1, respectively. The summer-winter rainfall relationships are
   significant for all the regions except for the SAS and SAM. This
   correlation follows an out of phase pattern for the EAS domain. During
   boreal (austral) summer, rainfall in the northern (southern) hemisphere
   domains is mostly in-phase (out-of-phase). The wavelet analysis shows
   that WAF, SAS, SAF, and SAM domains have significant multidecadal
   variability, and EAS and NAM show intradecadal variability during boreal
   summer. The WAF and NAM show the intradecadal variability and all the
   other regions show multidecadal variability during the boreal winter.},

Abstract = {Compound flooding from rainfall and storm tides is prone to occur in
   coastal cities. The identification of them is essential for controlling
   urban flooding. First, the dependence between rainfall and storm tides
   is quantified by Kendall's t, Spearman's ?, and tail dependence
   coefficient. Then, a bivariate copula-based probability distribution
   model is built to calculate the joint probability and conditional
   probability of rainfall and storm tides. Finally, MK and SQMK methods
   are employed to detect the trends of the dependence and joint
   probability. The results are as follows: (1) The dependence between
   strong rainfall and corresponding storm tides is much higher than that
   of small rainfall and storm tides, and the effect of tropical cyclones
   may be one of the reasons. (2) The dependence between rainfall and storm
   tides is the largest in October and the smallest in July. It should pay
   more attention to the compound flooding caused by rainfall and storm
   tides in October for Haikou. (3) The upper tail dependence coefficient
   of the rainfall and storm tides is significantly greater than the lower
   tail dependence coefficient and exhibits a significant positive trend.
   The results can provide additional insights into the effect of rainfall
   and storm tides on coastal flood management.},

Abstract = {The variability, intensity, and distribution of rainfall have drawn a
   lot of interest globally and especially in nations where rainfed
   agriculture is the norm. This article uses rainfall data from the Rwanda
   Meteorology Agency for the years 1981 to 2021 to delineate and analyze
   rainfall variability and trends in the Kayonza District. The time series
   were grouped using the K-means clustering technique based on computed
   Euclidean distance, the total within-cluster sum of squares, and the
   elbow plot technique to determine the optimal number of clusters. The
   coefficient of variation measures was employed to analyze rainfall
   variability, while Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test were used,
   respectively, to find trends and changes in magnitude. The results
   indicated four near homogeneous zones named region one to four. The dry
   seasons indicated higher variability compared to rainy seasons and
   annual rainfall total with a variability of 128-142\% over the
   southeastern part during June to August (JJA) season, while a
   variability of 16-48\% was observed over most of the district during
   both annual and rainy seasons. It was further noted that the areas in
   the central part of the Kayonza District indicated a significant
   increasing trend at a significance level of 95\% and above during
   January to February (JF), September to December (SOND), and on annual
   basis, while March to May (MAM) and JJA season exhibited no significant
   trend. The findings of this study are essential for creating adequate
   mitigation strategies to lessen climate change's effects on agriculture
   as well as other socioeconomic sectors.},

Abstract = {Adequate and consistent rainfall is essential for sustaining water
   resources, agricultural production, and overall economy of a nation. To
   explore the variability and changes in rainfall system, the most common
   and widely employed conventional trend methods are linear regression
   (LR) and Mann-Kendall (MK) trend tests. These methods are often subject
   to inconsistent results with respect to the extent of changes reported
   in rainfall patterns. This study utilizes the advanced LR i.e., quantile
   regression (QR) and the modified MK (m-MK) trend methods to investigate
   the retrospective rainfall characteristics and associated trends for
   multi-temporal periods i.e., long-term (1951-2020), bifurcated (pre-1985
   and post-1985), and most-recent (2000-2020), over different climate
   zones of India. Furthermore, temporal evolution and trend consistency
   (stability) were examined by comparing multi-temporal slope coefficients
   at various quantiles (t) of rainfall distribution. The long-term trends
   in general rainfall characteristics (GRCs) exhibited drying patterns,
   while opposite increasing trends were observed in extreme rainfall
   characteristics (ERCs) for most of the study region. The results of QR
   at median tail (t = 0.5) were more or less consistent with the results
   of m-MK test. Interestingly, an increase in the trend significance and
   magnitude was observed at higher quantiles (t > 0.8). The bifurcated and
   long-term periods showed contrasting results in rainfall
   characteristics, suggesting trend instability whereas during pre-1985,
   post-1985, and most-recent periods, the temporal evolution of GRCs
   revealed a systematic increment in positive trend significance.
   Altogether, the advanced and modified trend assessment in the present
   research compliments conventional trend methods with improved trend
   detection and trend consistency identification.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a worldwide problem caused by various anthropogenic
   activities, leading to changes in hydroclimatic variables like
   temperature, rainfall, riverine flow, and extreme hydrometeorological
   events. In India, a significant change is noted in its natural resources
   and agriculture sectors. In this study, we analysed the long-term
   spatio-temporal change in rainfall patterns of Madhya Pradesh, Central
   India, using Indian Meteorological Department high-resolution gridded
   data from 439 grid points. The coefficient of variance analysis showed
   low variability in annual and monsoon rainfall but significant
   variability in pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons, indicating
   considerable seasonal variation. Pre-monsoon rainfall exhibited an
   increasing trend (0.018 mm annually), while annual, monsoon,
   post-monsoon, and winter rainfall showed decreasing trends. Change point
   analysis identified shifts in rainfall patterns in 1998 (monsoon,
   annual), 1955 ( pre-monsoon), 1987 (post-monsoon), and 1986 (winter).
   Spatio-temporal distribution maps depicted irregular rainfall, with some
   areas experiencing drastic declines in precipitation after 1998. The
   maximum average annual rainfall reduced from 1,769 to 1,401 mm after
   1998 affecting water availability. The study's findings highlight a
   significant shift in Madhya Pradesh's seasonal rainfall distribution
   after 1998, urging researchers and policymakers to address
   water-intensive cropping practices and foster climate resilience for a
   sustainable future in the region.},

Abstract = {Information about temperature and rainfall, the main elements of the
   Earth's climate, is essential in determining the characteristics of
   world climate variations. The changes in these two parameters, which
   show significant variability in both spatial and temporal scales, reveal
   essential clues for understanding the general structure of the climate.
   This study aims to investigate the effect of climate change on the
   annual maximum (extreme) rainfall values observed in Turkey. In this
   context, trend analyses were performed using Mann-Kendall (MK) test,
   innovative trend analysis (ITA), and improved visualization of ITA
   (IV-ITA) methods to the standard durations (t = 5, 10, 15, 30 min, and
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24 h) of the annual maximum rainfalls of 82
   stations located in seven geographical regions of Turkey between 1975
   and 2015. Trends for low and high maximum rainfall values were
   determined with IV-ITA. According to the MK test, there was an
   increasing trend of 15\% in all stations, while only a decreasing trend
   of 1\% was detected. Besides, the ITA method determined these values as
   63\% and 17\%, respectively. The trends for low and high category values
   in the IV-ITA method are consistent, with approximately 60\% increasing
   and 20\% decreasing trends. An increasing trend is dominant throughout
   Turkey, and this trend is concentrated in the Black Sea, Marmara, and
   Aegean regions. Medium- and long-duration rainfall tended to increase,
   while short-duration rainfall tended to decrease.},

Abstract = {Tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall is an important component of global
   precipitation. Based on a 22-year satellite-based record of observed
   precipitation from 1998 to 2019, we find that composite rainfall rates
   averaged within 500 km of TCs have increased. However, the background
   precipitation rate in the TC-affected regions has also increased.
   Therefore we find, by subtracting the background increase in
   precipitation rate from the TC precipitation composite, that TC
   precipitation rates--relative to the background--have decreased, and
   that TC-related extreme precipitation rates near the TC center have also
   decreased. Besides TC intensity and environmental sea surface
   temperature, the TC-induced sea surface cooling, typically formed like a
   cold wake feature, is indicated to be a potentially important
   contributor to TC rainfall changes. The cold wake diminishes the upward
   transport of surface enthalpy flux and leads to a decrease of moisture
   in the boundary layer, being unfavorable for the rainfall. The relative
   decreasing rainfall trend of TCs to the background is therefore
   attributed to the strengthening sea surface cooling induced by TCs. The
   TC-ocean interaction is suggested to be fully resolved in
   state-of-the-art global and regional climate models in order to improve
   TC rainfall simulations and projections.},

Title = {Reversal of decadal trend in West China autumn rainfall in the late
   1990s and possible causes},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {294},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As a complex regional weather and climate phenomenon in China, the
   highly variable West China autumn rainfall (WCAR) causes severe flooding
   and related disasters that can have major impacts on socioeconomic and
   environmental sustainability. This study investigated both the reversal
   of the decadal trend in the WCAR during 1961-2020 and the related
   atmospheric circulation and oceanic backgrounds. The results showed that
   the decadal trend in the WCAR underwent distinct reversal in the late
   1990s, with a significant trend of decline (increase) before (after)
   this reversal, which was directly linked to variations in the
   large-scale Eurasian atmospheric circulation, local moisture transport
   and dynamic conditions, and sea surface temperature (SST) in the
   subtropical South Pacific. Further investigation indicated that reduced
   sea level pressure over Asia, an enhanced European blocking high, and a
   deepened Lake Balkhash trough during the latter period favored southward
   movement of high-latitude cold air into West China. Moreover, a stronger
   southerly flow in the southern West China was observed in the latter
   period, which tended to transport more moisture from low-latitude ocean
   areas. Northward displacement of the East Asian jet (EAJ) also played a
   strong dynamic role in the reversal of the WCAR trend. Additionally, the
   reversal of the decadal trend in WCAR might also be attributed to a
   change in the trend of SST in the subtropical South Pacific from warming
   to cooling in the late 1990s. This resulted in southward displacement of
   the EAJ, which generated an anomalous descent and reduction in the WCAR.},

Title = {Influence of short- and long-term persistence on identification of

Abstract = {Investigating the temporal dynamics of rainfall in a changing climate,
   especially in rainfed agriculture regions, is crucial for analyzing
   climate-induced changes and offering adaptation options. Since Mizoram
   experiences unfavorable impacts of rain nearly every year, the region
   rainfall has been altering over the years, and vital climatic activity
   is becoming uncontrollable. The current study is primarily concerned
   with the changing trend of rainfall over Mizoram, which includes both
   short-term persistence (STP) and long-term persistence (LTP) of rainfall
   in seasonal and annual time series of rainfall overseeing for the period
   of 25 years of daily average rainfall from 1996 to 2020 collected
   collectively from the seven stations over the study area of Mizoram.
   Four different Mann-Kendall method iterations were used to analyze
   rainfall trends: the original or conventional method (without
   autocorrelation) (MnKn1), removing lag-1 autocorrelation (trend-free
   pre-whitening), considering multiple lag autocorrelation (more than
   lag-1 autocorrelation) (MnKn3), and Hurst coefficient or LTP (MnKn4). In
   the analysis, the study found that during monsoon, station Lawngtlai
   (LT) observed the highest rainfall having a Z value of 1.986, increased
   by 0.466 cm/year, while station Serchhip (SC) observed the lowest
   rainfall having Z value of -2.282, decreased by -0.163 cm/year. After
   applying modified MnKn4, we observed LTP of rainfall in winter at
   station Lawngtlai (LT) with an increasing trend and other stations
   observing STP in almost all seasons either increasing or decreasing
   trend. Therefore, possible climate change adaptation measures should be
   made to optimize rainfall use for various applications for the states of
   Mizoram.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal rainfall trend analysis as an indicator of climatic
   change provides critical information for improved water resource
   planning. However, the spatiotemporal changing behavior of rainfall is
   much less understood in a tropical monsoon-dominated country like
   Bangladesh. To this end, this research aims to analyze spatiotemporal
   variations in rainfall for the period 1980-2020 over Bangladesh at
   seasonal and monthly scales using MAKESENS, the Pettitt test, and
   innovative trend analysis. Multilayer Perception (MLP) neural network
   was used to predict the next 8 years' rainfall changes nationally in
   Bangladesh. To investigate the spatial pattern of rainfall trends, the
   inverse distance weighting model was adopted within the ArcGIS
   environment. Results show that mean annual rainfall is 2432.6 mm, of
   which 57.6\% was recorded from July to August. The Mann-Kendall trend
   test reveals that 77\% of stations are declining, and 23\% have a rising
   trend in the monthly rainfall. More than 80\% of stations face a
   declining trend from November to March and August. There is a declining
   trend for seasonal rainfall at 82\% of stations during the pre-monsoon,
   75\% during the monsoon, and 100\% during the post-monsoon. A
   significant decline trend was identified in the north-center during the
   pre-monsoon, the northern part during the monsoon, and the southern and
   northwestern portions during the post-monsoon season. Predicted rainfall
   by MLP till 2030 suggests that there will be little rain from November
   to February, and the maximum fluctuating rainfall will occur in 2025 and
   2027-2029. The ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data findings suggested that
   changing rainfall patterns in Bangladesh may have been driven by rising
   or reducing convective precipitation rates, low cloud cover, and
   inadequate vertically integrated moisture divergence. Given the shortage
   of water resources and the anticipated rise in water demand, the study's
   findings have some implications for managing water resources in
   Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Location-specific information on annual and seasonal rainfall trends has
   immense utility in devising crop planning as well as water resource
   management in West Bengal. We assessed long-period (1901-2020) trends
   and magnitudes of seasonal and annual rainfall across districts of West
   Bengal. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test, sequential
   Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test, and Sen's slope estimator were applied to the
   gridded (0.25 \& DEG; x 0.25 \& DEG;) rainfall dataset. Results revealed
   that both the annual and seasonal rainfall of West Bengal increased
   non-significantly (p>0.05), except for the winter season, which
   experienced a non-significant decrease. Annual rainfall across a
   majority of the districts in sub-Himalayan West Bengal (SHWB) declined
   non-significantly. On the contrary, a significant (p<0.05) increase in
   annual rainfall was observed across most of the districts of Gangetic
   West Bengal (GWB) at the rate of 1.8 mm year(-1) to 2.9 mm year(-1).
   Monsoon rainfall increased significantly over Gangetic West Bengal (GWB)
   at 1.4 mm year(-1) to 2.1 mm year(-1), while it declined significantly
   in Dakshin Dinajpur district at 3.2 mm year(-1) of SHWB. Post-monsoon
   rainfall increased significantly over GWB at the rate of 0.5 mm year(-1)
   to 0.9 mm year(-1). The winter rainfall decreased non-significantly
   across all the districts. Normalized rainfall anomaly (NRA) revealed
   that 17\% of the study period experienced surplus (NRA>1) rainfall,
   while another 17\% received deficit (NRA>-1) rainfall. Nearly 70\% year
   received normal monsoon rainfall (NRA = \& PLUSMN;1) and 16\% year
   deficit and 14\% year surplus rainfall. The SQMK test for seasonal
   rainfall showed a general trend change point around 1960 and 1970 in
   both the district and state-level annual rainfall.},

Abstract = {The present study is focused on the rainfall trend analysis of Punjab
   state in India. In this regard, thirty-three rain gauge stations were
   considered. The rainfall trend was predicted using the innovative trend
   analysis and compared with the Mann-Kendall test and Sen Slope
   estimator. The analysis reveals that most of the semi-urban areas of the
   Punjab state are experiencing a declining trend of rainfall, whereas
   urban and rural areas are experiencing an increasing annual rainfall
   trend at 5\% level of significance in the last two decades of the
   twentieth century. The effect of declining trend of rainfall on
   frequency of occurrence drought was analysed using standardised
   precipitation index (SPI) and observed that the frequency of occurrence
   of drought is more in last two decades in the semi-urban areas of Punjab
   state. The effect of negative rainfall trend and drought condition is
   causing a significant rise in rain water deficit for agriculture and is
   expected to lie in a range of 30-48\% of current water demand in next 15
   years for Patiala district. The deficit rainwater will cause more
   extraction of groundwater for agriculture and the stress on groundwater
   may lead to food security issue. The stress on groundwater can be
   relieved by identifying the potential rainwater harvesting zone and it
   is observed that around 60\% area of the Patiala district have good
   potential for rainwater harvesting. The spatio-temporal variation of
   rainfall trend, and drought analysis of the present study is expected to
   help in better planning and efficient management of agricultural
   practices.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2023},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Climate change can have an influence on rainfall that significantly
   affects the magnitude frequency of floods and droughts. Therefore, the
   analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution, variability, and trends of
   rainfall over the Mahi Basin in India is an important objective of the
   present work. Accordingly, a serial autocorrelation, coefficient of
   variation, Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope test, innovative trend
   analysis (ITA), and Pettitt's test were used in the rainfall analysis.
   The outcomes were derived from the monthly precipitation data
   (1901-2012) of 14 meteorology stations in the Mahi Basin. The serial
   autocorrelation results showed that there is no autocorrelation in the
   data series. The rainfall statistics denoted that the Mahi Basin
   receives 94.8\% of its rainfall (821 mm) in the monsoon period
   (June-September). The normalized accumulated departure from the mean
   reveals that the annual and monsoon rainfall of the Mahi Basin were
   below average from 1901 to 1930 and above average from 1930 to 1990,
   followed by a period of fluctuating conditions. Annual and monsoon
   rainfall variations increase in the lower catchment of the basin. The
   annual and monsoon rainfall trend analysis specified a significant
   declining tendency for four stations and an increasing tendency for 3
   stations, respectively. A significant declining trend in winter rainfall
   was observed for 9 stations under review. Likewise, out of 14 stations,
   9 stations denote a significant decrease in pre-monsoon rainfall.
   Nevertheless, there is no significant increasing or decreasing tendency
   in annual, monsoon, and post-monsoon rainfall in the Mahi Basin. The
   Mann-Kendall test and innovative trend analysis indicate identical
   tendencies of annual and seasonal rainfall on the basin scale. The
   annual and monsoon rainfall of the basin showed a positive shift in
   rainfall after 1926. The rainfall analysis confirms that despite
   spatiotemporal variations in rainfall, there are no significant positive
   or negative trends of annual and monsoon rainfall on the basin scale. It
   suggests that the Mahi Basin received average rainfall (867 mm) annually
   and in the monsoon season (821 mm) from 1901 to 2012, except for a few
   years of high and low rainfall. Therefore, this study is important for
   flood and drought management, agriculture, and water management in the
   Mahi Basin.},

Abstract = {Rainfall and near-surface wind speed are two crucial parameters
   affecting climate change-induced extreme events. It is essential to
   perform a trend analysis of these parameters to assess the
   spatiotemporal variation of these events. Thus, the current study aimed
   to investigate seasonal rainfall and near-surface wind speed variability
   over six eastern coastal agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of India (AEZs 3,
   7, 8, 11, 12, and 18) over 101 years (1920-2020). Further, the
   Mann-Kendall (MK), modified Mann-Kendall (MMK), bootstrapped
   Mann-Kendall (BMK), innovative trend analysis (ITA), and detrended
   fluctuation analysis (DFA) tests were employed in this study to analyse
   the trends of rainfall and near-surface wind speed. An increasing trend
   was noticed in the annual rainfall in the southern AEZs and the zones
   adjacent to the coastline. In the pre-monsoon season, the AEZs 12 and 18
   showed an increasing rainfall trend, whereas the remaining AEZs
   demonstrated a decreasing trend. Except for AEZ 7, all zones experienced
   a negative rainfall trend in the post-monsoon season. The results
   revealed that all AEZs had negative near-surface wind speed trends,
   which could be attributed to climate change. ITA outperformed the rest
   of the trend analysis techniques in detecting hidden trends. The DFA
   test revealed that the trend pattern would continue in the future for
   56\% of the datasets. This study will assist researchers and
   policymakers in developing a sustainable water resources management plan
   by considering the trend patterns of meteorological variables across the
   agro-ecological regions.},

Title = {Multidecadal summer monsoon rainfall trend reversals in South Peninsular
   India: A new approach to examining long-term rainfall dataset},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {624},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A long-term (1901-2020) gridded summer monsoon rainfall dataset for
   South Indian Peninsula has been examined to identify prominent rainfall
   trend reversals during the last 120 years. The current understanding of
   long-term rainfall variability in India is largely based on the linear
   monotonic trend analysis over a large geographical area in which
   multidecadal signatures and their geographical variations are missed
   out. Therefore, multidecadal rainfall trend variations are not clearly
   recognized. To overcome this limitation, an innovative, multipronged,
   and robust methodology based on mathematical and statistical tools is
   developed involving: 31years moving average of percentage departure of
   summer monsoon rainfall for 120 years at district level; 15years sliding
   trend analysis to identify the year of inflection point based on a
   change in direction of the trend; K-Means cluster analysis; Z-score
   based normality test of clusters; and determination of prominent
   timeframe of reversal of multidecadal rainfall trend. Using this
   methodology, long-term summer monsoon rainfall data (1901-2020) at a
   district level in South Peninsular India has been analysed. Three major
   timeframes of rainfall trend reversals have been identified during the
   last 120 years. These are: (1) from decreasing to increasing rainfall
   trend around 1934, affecting 67\% of the area; (ii) from increasing to
   decreasing rainfall trend around 1969, affecting 45\% of the area; and
   (iii) from decreasing to increasing rainfall trend around 1986,
   affecting 45\% of the area. The significance of this study is that it
   identifies systematic reversals in rainfall trends in long-term data.
   The implication of this study is that it highlights the need to identify
   the corresponding meteorological, climatic, or anthropogenic causal
   factors behind the observed rainfall trend reversals.},

Title = {Metagenomics reveals the abundance and accumulation trend of antibiotic
   resistance gene profile under long-term no tillage in a rainfed
   agroecosystem},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Widespread soil resistance can seriously endanger sustainable food
   production and soil health. Conservation tillage is a promising practice
   for improving soil structure and health. However, the impact of
   long-term no-tillage on the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in
   agricultural soils remains unexplored. Based on the long-term (>11 yr)
   tillage experimental fields that include both conservation tillage
   practices {[}no tillage (ZT)] and conventional tillage practices
   {[}plough tillage (PT)], we investigated the accumulation trend of
   antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in farmland soils under long-term
   no-tillage conditions. We aimed to provide a scientific basis for
   formulating agricultural production strategies to promote ecological
   environment safety and human health. In comparison to PT, ZT led to a
   considerable reduction in the relative abundance of both antibiotic
   resistance genes and antibiotic target gene families in the soil.
   Furthermore, the abundance of all ARGs were considerably lower in the ZT
   soil. The classification of drug resistance showed that ZT substantially
   decreased the relative abundance of Ethambutol (59.97\%), \&
   beta;-lactams (44.87\%), Fosfomycin (35.82\%), Sulfonamides (34.64\%),
   Polymyxins (33.67\%), MLSB (32.78\%), Chloramphenicol (28.57\%),
   Multi-drug resistance (26.22\%), Efflux pump (23.46\%), Aminoglycosides
   (16.79\%), Trimethoprim (13.21\%), Isoniazid (11.34\%), Fluoroquinolone
   (6.21\%) resistance genes, compared to PT soil. In addition, the
   abundance of the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
   Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes decreased considerably. The Mantel
   test indicated that long-term ZT practices substantially increased the
   abundance of beneficial microbial flora and inhibited the enrichment of
   ARGs in soil by improving soil microbial diversity, metabolic activity,
   increasing SOC, TN, and available Zn, and decreasing pH. Overall,
   long-term no-tillage practices inhibit the accumulation of antibiotic
   resistance genes in farmland soil, which is a promising agricultural
   management measure to reduce the accumulation risk of soil ARGs.},

Abstract = {Tropical cyclones (TCs) and the associated rainfall (TCR) have received
   increasing attention because of their catastrophic damages. Due to the
   differences in TC characteristics and TCR in different ocean basins, the
   changes in TCR would be complicated for areas receiving TC landfalling
   from multi-basins. Therefore, separating TCR and TC characteristics from
   the formation basins can offer more insights for accurately evaluating
   TCR in the landfalling areas. Here we selected the TC-prone Mainland
   Southeast Asia (MSEA) to investigate changes in TCR regarding TC
   characteristics from the surrounding formation basins from 1983 to 2020.
   Results show that the interannual variability of the total TCs
   influencing MSEA (MSEA-ALL-TC) characteristics, including number, total
   duration, maximum intensity and accumulated cyclone energy, was
   dominated by the TCs originating from the Western North Pacific
   (WNP-TC). However, the total TCR was controlled by the TCs originating
   from the WNP and the South China Sea (SCS-TC), whose influence on TCR
   was concentrated in the eastern MSEA. TCR associated with TCs
   originating from the Bay of Bengal was relatively small and concentrated
   in the western MSEA. For the whole MSEA, the total TCR contributed up to
   47\% of the annual extreme rainfall amount. Annual TCR presented
   significant decreasing trends in the southeast MSEA, while increasing
   trends exist in the northeast. These contrasting trends are attributed
   to the reduced tendency of WNP-TC track density and the increased SCS-TC
   rainfall rate. We also found that the SCS-TC induced a higher rainfall
   rate than the other two basins. The TC characteristics of number, total
   duration, maximum intensity and accumulated cyclone energy were
   significantly correlated with TCR in each formation basin, with the
   highest correlation of the total duration. This study improves our
   understanding of the influence of changes in TC characteristics on TCR
   in the TC multi-source region.},

Abstract = {The unpredictability of the climate has drawn a lot of interest
   worldwide, especially that of the annual mean temperatures and rainfall.
   In this study, non-parametric tests such as the LOWESS curve method,
   Mann-Kendall (MK), SNHT test, Pettitt's test (PT), and Buishand range
   test (BRT) were used to evaluate long-term (2000-2020) rainfall data
   series to examine rainfall variability. The Dakshina Kannada district
   has the highest average rainfall is 3495.6 mm with a magnitude change\%
   of about 26.2, while the Koppala district has the lowest average
   rainfall roughly about 530.4 mm, with a magnitude change \% of about
   11.49 mm in a year. The statistics from the fitted prediction line were
   utilized to determine the maximum coefficient determination (R-2 =
   0.8808) in the Uttara Kannada region. Because of the commencement of the
   present rising era, 2015 is the shift year in rainfall with the highest
   potential of being a change point in the state's Western Ghats region.
   It was also revealed that the majority of the districts exhibit positive
   trends before the change point and vice versa. The current research can
   be used to plan for and minimize the agricultural and water resource
   challenges in the state of Karnataka. To link observable patterns to
   climate variability, the next inquiry must identify the source of these
   changes. Overall, the study's findings will help organize and improve
   drought, flood, and water resource management techniques in the state.},

Title = {Manifestation of spatially varying demarcations in Indian rainfall
   trends through change-point analysis (1901-2020)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The rainfall over the Indian region, governed majorly by the monsoonal
   flow, is a point of research in the perspective of climate change. In
   this paper, we compute the change points in the rainfall series at every
   grid of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) daily gridded rainfall
   data for a period of 120 years (1901 to 2020). The map shows clearly
   demarcated regions indicating different zones, where the rainfall
   statistics have altered at different periods. It is observed that in a
   major part of central India, the shift in rainfall intensity is mainly
   associated with the time frame 1955-1965; in the Indo-Gangetic plain,
   the changes are found to be more recent (1990), while the latest changes
   (post 2000) are observed particularly for North Eastern region and some
   parts along the East Indian coast. The changeover years are significant
   at a 95\% confidence level for most part of the Indian landmass. The
   causes may be surmised due to moisture transport from the Arabian Sea
   (Central India), the presence of aerosol (Gangetic Plain), and the
   possible revival of monsoon due to land-ocean gradient (Eastern coast
   and North East India). This is the first-ever study which provides a
   comprehensive daily rainfall change point map over India using 120 years
   of gridded station data.},

Abstract = {The Thar Desert receives very scarce and scanty rainfall; hence, water
   is given the top priority and importance in daily life. During the past
   decades, there has been a variation in the trend of the rainfall,
   climate, and other atmospheric conditions in the Jaisalmer district. An
   analytical study has been carried out to investigate this changing
   environmental phenomenon. Sixteen grids have been selected to study the
   trend and magnitude of the slope for rainfall using the MMK (Modified
   Mann-Kendall) test and Sen's Slope estimator. Pettitt's test, SNHT
   (Standard Normal Homogeneity Test), and Buishand's test have been used
   to find trend change year in 121-year time series of rainfall. Mean
   annual rainfall for all grids shows positive values of Kendall's tau and
   Sen's Slope, which indicate that trend interpretation is rising, and
   test interpretation is increasing. Most of the results obtained from
   grids show the year `1992' as the trend-changing year. A significant
   rise in mean annual rainfall has been noticed after the change of year
   in the study area. This type of study has not been conducted earlier in
   the region to identify the rainfall trend and change of year of trend.
   This study will help policymakers to take necessary action.},

Title = {Ecological trends in moth communities (Geometridae, Lepidoptera) along a
   complete rainforest elevation gradient in Papua New Guinea},
Journal = {INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {1. The tropical rainforest elevation gradients, extending from lowlands
   to treeline, often represent global maxima of biodiversity and are
   models for community studies.
   2. We surveyed geometrid moths along a complete rainforest gradient from
   200 to 3700 m asl. in Papua New Guinea. The 16,424 moths collected with
   light traps represented 1102 species, a high diversity for such system.
   We demonstrated the importance of molecular data for taxonomy as COI
   sequences (DNA barcodes) changed the definition of 19\% of morphological
   species.
   3. The abundance of geometrids did not change with elevation while their
   species richness peaked at 1200 m asl. The mid-elevation diversity peak
   is a common, but poorly understood, pattern for geometrids. It was best
   explained by the species richness of the vegetation. At the same time,
   the community was exposed to opposing trends in abiotic favourability
   (decreasing temperature) and biotic favourability (decreasing predation
   by ants, birds and bats) with elevation, potentially contributing to
   such unimodal trends in species richness.
   4. Beta diversity of communities separated by 500 m elevation increased
   with increasing elevation, reflecting decreasing mean elevational range
   of species-a pattern opposite to that expected under the Rapoport's
   rule. 5. The total number of species along the elevation gradient
   corresponded to 280\% of the highest local community diversity. This
   enrichment of species underscores the key role of long elevational
   gradients in maintaining high regional diversity and makes them a
   conservation priority, especially as they also allow for redistribution
   of species in response to climate change.},

Abstract = {Rainfall variability is a key element in water resource management.
   There has been significant variability in rainfall in Arunachal Pradesh,
   with the state being in the highest rainfall zone in India. The present
   study attempts to investigate the annual rainfall trend along with the
   change points in the rainfall time series, considering more than a
   hundred years of data (1901-2002) in eleven districts of Arunachal
   Pradesh. First, a serial correlation test was conducted on the entire
   time-series data for the three districts to detect the serially
   independent time series, followed by the non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test and Spearman's rank correlation test to ascertain the presence of a
   statistically significant trend in hydrological climate variables. Sen's
   slope method was applied to estimate the magnitude of the trend.
   Pre-whitening, trend free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall, and bias corrected
   pre-whitening, along with two variance correction approaches, are
   applied to the serially correlated data. All the districts under
   consideration show a decreasing trend in rainfall in the investigation
   over the years. A comparative study of the trend test method was also
   carried out. Further, to identify the trend change points in the time
   series, a sequential Mann-Kendall test is conducted. Assessing 100 years
   of time series data for the region makes the study unique of its kind
   and is likely to play a vital role in environmental policymaking.
   Furthermore, it will be helpful for water resource management, land use,
   land cover management, sustainable agricultural planning, and the
   overall socio-economic development of the region.},

   tests revealed that the quality of harvested rainwater is affected by
   proximity to a waste disposal or incineration facility, animal presence,
   cistern treatment, and cistern age (P < 0.05), while soil samples were
   associated with community (P < 0.05). Coliform and E. coli

Abstract = {Streamflow alteration is one of the most noticeable effects of changes
   in rainfall patterns (both intensity and amount) in the Himalayan
   region. Additionally, the impact of climate change on the localized
   rainfall patterns is particularly significant, which is more crucial in
   the Himalayas. This study carries out a comprehensive analysis on
   temporal variability of the rainfall and its relation to streamflow in a
   typical mountain river basin, located in the southern aspect of central
   Himalayas. The primary objective of this study is to analyze seasonal
   and annual rainfall trends across rain gauge stations within the
   selected Kali Gandaki (KG) River Basin. Monthly rainfall data were used
   to examine the rainfall and streamflow trends. Mann-Kendall (MK) trend
   test, Sen's slope, and sequential MK (SQMK) analysis were employed to
   evaluate monotonic trends on homogenized time series data. Our findings
   revealed the formation of an anticlockwise hysteresis loop between
   streamflow and rainfall within the catchment. Understanding the
   relationship between streamflow and rainfall would provide a foundation
   for effective water resources management.},

Abstract = {In the present study, long-term rainfall trend was analyzed using the
   traditional Mann-Kendall (MK) test and innovative trend analysis (ITA)
   method for annual and seasonal rainfall series for 20 districts of
   Punjab state for the period of 1951-2021. The autocorrelation test was
   performed to detect the presence or absence of serial correlation in the
   rainfall series. Based on the autocorrelation test, MK or modified
   Mann-Kendall (MMK) test and Sen's slope test were applied to determine
   the direction and magnitude of the rainfall trend, respectively. The ITA
   which revealed the presence of a trend graphically was compared with the
   traditional MK/MMK test. The autocorrelation test showed that all the
   annual rainfall series are serially independent, except for the
   Hoshiarpur. The MK/MMK test revealed the presence of a decreasing trend
   in annual rainfall series of all districts, except for Fatehgarh Sahib,
   Kapurthala, Patiala, and Tarn Taran of the central zone and Muktsar of
   the south west zone. The computed probable change point year was 1998.
   The innovative trend slope revealed the presence of a significant
   decreasing trend for the districts of Punjab missed by the traditional
   MK/MMK test. The highest decrease (- 4.5 mm/year) in annual rainfall was
   observed at Gurdaspur of the north zone and Faridkot of the south west
   zone. The ITA showed the statistically significant decreasing trend in
   annual rainfall for all the districts of the south west zone at 1\%
   significance level. The analysis using ITA determined the presence of
   hidden trends missed by the traditional MK/MMK test. The decreasing
   pattern in rainfall over most of the districts and high irrigation
   requirement for largely growing paddy crop of Punjab indicated the
   urgent need of efficient planning of water resources. The study may
   guide planners and policy makers for effective implementation of the
   rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge strategies to improve the
   status of water resources in the entire Punjab.},

Title = {Assessing Rainfall Variability in Jamaica Using CHIRPS: Techniques and

Abstract = {Jamaica, as a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), is highly vulnerable
   to weather extremes. As precipitation persistence is a critical factor
   in determining the susceptibility of an area to risks, this work
   assesses the spatial and temporal variations of rainfall persistence in
   Jamaica from 1981 to 2020, using satellite-based information. The Hurst
   exponent (H) and the serial correlation coefficient (SCC) are used to
   evaluate the long-term persistence of precipitation and the Persistence
   Threshold (PT) concept is introduced to provide a description of
   rainfall characteristics over short periods, specifically, the number of
   consecutive days with precipitation above or below a set threshold
   value. The PT method is a novel concept that expands upon the
   Consecutive Dry Days (CDD) and Consecutive Wet Days (CWD) methods that
   only consider a threshold of 1 mm. Results show notable temporal and
   spatial variations in persistence over the decades, with an overall
   increasing trend in high precipitation persistence and a decreasing
   trend in low precipitation persistence. Geographically, the northern
   mountainous area of Jamaica received the most persistent rainfall over
   the study period with an observed increase in extreme rainfall events.
   The excess rainfall of the 2001-2010 decade is remarkable in this study,
   coinciding with the global unprecedented climate extremes during this
   time. We conclude that the data used in this study is viable for
   understanding and modeling rainfall trends in SIDS like Jamaica, and the
   derived PT method is a useful tool for short-term rainfall trends, but
   it is just one step toward determining flood or drought risk. Further
   research will focus on developing drought and flood indices.},

Title = {Retrieval Survey of Metals in Six Ultrahot Jupiters: Trends in

Abstract = {Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) has detected numerous
   chemical species and atmospheric dynamics in exoplanets, most notably
   ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs). However, quantitative estimates on abundances
   have been challenging but are essential for accurate comparative
   characterization and to determine formation scenarios. In this work, we
   retrieve the atmospheres of six UHJs (WASP-76 b, MASCARA-4 b, MASCARA-2
   b, WASP-121 b, HAT-P-70 b, and WASP-189 b) with ESPRESSO and
   HARPS-N/HARPS observations, exploring trends in eleven neutral species
   and dynamics. While Fe abundances agree well with stellar values, Mg,
   Ni, Cr, Mn, and V show more variation, highlighting the difficulty in
   using a single species as a proxy for metallicity. We find that Ca, Na,
   Ti, and TiO are underabundant, potentially due to ionization and/or
   nightside rain-out. Our retrievals also show that relative abundances
   between species are more robust, consistent with previous works. We
   perform spatially resolved and phase-resolved retrievals for WASP-76 b
   and WASP-121 b given their high signal-to-noise observations, and find
   the chemical abundances in each of the terminator regions are broadly
   consistent. We additionally constrain dynamics for our sample through
   Doppler shifts and broadening of the planetary signals during the
   primary eclipse, with median blueshifts between similar to 0.9 and 9.0
   km s(-1) due to day-night winds. Furthermore, we constrain spectroscopic
   masses for MASCARA-2 b and HAT-P-70 b consistent with their known upper
   limits, but we note that these may be biased due to degeneracies. This
   work highlights the importance of future HRS studies to further probe
   differences and trends between exoplanets.},

Title = {Assessment of hydro-climatic trends in a drought-prone region of
   Maharashtra (India) with reference to rainfed agriculture},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The present investigation endeavored to understand trends in climatic,
   hydrological, and agricultural variables in the five semi-arid river
   basins of Maharashtra (India). For this, parametric and non-parametric
   statistical techniques were applied. The monsoon rainfall over the study
   area reveals no considerable increase during the past (1981-2013) and
   future (2020-2050). Although the construction of a large number of
   impoundment structures during the last two decades resulted in a
   significant rise in post-monsoon groundwater table (by 40 cm/decade), it
   caused a decline in surface runoff. The study area witnessed a
   significant increase in area under irrigated crops at the cost of
   rainfed crops, which resulted in a significant increase in groundwater
   withdrawal (GWW) by 70 cm/decade. The cropped area and productivity of
   irrigated crops heavily depend on rainfall and groundwater resources.
   Moreover, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) has a positive connection
   with the productivity of irrigated crops. On the other hand, a
   considerable increase in annual minimum temperature (AMNT), annual
   maximum temperature (AMXT), and annual mean temperature (AMT) (by 1.02,
   0.50, and 0.82 degrees C, respectively) along with a rise of > 100 mm in
   potential evapotranspiration (PET) is registered during 1985-2015. The
   study indicates that the irrigated crops are more vulnerable to heat
   stress, as PHS (plant heat stress with > 34 degrees C) days show a
   considerable increase (2-5 days/decade). Furthermore, the climate
   projection suggest a significant rise of 1.05 degrees C in AMT by 2050,
   which is very likely to intensify the hydro-meteorological droughts and
   adversely affect the agricultural productivity of rainfed and irrigated
   crops as well. Briefly, the human-induced changes in cropping patterns
   (without a considerable increase in rainfall/water resource) from one
   side and the climatic changes (including extreme events) on the other
   side may exacerbate the regional water scarcity and food security
   challenges in the semi-arid region of Maharashtra (India) in the
   near-term future.},

Abstract = {Although the potential of traditional domestic rainwater harvesting
   systems (RWHSs) is easily determined, objective knowledge is required to
   determine their sustainability or scientific validity. We aimed to
   broadly review recent trends and emerging opportunities for research on
   the potential of RWHSs in the global context. We reviewed three types of
   representative RWHSs: water cellars, stepwells, and qanats. In total, 16
   potential categories were defined. First, to date, 50\% of the
   categories of potential have been demonstrated but are not considered
   beneficial, have been proven only in limited locations, only in limited
   sampling sets, or are theoretical. Second, whether the involvement of
   other disciplines has resulted in an expansion of the research scope or
   whether a particular potential has not been comprehensively explained
   remains to be determined by researchers. Third, potential that has
   emerged in the 21(st) century is not beyond our imagination such as
   tourism potential and ecological potential. Therefore, researchers
   should actively explore and incorporate new innovative technologies with
   RWHSs to explore new potential. The findings of this study offer a
   viable research framework for investigating the evolution of the
   discipline and contribute to the development of critical thinking in the
   analysis of the potential of RWHSs.},

Abstract = {Managing the impacts of rain and drought on agriculture depends on the
   degree of accurate monitoring of these effects. For accurate monitoring,
   this study investigated the impacts of rain and drought (using the
   reconnaissance drought index (RDI)) on agriculture during different
   moving periods (MPs) using various time scales (seasonal and annual).
   This investigation was done by estimating correlation coefficients (CC)
   between winter wheat yield and rain value (CCYR) and between yield and
   RDI index (CCYRDI), trend analysis of these CCs, and estimating
   correlation coefficients between the time series of the temporal trend
   of yield (TCY) and rain (TCR) and RDI (TCRDI). The results of
   considering CCYR indicated similar changes for Winter and Annual time
   scales and opposed changes for Autumn and Winter and for Spring and
   Winter. The results of considering CCYRDI indicated similar changes for
   Winter, Spring, and Annual time scales and opposed changes for Autumn.
   As the moving period increases from 10 to 20 years, the similarities
   increased and oppositeness decreased. The results of CCYR and CCYRDI
   trend analysis showed the reduction in these coefficients that generally
   indicate the reduction of effective rain for crop production and
   increase in drought during recent MPs.The results of estimating
   correlation coefficients between TCY and TCR indicate the importance of
   spring rainfall in the north and winter rainfall in the south of the
   study area. The results of estimating correlation coefficients between
   TCY and TCRDI indicated that the highest values of correlation
   coefficients, were obtained in the spring season.},

Title = {Supermarket trends for rainbow and steelhead trout products: Evidence
   from scanner data},
Journal = {AQUACULTURE REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Farm-raised trout is the second-largest foodfish sector of United States
   (U.S.) aquaculture, with the first trout farms established more than a
   century ago. Given its importance to both U.S. and global aquaculture,
   there is surprisingly little research on critical markets and marketing
   for trout in the U.S. Scanner data (AC Nielsen ScanTrack) were used for
   the time period from September 2016 through August 2021 to compare
   retail sales of the trout products sold across years at national,
   regional, and city levels to provide information on sales revenue,
   volumes sold, and prices. Supermarket sales of trout increased from
   \$100 to \$135 million from 2016 to 2021; the average annual growth rate
   of sales was 8.3\%. Trout prices were relatively stable over the study
   period in contrast to the generally increasing trends for seafood
   generally. The South Atlantic region was found to be the largest region
   for trout products and experienced a 13\% average annual growth in
   sales, but the fastest growth rate of sales (15\%) was observed in the
   West North Central region. The two top market regions for trout sales
   overall were Seattle/Tacoma and Portland Oregon, followed by Atlanta.
   Seventy-two percent of trout sales were of steelhead trout, with 26\% of
   rainbow trout. Rainbow trout prices increased by 12\% annually in
   contrast to those for steelhead trout that were relatively constant.
   This study highlighted the complexities of the U.S. retail trout market,
   with increasing volumes of imported steelhead and rainbow trout
   capturing the growing market demand for trout. Additional attention is
   needed to reduce barriers to expansion for U.S. trout farmers. Future
   studies that measure the substitutability of steelhead for rainbow trout
   in key markets as well as greater attention to food service sales to
   restaurants would provide useful marketing information for trout
   farmers.},

Abstract = {The agreement between meteorological data and societal perception is
   essential in supporting a robust policy making and its implementation.
   In humid tropic watersheds like Brantas, such consensus is important for
   water resources management and policies. This study exemplifies an
   effort to understand the long-term rainfall characteristics within the
   watershed and to build a common link among the differing data sources:
   CHIRPS rainfall satellite data, rain gauge data, and farmers
   perceptions. Six rainfall characteristics were derived using statistical
   measures from the scientific data and then were translated to a series
   of structured questionnaires given to small-scale farmers. A consensus
   matrix was built to examine the level of agreement among three data
   sources, supporting the spatial pattern of the meteorological data and
   farmers perception. Two rainfall attributes were classified with high
   agreement, four with moderate and one with low agreement. The agreements
   and discrepancies of rainfall characteristics were found in the study
   area. The discrepancies originated from the accuracy in translating
   scientific measurements to practical meanings for farmers, complexity of
   the farming system, the nature of phenomena in questions, and farmers'
   ability to record long-term climatic events. This study shows an
   implication that a combined approach to link scientific data and
   societal data is needed to support powerful climate policy making.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on the environment, particularly water
   resources, can never be over-emphasized. Therefore, it is imperative to
   continuously study and understand climate data, especially on a regional
   scale. This paper used the sites in the four nations' capitals in the
   United Kingdom as the study areas with extensive rainfall data collected
   from a total of six weather stations. The article is the first study
   conducted on extensive hourly rainfall data observed at selected weather
   stations in the four nations of the UK for exponentiality testing of
   their rainfall characteristics before carrying out a comprehensive
   comparative analysis of their distribution parameters and conducting
   event-based trend analysis to investigate the potential impact of
   climate change on the regional rainfall characteristics. Several earlier
   studies have considered separating continuous rainfall data into
   individual rainfall events as the most challenging and time-consuming
   aspect of rainfall data analysis. Therefore, first, this paper provided
   a step-by-step guide on rainfall event separation, especially for data
   with missing values, before conducting frequency analysis to test the
   exponentiality of rainfall event characteristics using large samples.
   The results from the study indicated that the rainfall event
   characteristics observed at the weather stations in the four nations of
   the UK were both exponentially and gammally distributed. The comparative
   analysis of the distribution parameters demonstrated that the observed
   rainfall data have heterogeneous spatial distributions. The event-based
   trend analysis showed an upward trend in the number of extreme rainfall
   events and the number of rainfall events per year in the observed data.
   However, there was no correlation between temperature and the rainfall
   characteristics, although, in a global context, a correlation is
   suggested.
   This paper established that taking effective and sustainable actions
   against the impacts of climate change on the environment, especially at
   the regional scale, requires a good understanding of climate data, their
   distributions, and trends.},

Title = {Factors responsible for the increasing trend of mei-yu season rainfall

Abstract = {The mei-yu season (June-July) rainfall over the mei-yu monitoring domain
   (MMD) in the Yangtze-Huaihe Basin has shown an increasing trend in
   recent decades. This study examines the dominant factors responsible for
   this increasing trend for the period 1979-2020 based on station-observed
   rainfall and ERA5 reanalysis datasets from the perspective of changes in
   atmospheric circulation. Although significantly increasing trends exist
   in the mei-yu season rainfall over the entire MMD, the magnitude of the
   trends is slightly larger over the eastern MMD (EMMD) than over the
   western MMD (WMMD). Quantitative diagnoses demonstrate that the relative
   contributions of anomalous evaporation and moisture advection to the
   increasing rainfall trend are different between the EMMD and WMMD. The
   increasing rainfall trend over the WMMD (EMMD) is attributable to
   increased evaporation (enhanced vertical moisture advection), which is
   dependent on an anomalous cyclonic circulation in the middle -lower
   troposphere over the MMD. Such an anomalous cyclone on the northwestern
   side of the climatological western North Pacific subtropical high
   facilitates an increase in moisture divergence above 600 hPa over the
   EMMD, leading to enhanced vertical moisture advection in conjunction
   with strengthened moisture convergence at 850 hPa. By contrast, the
   anomalous cyclone favors increasing local evaporation over the WMMD.},

   Northwest Australia},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Rainfall during the monsoon in northwest Australia has increased since
   the 1950s. Previous studies have explored possible causes of the
   rainfall increase; however, the trend has not been fully explained.
   Understanding the cause of this trend is important for interpreting
   climate projections and local water-sensitive services. We explore the
   role of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in explaining the rainfall
   increase. The MJO, since 1974, has had a longer duration in phases
   associated with enhanced rainfall in northwest Australia (Phases 5 and
   6) during the monsoon. We show that the rainfall trend in northwest
   Australia is identified only during MJO phases associated with enhanced
   rainfall, with a large change in daily rainfall distribution in these
   phases. The increasing occurrence of these MJO phases explains most of
   the rainfall increase, as opposed to an increase in daily rainfall
   independent of MJO phase, albeit with some sensitivity to MJO
   definition.
   Plain Language Summary Rainfall during the monsoon in northwest
   Australia has been increasing since the 1950s. In this study, we explore
   if a semi-periodic pulse of rainfall and clouds near the equator, known
   as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), may be related to the increased
   rainfall in the northwest. This pulse of clouds has been found, since
   1974, to be spending longer periods of time over northwest Australia. We
   observed that the increase in MJO duration over northern Australia leads
   to increasing rainfall in northwest Australia.},

Abstract = {This study investigates possible rainfall and drought trends using data
   from 38 rainfall stations in the Medjerda basin (northeast of Algeria)
   over 54 years (1965-2018). Drought-related data were calculated with the
   Standardized precipitation index (SPI). The Mann-Kendall test was used
   to find positive or negative precipitation trends. The magnitude of
   these trends was calculated using Sen's slope method. According to the
   analysis, a decrease during the spring precipitation season was
   observed. Furthermore, the authors found the maximum increasing
   (decreasing) precipitation magnitude to be 2.14 mm/season (- 4.41
   mm/season) in winter (spring). In addition, the magnitude of the
   precipitation trend per year ranged from - 6.26 to 2.54 mm/year, with an
   average reduction of 39\% for the entire basin. From the outcomes of
   drought trend analysis, it can be inferred that for a short-time scale,
   the innovative trend analysis method exhibited a negative trend for the
   minimum and maximum SPI values. Drought severity was found to have
   increased during severe and extreme wet episodes, directly affecting
   Algeria's frequently drought-affected agricultural regions, such as the
   Merdja plain and the irrigated perimeters of Sedrata and Zouabi.
   Considering the long-time scales, an increase was detected in drought
   severity and a decline during severe and extreme wet episodes. These
   findings show that the southeastern and central parts of the Medjerda
   basin's long-term water resources have been severely affected, which
   negatively impacts the newly-constructed Ouldjet Mellegue dam in Tebessa
   province.},

   Pre-cipitation Index (SPI) was used to generate SPI values and graphs.
   Our findings show that rainfall is on the declining trend in Gombe
   (z-value = -0.5930) and Kaduna (z-value = -2.520) but on increasing
   trend in Sokoto (z-value = 1.9272). Kaduna alone with P-value of 0.0117
   which is less than 0.05 level of significance showed monotonic declining
   trend. In Sokoto, even though there is an increase, it is not monotonic
   since the P-value of 0.0540 is greater than the significant value of
   0.05. The SPI values show only two extreme droughts in Kaduna in 2004
   and 2013 with SPI of-2.04 and-2.08 respectively. Some of the years
   experienced between moderate to severe drought in all the stations while
   near normal condition is predominant in all the stations. Apart from the
   only incidence of extreme flooding in Sokoto in 2019 with SPI of 2.755,
   there were a few incidences of severe wet-ness or moderate wetness for
   the other years in all the stations. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Local perceptions do not follow rainfall trends: A case study in

Abstract = {The great current challenge for the conservation and use of natural
   resources refers to global climate change, because of its impacts felt
   in different intensities at global, regional, and local spatial scales.
   Within the system of environmental protection areas in Brazil, the
   extractive re-serves ensure the sustainable use of natural resources by
   traditional populations, thus maintaining the cultural and biological
   aspects of a region. Such populations, being in close management of the
   surrounding environments, tend to perceive changes in ecological
   processes that many need for their livelihoods. The use of this
   perception of local populations in conjunction with academic research
   evidence has a high potential to allow a whole and systemic view of
   possible changes in natural phenomena. This study developed an
   integrated analysis of scientific evidence and local perceptions to
   understand the variation of precipitation in a community inserted in an
   extractive reserve in the eastern Amazon. We used 30 years of
   precipitation data from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology
   -INMET, the Southern Oscillation Index -SOI, and the Atlantic
   Merid-ional Mode Index -AMM. Furthermore, we applied a form to measure
   the population's perception of possible changes in rainfall cycles in
   the region. The meteorological data indicate that the region of the
   community has been presenting a rainfall reduction; however, people in
   the com-munity do not perceive this trend. Although it is public
   knowledge that the global climate is undergoing changes, a fact noted
   after the integrating analysis of scientific evidence with local
   knowledge in Resexmar Soure is that the perceptions of traditional
   populations often focus on smaller temporal and spatial scale visions.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Torrential rains occurred in Okayama in western Japan in
   July 2018, forcing local residents to evacuate. Few studies have
   reported early-phase disease and injury trends among patients following
   torrential rains. Thus, in this study, we assessed the illness and
   injury trends among patients who visited temporary medical facilities
   located in the areas affected by the 2018 torrential rains; these
   facilities opened 10 d after the disaster.Methods: We evaluated the
   trends among patients who visited a medical clinic located in the area
   in western Japan affected by heavy rains in 2018. We reviewed medical
   charts related to 1,301 outpatient visits and conducted descriptive
   analyses.Results: More than half of the patients were over 60 years old.
   The patients experienced mild injuries (7.9\% of total visits) as well
   as common diseases such as hypertensive diseases (30\%), diabetes
   mellitus (7.8\%), acute upper respiratory infections (5.4\%), skin
   diseases (5.4\%), and eye diseases (4.8\%). Hypertensive diseases were
   the main cause of a visit in any week. Eye problems were the
   second-highest reason for a visit in the first week, but there was a
   relative decrease from the first to the third week. Additionally, the
   proportion of injuries and skin diseases increased from the first to the
   second week, from 7.9\% to 11.1\% for injuries, and from 3.9\% to 6.7\%
   for skin diseases.Conclusions: The types of diseases changed on a weekly
   basis. Older adults needed medical support for longer than other age
   groups. Prior preparedness such as earlier deployment of such temporary
   clinics can help mitigate the damage to the victims.},

Title = {Long-term homogeneity and trend analysis of seasonality and extreme
   rainfall under the influence of climate change in Johor River basin,
   Malaysia},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {There is a growing concern over the unprecedented shifts in seasonality
   and extreme rainfall over the last century across the globe due to
   climate change. However, there is still a lack of basin-scale study in
   documenting trend, changes, and variation across Peninsular Malaysia and
   its relation with flood occurrence. Therefore, Johor River basin (JRB)
   which plays a pivotal role in the country's development was selected as
   a case study by evaluating 24 rainfall stations for homogeneity over the
   period 1970-2015 and followed by the analysis of rainfall seasonality
   and extreme rainfall trend. Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to show
   the area within JRB that is subjected to change at 95\% significance
   level. Even though 75\% of the stations had strong auto-correlation in
   the time series due to large-scale climate influence, the imputed
   rainfall stations showed no potential discontinuity with t-test
   statistics between 0.87 and 0.90 and R2 between 0.995 and 0.999 for the
   double mass curve of the yearly rainfall time series. The constructed
   PDF showed the restoration of the normal distribution of the rainfall
   data with higher peak as the missingness of the high-intensity rainfall
   has been restored. After that, a homogeneity test was conducted for
   annual and seasonal rainfall using a hybrid of Standard Normal
   Homogeneity test, Pettit test, Buishand Range test, and Von Neumann
   ratio test. The results showed that for the annual series, 43\% of the
   total stations were found to be `useful', but more `useful' stations
   based on the seasonal data, with 67\% and 52\% of the total stations for
   NE and SW monsoons, respectively. As no anthropogenic effect can be
   deduced, the presence of inhomogeneity in some stations is associated
   with the influence of high climate variability. Although non-significant
   change was observed, the seasonality index (SI) showed that the annual
   rainfall regime in JRB is mainly classified as `rather seasonal with a
   short drier season' (SI range from 0.39 to 0.47). Comparatively, the
   rainfall regime during the drier SW monsoon is more irregular (SI range
   from 0.67 to 0.72) than the wetter NE monsoon (SI range from 0.57 to
   0.68). Spatially, increasing SI was observed in the downstream area
   indicating increasing occurrence of extreme rainfall over a shorter
   period. For trend analysis, RClimDex was utilised to compute eleven
   extreme rainfall indices as recommended by ETCCDI, consisting of
   frequency and intensity extreme rainfall indices. Generally, the results
   showed that increasing extreme rainfall in the form of frequency indices
   is more prominent throughout JRB particularly at the end of the NE
   monsoon. During the NE monsoon, frequency index of R10 showed a
   significant increasing trend at thirteen stations. Meanwhile, R20 and
   R25 showed increasing trend at five stations, mainly in the downstream
   and at the west of the basin. During the SW monsoon, R10 showed a
   significant increasing trend at six stations, but R20 and R25 showed a
   significant decreasing trend at two and one station, respectively. Based
   on the past flood record, increasing trend of R10, R20, R25, and CWD
   during the NE monsoon across flood prone area in Sayong river, Kota
   Tinggi town and downstream urbanised area is expected to worsen the
   flood conditions, which required improved flood mitigation and
   adaptation strategy.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pacific islands have always been at the front of the great challenge of
   climate change. In this study, Mann-Kendall's tau-based slope estimator
   was implemented to detect statistical trends in daily maximum and
   minimum temperatures of 2 stations and daily rainfalls at 14 stations
   over Guam for the period of 1953-2021, respectively, with 17 climate
   change detection indices. Mann-Kendall tests were implemented to the
   detection indices with respect to different time frames (i.e., annual,
   two-seasonal, and four-seasonal). The p-values from Mann-Kendall tests
   were used to determine the strength of trends, and Sen's slopes were
   applied for the magnitudes of trends. The temperature trend analysis
   results indicate that Guam's climate is getting warmer year by year. The
   increasing magnitudes of a seasonal maximum of daily maximum
   temperatures during the dry season are 0.036 degrees C/year for the dry
   season and 0.025 degrees C/year for the wet season at Anderson Airforce
   Base, while 0.031 degrees C/year and 0.023 degrees C/year for the dry
   and wet seasons at Guam International Airport. Trend analyses for
   temperatures have indicated that temperature during April through June
   has been increasing rapidly compared to other seasons. Strong trends in
   seasonal total rainfall amounts and the number of wet days were observed
   from July through December. The increasing trends in extreme rainfall
   indices during January-March and July-September periods would aggravate
   water quality due to the more sediments since important ecological
   reserve areas and coral reef areas are linked to watersheds in southern
   Guam.},

Abstract = {Climate change is expected to impact on rainfall variability and lead to
   a substantial modification in rainfall amounts. In this study, the
   spatiotemporal variability of rainfall in Friuli-Venezia Giulia
   (north-eastern Italy) has been evaluated by means of 67 monthly series
   for the period 1940-2011. In particular, in order to analyse possible
   trends in rainfall series, two non-parametric tests for trend detection
   have been used. Moreover, the monthly rainfall distribution throughout
   the year was also investigated by means of the precipitation
   concentration index (PCI). In addition, a correlation analysis has been
   performed between seasonal rainfall and four of the most important
   teleconnection indices, i.e. the Western Mediterranean Oscillation Index
   (WeMOI), the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), the North Atlantic Oscillation
   Index (NAOI) and the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI). The results
   evidenced a reduction in rainfall amount, mainly detected in the spring
   and the summer months, and a positive trend in the PCI. The latter
   indicates a tendency towards a more seasonal rainfall distribution in
   the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region throughout the year. Finally, the WeMO
   was identified as the most relevant teleconnection over all of
   Friuli-Venezia Giulia in the different seasons.},

   (NCA). Trend analysis of monthly rainfall and groundwater levels between
   2012 and 2019 and their homogeneity were undertaken using the
   Mann-Kendal test, followed by the application of the water balance
   method to estimate runoff over the catchment between 2009 and 2019.
   Runoff and precipitation between the two periods were compared using
   paired t-tests. Investigations revealed that rainfall increased
   insignificantly, whereas groundwater depth generally increased
   significantly. The homogeneity test revealed a general insignificant
   increase in rainfall over NCA. No catchment-wide conclusions were
   obtained regarding groundwater depth increases. Water-balance computed
   runoff in 2019 was an increase of 13.7\% from that computed in 2009,
   despite the conservative 3\% increase in rainfall between the two
   periods. Increase in runoff could even be higher if land use changes
   were incorporated. This study revealed that there is groundwater
   recharge over the catchment, particularly after heavy rainfall events.
   The results of this study offer insights for identifying groundwater
   recharge potential zones, which could inform decision making with regard
   to strategies for induced groundwater recharge to replenish groundwater
   resources that can conjunctively be used with surface water resources.},

Title = {Orographic Effect and the Opposite Trend of Rainfall in Central Vietnam},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Month = {MAR 11},
Abstract = {Central Vietnam is characterized by severe flooding associated with
   heavy rainfall events caused by interactions between multiscale
   atmospheric circulations and the complex local terrain. Previous studies
   believed rainfall in central Vietnam is closely related to the cold
   surge; however, it fails to explain the cause of the early rainfall
   occurrence in August in the subregion. For the first time, this study
   investigates the detailed atmospheric mechanisms associated with
   rainfall variations in central Vietnam using the empirical orthogonal
   function (EOF) applied to the recently developed high-resolution Vietnam
   gridded precipitation (VnGP) dataset. Reanalysis data NCEP/NCAR is used
   to associate the rainfall changes with respective atmospheric
   mechanisms. EOF analysis detected two dominant rainfall modes. The
   primary mode explains the rainfall variation from October to November
   over the central and is directly related to the interaction of cold
   surges and tropical disturbances. The second mode accounts for rainfall
   occurring in north central from September to mid-October, which is
   attributed to the westerly summer monsoon activities. Also, we revealed
   that, while the first mode exhibits a significant correlation with El
   Nino-southern oscillation, the second depends highly on the contrast of
   sea surface temperature in the northern and southern Hemispheres. This
   different oceanic forcing and the local topological effect of Truong Son
   mountain range reasonably explain the opposite rainfall pattern in
   central Vietnam in early fall.},

Title = {Variability conceals emerging trend in 100yr projections of UK local
   hourly rainfall extremes},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Extreme precipitation is projected to intensify with warming, but how
   this will manifest locally through time is uncertain. Here, we exploit
   an ensemble of convection-permitting transient simulations to examine
   the emerging signal in local hourly rainfall extremes over 100-years. We
   show rainfall events in the UK exceeding 20 mm/h that can cause flash
   floods are 4-times as frequent by 2070s under high emissions; in
   contrast, a coarser resolution regional model shows only a 2.6x
   increase. With every degree of regional warming, the intensity of
   extreme downpours increases by 5-15\%. Regional records of local hourly
   rainfall occur 40\% more often than in the absence of warming. However,
   these changes are not realised as a smooth trend. Instead, as a result
   of internal variability, extreme years with record-breaking events may
   be followed by multiple decades with no new local rainfall records. The
   tendency for extreme years to cluster poses key challenges for
   communities trying to adapt.
   Climate projections at km-scale show that local hourly precipitation
   extremes in the UK become 4-times more frequent by 2070, while they do
   not intensify gradually with warming, but tend to cluster in time.},

Abstract = {This research studied the risk assessment of geological hazards, such as
   landslides and debris flow, under the time series and trend
   characteristics of extreme precipitation events in the last 60 years in
   nine typical regions of the lower Jinshajiang River Basin. Nine
   indicators, including slope, engineering geological rock group, slope
   structure type, distance to road, topographic relief, distance to fault,
   distance to the water system, vegetation cover and profile curvature,
   were selected as the index factors for landslide susceptibility
   evaluation, and the information quantity method was used to obtain the
   landslide susceptibility evaluation of the study area. Based on the
   susceptibility evaluation, the spatial analysis function of GIS was used
   to derive the geological hazard zoning under the extreme rainfall trend.
   The results showed that the areas with high extreme rainfall trends have
   higher densities of geological hazard development and they are
   concentrated, while areas with low extreme rainfall trends have
   relatively less geological hazard development, and what development
   exists is scattered.},

Title = {Diverging Trends in Rain-On-Snow Over High Mountain Asia},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rain-on-snow (ROS) over snow-dominated regions such as High Mountain
   Asia (HMA) modulates snowmelt and runoff and is key contributor in
   influencing water availability and hazards (e.g., floods and
   landslides). We studied the trends in ROS in HMA over the past two
   decades from 2001 to 2018 using the land surface model Noah-MP driven by
   an ensemble precipitation data set. Our results show that changes in
   precipitation phase and rainfall are altering ROS. Because of the strong
   physical heterogeneity and atmospheric dynamics of HMA, ROS
   characteristics and trends are region-dependent and ROS occurs
   predominantly over the Indus, Ganges-Brahmaputra, and northwestern
   basins. In the Indus, ROS representing similar to 5\% of the annual
   precipitation and similar to 20\% of the annual snowmelt, has an
   increasing trend. This is contrary to the Ganges-Brahmaputra
   characterized by decreasing ROS trends, where it represents similar to
   11\% of the annual precipitation and similar to 60\% of the annual
   snowmelt. In the northwestern basins, ROS has bidirectional trends due
   to elevation patterns and trends in rainfall, and it constitutes similar
   to 5 to similar to 10\% of the annual precipitation. Increasing trends
   in ROS over Indus contribute to reducing the snowpack in late summer,
   with concerns of reduced water availability and increased groundwater
   exploitation. Similarly, because of its high amount and contribution to
   snowmelt, the decreasing ROS trends in the Ganges-Brahmaputra will have
   consequences of decreased recharge from the headwaters and exacerbated
   use of groundwater unless increasing trends in rainfall compensate for
   the decreasing snowmelt. These results provide new insights on
   ROS-driven changes in the hydrological cycle over HMA.},

Abstract = {The long-term trends in the occurrence frequency of pre-summer daytime
   and nocturnal extreme hourly rainfall (EXHR) during 1988-2018 in Hong
   Kong and their spatial distributions are examined and analyzed. Despite
   a significant increasing trend observed in the occurrence frequency of
   pre-summer EXHRs during the investigated period, the increase in daytime
   and nocturnal EXHRs show distinct spatial patterns. Nocturnal EXHRs show
   uniform increasing trends over the entire Hong Kong. However, the
   increase in daytime EXHRs is concentrated over the northern or eastern
   areas of Hong Kong, indicating a downstream shift of pre-summer EXHRs in
   Hong Kong with regard to the prevailing southwesterly monsoonal flows in
   south China. The clustering of weather types associated with daytime and
   nocturnal EXHRs further reveals that the increase in EXHRs over Hong
   Kong are mainly contributed by the increase of the events associated
   with southwesterly monsoonal flows with relatively high speeds. During
   the past few decades, the southwesterly monsoonal flows at coastal south
   China have undergone a substantial weakening due to the increased
   surface roughness induced by the urbanization over the Guangdong-Hong
   Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area since 1990s, leading to enhanced low-level
   convergence and thus significant increase in EXHRs at coastal south
   China. Meanwhile, daytime sea-wind circulation at coastal south China is
   markedly enhanced during the investigated period, which is the main
   reason for the northward shift of daytime EXHRs in Hong Kong. In
   addition, the blocked southwesterly monsoonal flows at coastal south
   China are detoured eastward, leading to stronger convergence and
   increase in EXHRs at eastern coast of when the sea winds at the region},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of rainfall is often carried out in water resources
   management to understand its distribution over a given region. The
   cumulative seasonal and annual rainfall derived from monthly datasets
   spanning 102 years (1901-2002) for 11 districts of the semi-arid
   Karnataka, India, was used for the trend analysis. The two-step
   homogeneous test approach was carried out on all the time series. Then,
   lag-1 autocorrelation was conducted only on homogeneous time series.
   Only 78.18 \% of the total time series data were detected as
   homogeneous, and 95.35\% of time series data were found to have
   insignificant autocorrelation. Then, the Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA)
   method was applied to 43 homogeneous rainfall time series, as well as to
   41 time series using the MK and SR tests, and to two time series using
   the mMK test. The MK and SR tests detected a significant trend in
   14.63\% of the time series, while the ITA method was able to detect a
   trend in 93.02\% of the total time series data. The MK and SR tests
   revealed significant trends in winter and post-monsoon season
   precipitation for two districts, but only for one district in the case
   of summer and annual rainfall. No trend was identified for monsoon
   season precipitation. The mMK test showed a positive trend for the
   post-monsoon season in a district, while the ITA method revealed
   significant trends for all seasons in most districts. The sub-trend
   analysis revealed trends that traditional methods were unable to detect.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Rainfall Variability and Trend Analysis of Shimsha River
   Basin, India},

Abstract = {Karnataka state has the second highest rainfed agricultural land in
   India, where agricultural output relies heavily on rainfall. The Shimsha
   basin, a sub-basin of Cauvery in the state, comes under a semi-arid
   region and predominantly consists of rainfed agricultural land. Rainfall
   patterns have changed dramatically with time resulting in frequent
   floods and droughts. Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of
   rainfall and its change patterns in the area would benefit sustainable
   agriculture planning and water resources management practices. The
   current study aims to determine the variability and trend in rainfall.
   The daily rainfall data of the Shimsha basin from 1989 to 2018 is
   collected, and the annual, seasonal, and monthly rainfall totals and the
   number of rainy days are derived. All the time series are subjected to
   statistical methods to examine rainfall variability and trend. The mean,
   standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), and Standardized
   Anomaly Index are used for the preliminary and variability analysis,
   while the coefficient of skewness and kurtosis are used to understand
   the rainfall distribution characteristics. The homogenous and serially
   independent series are identified by homogeneity and serial correlation
   tests. The trend in the homogenous and serially independent series is
   identified by Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rank correlation tests, while
   the magnitude of the trend is quantified using the Sen's slope
   technique, and the trend change point is evaluated using the sequential
   Mann-Kendall test. Based on the study, the average rainfall in the study
   area is 801.86 mm, with CV ranging from 43.3 to 22.27\%. The southwest
   monsoon (SWM) season brings the greatest rain to the basin, followed by
   the post-monsoon (PM), summer, and winter seasons. In the annual time
   frame, except one station, all other stations have shown significant or
   insignificant increasing trends. The seasonal rainfall has shown
   insignificant rising trends during the summer and winter seasons while
   insignificant increasing and decreasing trends during the PM season. The
   SWM season has indicated significant increasing trends, insignificant
   increasing and decreasing trends. Overall, the study area has noticed an
   increased annual and seasonal rainfall except for the post-monsoon
   season, during which the rainfall showed a considerable decline. The
   findings of the study are helpful in water resource management,
   agricultural planning, and socioeconomic development in the study area.},

Abstract = {It is known that the rainfall is one of the major aspects of the climate
   change and hydrological processes. Its impact on the resources of water
   has always been considered very essential. In the countries like
   Pakistan having severe weather conditions the effect of rainfall can be
   more cru-cial. Due to the geographical differences, the impact of sudden
   rainfall can be more disastrous in Pakistan as in 2011 and 2022 only the
   few days' extreme rainfall in summer monsoon dis-turbed many regions of
   Pakistan especially southern region of Pakistan and lost hundreds of
   lives and homes. In addition, there are two methods applied for this
   study (1) trend analysis and (2) probability distribution functions. Our
   results revealed that only three cities i.e. Chitral, Skardu and Gilgit
   having increasing as well as the station Sialkot have increasing trend
   pattern in only summer rainfall, and other all have shown decreasing
   trend overall. Furthermore, key extreme weather events over Pakistan
   have changed in frequency and intensity during the past decades due to
   significant increase in global warming. The methods and results will be
   useful to study the historical rainfall data for projecting future
   rainfall variations impact on hydrological processes due to climate
   change. center dot The Data, methods and results of this study can be

Title = {Detection Framework of Abrupt Changes and Trends in Rainfall Erosivity
   in Three Gorges Reservoir, China},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Rainfall erosivity is commonly used to estimate the probability of soil
   erosion caused by rainfall. The accurate detection of temporal changes
   in rainfall erosivity and the identification of abrupt changes and
   trends are important for understanding the physical causes of variation.
   In this study, a detection framework is introduced to identify temporal
   changes in rainfall erosivity time series as follows: (i) The
   significance of time series variation of rainfall erosivity is assessed
   based on the Hurst coefficient and divided into three levels: None,
   medium, and high. (ii) The detection of abrupt changes (Mann-Kendall,
   Moving T, and Bayesian tests) and trends (Spearman and Kendall rank
   correlation tests) of variate series and the correlation coefficient
   between the variation component and the original series is calculated.
   (iii) The modified series is obtained by preferentially eliminating the
   variation component (trend or change point) with larger correlation
   coefficients. (iv) We substituted the modified series into steps i to
   iii until the correlation coefficient was not significant. This
   framework is used to analyze the variation of rainfall erosivity in the
   Three Gorges Reservoir, China. The results showed that by using
   traditional methods, both an increasing trend and an upward change point
   were observed in Zigui station. However, after the upward change point
   was deducted from the annual rainfall erosivity series R(t), the
   resultant R-m(t) showed no statistically significant trend. Trend
   analysis should be performed considering the existence of an abrupt
   change to assess the long-term changes in rainfall erosivity series;
   otherwise, it would result in the wrong conclusion. In addition, the
   change points detected in the R-m(t) varied with the methods. Compared
   with the single-test method, the proposed framework can effectively
   reduce uncertainty.},

Abstract = {In this study, an objective monitoring method is proposed to define the
   Tibetan Plateau rainy season, based on daily precipitation and
   precipitation frequency. Then the climatic characteristics and changing
   trends of the onset, end, duration, and precipitation amount of the
   rainy season from 1961 to 2019 are investigated. The results show that
   the rainy season on the Tibetan Plateau begins earlier in the east than
   in the west but ends earlier in the west than in the east. Therefore,
   the duration of the rainy season shortens from the east to the west, and
   the total precipitation is higher in the east than in the west. The
   Tibetan Plateau rainy season lasts 163 days from May 4 to October 15
   climatically. The average total amount of precipitation during the rainy
   season is 413.2 mm. From 1961 to 2019, the Tibetan Plateau rainy season
   changed significantly, starting earlier and ending later, with longer
   duration and more precipitation. The change in the rainy season is not
   uniform across the Tibetan Plateau. The onset of the rainy season
   advanced across most Tibetan Plateau, but the magnitude of change is
   small in the eastern fringe. The end of the rainy season advanced in the
   north and south but was postponed in the center and east. The rainy
   season precipitation increased in most areas of the Tibetan Plateau but
   decreased in some areas of the southern margin.},

Abstract = {In this study, auto-correlated Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope
   estimator tests were utilized to determine trends of rainfall,
   temperatures, and characteristics of crop-growing season during
   1980-2009. Moreover, the Van Belle and Hughes' for homogeneity of
   general trend and Pettitt's test for the occurrence of abrupt changes
   were applied. On monthly, Kiremt (June-September) and annual time scale,
   the MK-trend test for rainfall exhibited non-significant increasing
   trend, while in Belg (February-May) rainfall season exhibited
   non-significant decreasing trend at the most of the stations. On the
   contrary, temperatures showed significant increasing trends in annual
   and Belg at the 5\% significant level. In Kiremt season, however, the
   maximum temperature showed non-significant increasing, while the minimum
   temperature showed non-significant decreasing trend. Results of
   homogeneity for general trend obtained by the Van Belle and Hughes' test
   seem fairly consistent with those of the MK-trend test. Moreover,
   results of Pettitt's test indicated a homogeneous trend in monthly,
   annual, and seasonal rainfall series and no break point was
   distinguished, except few stations. On the contrary, the abrupt changes
   were found to be quite variable in temperatures. The study also found
   that trends of growing season characteristics (June-September) have not
   changed significantly at the 5\% significant level. Nevertheless, the
   high coefficient of variation in Kiremt rainfall (21-31\%) as well as
   dry spell length (25-43\%) in conjunction with the short nature of the
   length of growing period (68-90 days) had negative implications to crop
   production in the eastern zone of Tigray region.},

Abstract = {Climate extremes are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the
   future, owing to rising greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.
   Using appropriate trend indices, this study intends to analyze the
   effects of climate change on rainfall variability and extreme rainfall
   events in the millennium city of Mumbai. The analysis was carried out
   for the period 1985-2020 for 2 stations and 23 stations were selected
   (2006-2020) later from the dense rain gauge network of Municipal
   Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). To comprehend the trend and
   behaviour of rainfall and extreme events, three statistical models were
   used: Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, and simple linear
   regression; for abrupt change point detection, Pettitt's test, standard
   normal homogeneity test, Buishand's range test, and von Neumann ratio
   test were used. The results indicated that average annual rainfall in
   the study area is 2208.82 mm which is increasing at the rate of 5.18
   mm/year (at 99\% confidence level). The frequency of heavy (> 120
   mm/day) and extreme heavy rainfall events (250 mm/day) increased over
   Santacruz after 1994 and in the case of Colaba, it increased after 2005.
   The examination of rainfall and temperature data series for abrupt
   change point identification suggests that several change points exist,
   with the highest change points occurring between 2001 and 2005. Extreme
   climate event scenarios shown here could have large-scale negative
   consequences for the ecosystem and ecological resources of the study
   area.},

Title = {Secular trend in water discharge transport in the Lower Mekong
   River-delta: Effects of multiple anthropogenic stressors, rainfall, and
   tropical cyclones},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {281},
Month = {FEB 5},
Abstract = {The Mekong River is one of the world's most important continental
   rivers, and provides invaluable water re-sources for the survival and
   social development of nearly 70 million inhabitants of Southeast Asia.
   However, little work has been carried out on the multiforcing-induced
   hydrological behavior of the Lower Mekong River -delta (LMR) over the
   past 100 years. Here, the secular variations in water discharge were
   analyzed for seven gauging stations along the main stream of the LMR
   from the 1920s-2019, to identify the riverine hydrological mechanisms
   under different dynamic conditions. The results show that the water
   discharge delivered by the LMR to the delta decreased on both 50-year
   and centennial scales. Meanwhile, the daily water discharge of the
   LMR-delta has become more evenly distributed intra-annually, leading to
   ``no flood in the flood season, no drought in the dry season{''} in this
   reach. While regional rainfall dominates the long-term variations in the
   water discharge in the LMR, episodic tropical cyclones can induce a
   gradual increase with enlarged spatial divergences in water discharge
   from the mountainous region to the delta by bringing heavy rainfall.
   Moreover, although the operation of the mega dams in the Upper Mekong
   Basin has significantly influenced the distribution of the downstream
   water discharge in the dry season, minor impacts can also be found in
   the wet season. The water consumption for irrigation was increased from
   the upstream to the downstream basin, which may contribute to the severe
   reduction in the downstream water discharge, even though typhoons
   induced much more runoff along the downstream reach. Considering future
   climate change in Southeast Asia with potential upward trends in
   anthropogenic stressors, it can be expected that the water discharge of
   the LMR-delta could worsen, and urgent countermeasures that address
   water resource management should be strongly considered by
   decision-makers in the affected countries of the Mekong River-delta.},

Title = {Assessment of Long-Term Rainfall Variability and Trends Using Observed
   and Satellite Data in Central Punjab, Pakistan},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This study explores the spatio-temporal distribution and trends on
   monthly, seasonal, and annual scales of rainfall in the central Punjab
   districts of Punjab province in Pakistan by using observation and
   satellite data products. The daily observed data was acquired from the
   Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) between 1983 and 2020, along with
   one reanalysis, namely the Climate Hazard Infrared Group Precipitation
   Station (CHIRPS) and one satellite-based daily Precipitation Estimation
   from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks
   climate data record (PERSIANN-CDR) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE)
   web-based API platform to investigate the spatio-temporal fluctuations
   and inter-annual variability of rainfall in the study domain. Several
   statistical indices were employed to check the data similarity between
   observed and remotely sensed data products and applied to each district.
   Moreover, non-parametric techniques, i.e., Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's
   slope estimator were applied to measure the long-term spatio-temporal
   trends. Remotely sensed data products reveal 422.50 mm (CHIRPS) and
   571.08 mm (PERSIANN-CDR) mean annual rainfall in central Punjab. Maximum
   mean rainfall was witnessed during the monsoon season (70.5\%), followed
   by pre-monsoon (15.2\%) and winter (10.2\%). Monthly exploration
   divulges that maximum mean rainfall was noticed in July (26.5\%), and
   the minimum was in November (0.84\%). The district-wise rainfall
   estimation shows maximum rainfall in Sialkot (931.4 mm) and minimum in
   Pakpattan (289.2 mm). Phase-wise analysis of annual, seasonal, and
   monthly trends demonstrated a sharp decreasing trend in Phase-1,
   averaging 3.4 mm/decade and an increasing tendency in Phase-2, averaging
   9.1 mm/decade. Maximum seasonal rainfall decreased in phase-1 and
   increased Phase-2 during monsoon season, averaging 2.1 and 4.7
   mm/decade, whereas monthly investigation showed similar phase-wise
   tendencies in July (1.1 mm/decade) and August (2.3 mm/decade). In
   addition, as district-wise analyses of annual, seasonal, and monthly
   trends in the last four decades reveal, the maximum declined trend was
   in Sialkot (18.5 mm/decade), whereas other districts witnessed an
   overall increasing trend throughout the years. Out of them, Gujrat
   district experienced the maximum increasing trend in annual terns (50.81
   mm/decade), and Faisalabad (25.45 mm/decade) witnessed this during the
   monsoon season. The uneven variability and trends have had a crucial
   imprint on the local environment, mainly in the primary activities.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is a key component of the water cycle, and its variability is
   important for both scientific and socio-economic considerations. In the
   present analysis, the temporal variability of precipitation has been
   investigated on a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis for Surat District
   of Gujarat State of India. In order to develop rainfall trend, analysis
   has been conducted using different indices for 118 years of
   precipitation data (1901-2018). This study revealed that in annual
   precipitation there is a positive trend since 2003. A large seasonality
   is observed for the region and nearly all precipitation is coming during
   the southwest monsoon. The standard precipitation index (SPI) and
   rainfall anamoly analysis (RAI) indicated that the study area does not
   have the threat of drought conditions. The multi-statistical method
   approach and rigorous interpretation will be useful to readers across
   the globe to solve issues. Crop water management, flood management,
   storm-water management, and water balance studies require rainfall
   analysis. Hence, this study is useful to carry on further research on

   with period around 11-18 years was visualised during the comprehensive
   rainfall pattern analysis. This rudimentary pattern could possibly be
   linked to the `solar cycles'. The outcome can credibly be used in
   framing local and region-specific medium-term plans of 11-15 years
   duration for water resources planning to adapt and cope up with
   rain-deficient and flood years. Development of robust trend analysis

Journal = {VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {183-198},
Abstract = {This study examines the characteristics and trends of extreme rainfall
   in Northern Vietnam from 1961 to 2018, using daily rainfall data
   collected from 37 meteorological stations. The study reveals that the
   average annual rainfall varies significantly across stations, ranging
   from 1140 mm to 4758 mm. The rainy season accounts for 73\% to 92\% of
   the total annual rainfall. Most stations show a declining trend in the
   annual total rainfall during wet days (PRCPTOT) and the number of wet
   days (WDAY), while rainfall intensity (SDII) has increased in most
   stations, particularly during the dry season. This can be attributed to
   an increase in PRCPTOT and a decrease in WDAY in the dry season. The
   study also finds a general decreasing trend in the annual maximum 1-day
   precipitation (RX1day) and consecutive 5-day precipitation (RX5day), as
   well as for the number of moderate (R16mm) and heavy (R50mm) rainfall
   days. However, most stations in Northern Vietnam demonstrate no trend in
   the annual maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD) and the annual
   maximum number of consecutive wet days (CWD). Furthermore, the frequency
   of extreme rainfall events in Northern Vietnam exceeding the 5-year and
   10-year return values of 1961-2018 has decreased in recent decades at
   many stations. Overall, the findings of this study provide insights into
   the changing patterns of extreme rainfall in Northern Vietnam, with
   significant implications for climate change adaptation and disaster risk
   reduction efforts in the region.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is one of the dominating climatic parameters that affect water
   availability. Trend analysis is of paramount significance to understand
   the behavior of hydrological and climatic variables over a long
   timescale. The main aim of the present study was to identify trends and
   analyze existing linkages between rainfall and streamflow in the Nilwala
   River Basin (NRB) of Southern Sri Lanka. An investigation of the trends,
   detection of change points and streamflow alteration, and linkage
   between rainfall and streamflow were carried out using the Mann-Kendall
   test, Sen's slope test, Pettitt's test, indicators of hydrological
   alteration (IHA), and Pearson's correlation test. Selected
   rainfall-related extreme climatic indices, namely, CDD, CWD, PRCPTOT,
   R25, and Rx5, were calculated using the RClimdex software. Trend
   analysis of rainfall data and extreme rainfall indices demonstrated few
   statistically significant trends at the monthly, seasonal, and annual
   scales, while streamflow data showed non-significant trends, except for
   December. Pettitt's test showed that Dampahala had a higher number of
   statistically significant change points among the six rainfall stations.
   The Pearson coefficient correlation showed a strong-to-very-strong
   positive relationship between rainfall and streamflow. Generally, both
   rainfall and streamflow showed non-significant trend patterns in the
   NRB, suggesting that rainfall had a higher impact on streamflow patterns
   in the basin. The historical trends of extreme climatic indices
   suggested that the NRB did not experience extreme climates. The results
   of the present study will provide valuable information for water
   resource planning, flood and disaster mitigation, agricultural
   operations planning, and hydropower generation in the NRB.},

Abstract = {Roseto R., Dellino P., Schena P., Capolongo D., Spatial distribution and
   trend analysis of extreme rainfall time series in Apulia region (
   Italy). (IT ISSN 0391-9838, 2023). Extreme rainfall events have been
   extensively studied at different spatial scales over the Mediterranean
   and Italian territory. Different interactions between atmospheric
   disturbances and morphological features have been found, mainly
   depending on precipitation duration and geo-graphical position. While
   climate change is shown to be responsible for the increase of frequency
   and intensity of extreme rainfall, the analysis of temporal trends at
   the national scale does not show significant variations and calls for
   more detailed studies. The main purposes of this study were both to
   investigate how the main geographical features of Apulia region
   controlled the spatial distribution of the extreme precipitations of
   short duration and to carry on a time-series analysis. The parameters of
   the Depth-Duration-Frequency (DDF) curves were correlated to elevation,
   latitude, longitude, distance from the sea and aspect by means of both
   Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. A wide range of
   duration were considered, spanning from 1 hour to 5 days. The
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test was used as to demonstrate the
   significance of trend analysis. Multiple Linear Regression shows to
   overperform the Simple Linear Regression results, revealing that
   elevation has the strongest correlation with the DDF parameters,
   followed by longitude and distance from the sea. A slight increase of
   the sub-daily precipitation and a decrease of the multi- daily
   precipitation results from trend analysis, whereas no significant
   differences emerged during the climate normal 1991-2020. A set of maps
   are also presented as to point out the occurrence of local anomalies
   related either to the spatial variation of the DDF parameters and to the
   temporal trend direction. The outcomes of this study reveal the growing
   importance of this type of analysis, as well as the differences
   resulting from performing Simple and Multiple Linear Regression over
   time series related to a wide range of rainfall duration.},

Abstract = {Climate model is an effective medium to study climate system and climate
   change. Its simulation results are essentially a crucial data basis for
   climate prediction and climate change risk assessment. With the
   acceleration of global warming, the surface ecological environment,
   hydrological dynamic cycle process, social and economic development are
   all affected thereupon, resulting in certain influence on the production
   and life of human beings. In this regard, this paper conducts a study on
   extreme precipitation events of different climate models with Yanhe
   River Basin as the study area. The results show that: 1. Yanhe River
   Basin is a sensitive area to climate change. In the future, the
   precipitation in this area, for a long time will not increase obviously,
   but fluctuate greatly; 2. The temporal and spatial difference of extreme
   precipitation events in the study area is significant. From 2000 to
   2050, the interdecadal fluctuation of extreme precipitation events in
   the study area is significant. In the future, the area with the largest
   volume of precipitation above 12mm will be concentrated in the southeast
   part of the study area, followed by the western boundary area; 3. There
   are few areas with precipitation above 50mm in the Yanhe River Basin,
   and the occurrence frequency has decreased significantly; 4. The
   simulation results of different climate models are different. Alao,
   pursuant to the data analysis results, different models have certain
   differences in the spatial simulation of extreme precipitation. It is
   speculated that the terrain factors and Monsoon Simulation factors may
   affect the simulation results of extreme precipitation events.},

Title = {Trends and variability of rainfall characteristics influencing annual
   streamflow: A case study of southeast Australia},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1407-1430},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The trend and variability in rainfall characteristics that influence
   annual streamflow of southeast Australia is assessed using two methods,
   non-parametric Kendall test and linear slope, and two gridded daily
   rainfall datasets (SILO and AWAP) and 1,196 station rainfall data for
   1971-2021 period. The rainfall anomaly before, during and after the
   Millennium Drought (1997-2009) is compared to quantify the variability.
   The results show: (a) a declining rainfall trend is detected as the
   recent dry decades were preceded by wet decades. The declining trend
   largely occurs from autumn through to spring with the largest trend in
   August to October followed by April and May; (b) the trend is more
   significant for number of rainfall days and for multi-day rainfall
   totals (and more so for longer accumulations) than for annual rainfall;
   (c) the very high extreme rainfall shows a small increasing trend in
   summer and mixed signal in the other seasons; (d) the streamflow in the
   post drought period is lower than the long-term mean, despite the mean
   annual rainfall being slightly higher. This can be partly explained by
   the rainfall-runoff relationship of catchments not having fully
   recovered from the prolonged drought and partly by changes in rainfall
   characteristics, like the wet spell length and multi-day rainfall,
   influencing annual streamflow; (e) The general conclusions for analyses
   with different sources of daily rainfall data are the same. However,
   some differences do exist, with SILO gridded rainfall and station data
   having larger areas with statistically significant trend than the AWAP
   gridded rainfall, as well as larger declining trends in the high
   elevation areas. The general conclusions of this study are drawn from an
   Australia case study but could have implications for other regions to
   investigate the attributions of rainfall characteristics other than
   annual rainfall to the non-stationary rainfall-streamflow relationship.},

Abstract = {The rainfrogs of the genus Pristimantis are one of the most diverse
   groups of vertebrates, with outstanding reproductive modes and
   strategies driving their success in colonizing new habitats. The rate of
   Pristimantis species discovered annually has increased continuously
   during the last 50 years, establishing the remarkable diversity found in
   this genus. In this paper the specifics of publications describing new
   species in the group are examined, including authorship, author gender,
   year, language, journal, scientific collections, and other details.
   Detailed information on the descriptions of 591 species of Pristimantis
   published to date (June 2022) were analyzed and extracted. John D. Lynch
   and William E. Duellman are the most prolific authors, yet Latin
   American researchers have scaled up and continued the description
   processes since the 1990s. The most common language used for
   descriptions is English, followed by Spanish. The great majority of
   authors have described only one species. The largest proportion of
   authors who have participated in the descriptions is of Ecuadorian
   nationality. Ecuador is the country with the highest description rate
   per year (3.9\% growth rate). Only 20\% of the contributions have
   included women and only 2\% have featured women as principal authors.
   36.8\% of the species described are in the Not Evaluated or Data
   Deficient categories under the IUCN global red list. The importance of
   enhancing the descriptions in Spanish is emphasized and the inclusion
   based on equal access to opportunities for female researchers in
   Pristimantis taxonomy is encouraged. In general, if the current trends

Abstract = {The current study focuses on the altering historical rainfall data
   analysis and its variability in Kolkata (Kolkata Municipal Corporation),
   a metropolitan city in India. The research area experiences detrimental
   urban floods (pluvial floods) at near-annual regularity during the
   monsoon, and during the pre-monsoon seasons it commonly experiences
   water shortage problems. Analysing trends and temporal variability of
   rainfall over 120 years from 1901 to 2020 is the main objective of this
   study. The original Mann-Kendall (M-K) test has been applied to the
   rainfall dataset in conjunction with Sen's Slope Estimator using Python
   3.10, after the Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic initially suggested that
   there is no serial correlation effect. The M-K test, with a Kendall's
   tau of 0.17058 (significant at a 5\% level), shows an upward trend in
   annual rainfall between 1901 and 2020. The Sen's slope, which measures
   the rate of change annually, has a value of 2.48152. Regression analysis
   and other dispersion measures are also used in this study to investigate
   the monthly rainfall trend and its variability. The phase-wise (30-year)
   analysis of annual rainfall variability reveals a considerable variation
   over 120 years. While fitting the linear regression line month by month
   over the entire period, mostly negative trends were found in the
   pre-monsoon and positive trends in the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.
   The findings of this analysis could be useful to urban planners for
   water supply and management in the study area. The primary concern of
   planners for effectively managing rainwater and the accompanying issues
   should be the growing variability of annual precipitation.},

Abstract = {Precipitation is one of the main factors causing surface, linear and
   landslide erosion. Their influence on erosion processes is determined by
   such parameters as: precipitation frequency, amount, duration and
   intensity. These features affect the rate of infiltration and the
   intensity of surface runoff, and thus the occurrence, course and
   effectiveness of erosion processes {[}2, 3, 4].The aim of research was
   to analyse the 40-years of rainfall measurements data from the Lubuskie
   Voivodeship and inspect whether occurring of heavy rains are random
   events or maybe indicate some long period trends. To analysis was used
   non-parametrical Mann-Kendall test and correlation test.What is more the
   authors' prepared a path of selecting the optimal dewatering system,
   where would be taken into consideration ground stability and changes in
   the rainfall trends. For this purpose, the paper contain short overview
   existing dewatering systems which are used to reducing risk of
   landslides.},

Title = {Impact of Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole on rainfall
   variability over India: trends and interlinkages during 1871-2017},
Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {134},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This investigation highlights changes and various facets of
   inter-connections between rainfall over India and its prominent drivers
   such as Southern Oscillation (SO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). As the
   monsoon rainfall over majority of sub-divisions from Northeast India
   (NEI) and Central Northeast India regions (53\% area) exhibits declining
   trend, which are reflected in annual rainfall (AR) as well. On the
   contrary, during the post-1971 period, the post-monsoon rainfall is
   observed to be decreasing over all the regions, except Peninsular India
   (PI). Moreover, the contradictory trends in monsoon and post-monsoon
   rainfall are registered over the PI, Northwest India (NWI) and West
   Central India regions. The significant increase in IOD (warming over
   Arabian Sea) is observed with a swift rise after 1960. Under changing
   climate conditions, a decline in rainfall and an increase in IOD Index
   (IODI) may aggravate the water scarcity challenge in semi-arid regions.
   More than 70\% of sub-divisions has positive and negative relationship
   of SO with monsoon and post-monsoon rainfall, respectively. This
   contradiction is particularly observed over PI Region, which led to
   weaker SO-AR relationship. As compared to SO-rainfall relationship,
   almost opposite picture is observed in the case of sub-divisional and
   regional rainfall (monsoon and post-monsoon)-IOD relationship. The SO-AR
   relationship displays epochs of weak (1941-1970 and 1995-2016) and
   strong (1871-1941 and 1970-1995) connections. Interestingly, the
   strengthening of the IOD-AR relationship is responsible for the
   weakening of SO-AR and vice-versa, especially during the post-1970
   period. It is evident that the strengthening of SO-IOD relationship
   results in good rainfall over India, as it shows a significant positive
   relationship and explains about 6 to 38\% variations in regional and
   All-India annual rainfall.},

Title = {Trends and Variabilities of Different Rainfall Intensities Over the West
   Coast and Central India and Their Association with Global SSTs},
Journal = {PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 30},
Abstract = {In this study, characteristics of summer monsoon rainfall (SMR) are
   investigated for two regions, West Coast (WC) and Central India (CI), in
   the Indian subcontinent during 1901-2020. We classified rain events into
   different intensity bins, viz. dry, low, moderate, high, very high and
   extreme. SMR in CI exhibits a significant decreasing trend of -5.6 mm
   season(-1) decade(-1). Similarly, a significant increasing trend in low
   and decreasing trend in very high intensity bins are noticed. In WC, the
   extreme intensity bin shows a significant increasing trend. From the
   coherence analysis of intensity bins between WC and CI, it is found that
   the correlation of rain events increased during 1991-2020, especially in
   extreme intensity bins. Analysis of the relationship of SMR with global
   sea surface temperature (SST) was carried out. The relationship of
   WC-rainfall with the Arabian Sea (AS) and the Bay of Bengal (BoB) SST
   shows significant changes from 1950. The correlation was previously
   positive but became negative after 1950. CI-rainfall shows a significant
   positive correlation with the southwest Pacific Ocean (SWPO) SST before
   1960, and thereafter it became negative. Extreme intensity bin
   correlation with the Nino 3 index has changed from 1960 in both WC and
   CI regions. When the SST variations in various ocean domains are
   examined, it is discovered that the SST is increasing significantly in
   the AS, BoB, north central Pacific Ocean (NCPO), Nino 3, SWPO, and north
   Atlantic Ocean (NAO). In general, recent changes in rainfall and
   rainfall-SST relationship clearly indicate the climate shift.},

Abstract = {In this study, we present the long-term daily and subdaily station data
   of annual extreme rainfall (1970-2015) and the trend analyses in
   rainfall regimes in Turkey. Trends in 5, 10, 15, and 30 min, 1, 2, 6,
   12, and 24 hr of extreme rainfall in seven different rainfall regimes
   are estimated through nonparametric tests. The trends in return levels
   (2, 20, and 100 years) are defined by an appropriate three-parameter
   generalized extreme value distribution and are evaluated in the
   climatological context of rainfall regimes. Overall, from 5-min to 2-hr
   durations, magnitudes of trends in extreme rainfall constantly increase
   in all rainfall regimes, which may be attributed to the intensified
   contribution of convective rainfall as a response to warming. Trend
   analysis of return levels reveals that, compared with 2-year return
   levels, low-probability high-impact extreme rainfall events generally
   have the lowest estimated median trends until 30-min to 2-hr range. A
   shift in the magnitudes of trends occurs generally at 30-min and 1-hr
   durations; trends of rare intense events increase at the expense of less
   intense extreme rainfall. Thus, the intensification of 1-2-hr extreme
   rainfall events can arise from both the increasing trends of more common
   events in shorter rainfall durations and from the increase in the trends
   of low-probability high-impact extreme rainfall events at this range.
   Moreover, explicitly in continental rainfall regimes, increases in the
   magnitudes of the trends in 30-min to 2-hr duration range are
   accompanied by various declines in 6-24-hr duration range. Although
   coastal regimes generally have increasing trend values from 5-min to
   24-hr durations, in northern and southern clusters, changes occur in the
   variability of extreme rainfall and the trend values of rarer (20- and
   100-year return periods) extreme rainfall exhibit increases in 6-12-hr
   range.},

Abstract = {Due to its deleterious and large-scale effects on the ecosystem and
   long-range transboundary nature, acid rain has attracted the attention
   of scientists and policymakers. Acid rain (AR) is a prominent
   environmental issue that has emerged in the last hundred years. AR
   refers to any form of precipitation leading to a reduction in pH to less
   than 5.6. The prime reasons for AR formation encompass the occurrence of
   sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O-3), and organic
   acids in air produced by natural as well as anthropogenic activities.
   India, the top SO2 emitter, also shows a continuous increase in NO2
   level responsible for AR formation. The plants being immobile
   unavoidably get exposed to AR which impacts the natural surrounding
   negatively. Plants get affected directly by AR due to reductions in
   growth, productivity, and yield by damaging photosynthetic mechanisms
   and reproductive organs or indirectly by affecting underground
   components such as soil and root system. Genes that play important role
   in plant defense under abiotic stress gets also modulated in response to
   acid rain. AR induces soil acidification, and disturbs the balance of
   carbon and nitrogen metabolism, litter properties, and microbial and
   enzymatic activities. This article overviews the factors contributing to
   AR, and outlines the past and present trends of rainwater pH across the
   world, and its effects on plants and soil systems.},

Abstract = {The North-Western Indian Himalayan Region (NW-IHR) is the source of some
   of India's major rivers and hosts a few of the highest mountain peaks in
   the world. The region is also a major source of water for the population
   living in the plains. We study the rainfall trends, magnitudes, and
   seasonal and annual variations in the NW-IHR during the last 120 years
   (1901-2020). The temporal trends in rainfall are estimated using the
   Mann-Kendall Test (MKT) and Modified Mann-Kendall Test (MMKT) at 10\%,
   5\%, and 1\% significance levels. The ACC at lag-1 was calculated and
   tested at 5\% significance level for the MMKT. The magnitude of the
   seasonal and annual rainfall was calculated using Sen's Slope (SS),
   Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA), and
   Spearman's Rho (SR). The variability of seasonal and annual rainfalls
   was studied using the Coefficient of Variation (CV). The results of our
   analysis revealed both increasing and decreasing trends at various
   levels of significance during seasonal and annual rainfalls. The
   majority of the districts in the northern region showed increasing
   trends, while the districts in the southern region showed decreasing
   trends. CV was higher for seasonal rainfalls as compared to annual
   rainfalls. Our analysis of trends and variability will help the local
   stakeholders for efficient planning and understand the risk and
   vulnerability of the region at large.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can greatly affect the snow process and cause
   severe snowmelt-related hazards. It is important to monitor the
   spatiotemporal distribution of ROS events over the ungauged High
   Mountain Asia (HMA). This study investigated the spatiotemporal
   variability of ROS events over the HMA and its potential influencing
   factors from 1981 to 2020 based on stand-alone Noah-MP land surface
   model simulations forced by hourly HARv2 reanalysis dataset. The results
   demonstrated that ROS activity occurred more frequently in the
   higher-elevation (2500-4000 m and 5500-6000 m a.s.l) regions of the
   Tianshan Mountains, Pamir, eastern Hindu Kush, Himalayas, and the
   western Hengduan Shan, with an annual maximum ROS frequency exceeding 15
   days and a maximum intensity reaching 40 mm concentrated in spring and
   summer. ROS frequency expe-rienced a significant decrease in the
   high-elevation (3000-4500 m a.s.l) regions of the eastern Hindu Kush,
   West Himalaya, and western Hengduan Shan with a rate exceeding-1.5
   days/decade. The decrease in ROS frequency could be explained by a
   shifting of precipitation type from snowfall to rain driven by dramatic
   warming and resulting in a decline in snowfall and shortened snow cover
   persistence, particularly in spring and summer. On the contrary,
   significantly increasing trend mainly prevailed in the high-elevation
   (5000-6000 m a.s.l) regions of Transhimalaya and East Himalaya,
   exceeding 0.9 days/decade. The attribution of the increased ROS
   frequency was related to the significant increase in summer
   precipitation over the Inner Tibetan Plateau, along with an absolute
   increase in snowfall, which was beneficial to snow accumulation with
   frequent transition of the pre-cipitation phase. The above outcomes
   improve our understanding of ROS events and highlight the importance of
   ROS in extreme snowmelt events and water resources management under a
   warming climate.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the temporal and spatial patterns of annual,
   seasonal, and monthly rainfall series during the period of 1961-2018 at
   15 stations in the agriculturally important Sebou river basin, northern
   Morocco. Trends were investigated using the classical non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test and the Theil-Sen approach at 90\%, 95\% and 99\%
   confidence levels. A general decreasing trend was found at the annual
   scale, significant at the 95\% confidence level at 8 stations out of 15
   (53\%). A particularly large decreasing trend between -30 mm and -50 mm
   per decade was found in the north and eastern parts of the basin. Autumn
   rainfall tended to increase, but this was not statistically significant.
   During the winter months, rainfall tended to decrease sharply (-27 mm
   and -40 mm per decade) in the northern slopes of the Rif mountains,
   while in spring, the mountainous area of the basin recorded decreases
   ranging between -12 mm and -16 mm per decade. During winter and spring,
   negative trends were significant at ten stations (66\%). Summer rainfall
   tends toward a decrease, but the absolute change is small. These results
   help to understand the rainfall variability in the Sebou river basin and
   allow for improved mitigation strategies and water resource plans based
   on a prospective view of the impact of climate change on the river
   basin.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is critical to agricultural and drinking water supply in the
   Thamirabharani river basin. The upper catchment areas of the
   Thamirabharani basin are located in high-elevated forest regions, and
   rainfall variability affects dam inflow and outflow. The well-known
   methods for rainfall analysis such as the coefficient of variation (CV),
   the precipitation concentration index (PCI), and trend analysis by
   Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope test, as well as the Sen's graphical
   innovative trend method (ITA) recently reported in several studies, were
   used. Rainfall data from gauge stations and the satellite-gridded
   Multisource Weighted Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) dataset were chosen
   for analysis at the annual and four-season time scales, namely, the
   Southwest Monsoon, Northeast Monsoon, winter, and summer seasons from
   1991 to 2020. The mean annual PCI value reflects irregular monthly
   rainfall distribution (PCI > 20) in all gauge stations. The spatial
   monthly rainfall distribution of PCI values remarkedly shows a moderate
   distribution in the western and an anomalous distribution in the eastern
   part of the basin. The annual mean rainfall ranges from 718.4 to 2268.6
   mm/year, decreasing from the high altitude zone in the west to the low
   plains and coastal regions in the east. Seasonal rainfall contributes
   about 42\% from the NEM, 30.6\% from the SWM, 22.8\% from summer, and
   3.9\% from winter, with moderate variability (CV less than 30\%). Ground
   stations experienced extremely high interannual variability in rainfall
   (more than 60\%). Trend analysis by the MK, TFPW-MK, and ITA methods
   shows increasing annual rainfall in the plains and coastal regions of
   the basin; particularly, more variations among the seasons were observed
   in the Lower Thamirabharani sub-basin. The NEM and summer season
   rainfall are statistically significant and contribute to the increasing
   trend in annual rainfall. The ITA method performed better in the annual
   and seasonal scale for detecting the rainfall trend than the MK and
   TFPW-MK test. The Lower Thamirabharani sub-basin in the eastern part of
   the basin receives more rain during the NEM than in other areas. To
   summarize, the low plains in the central and coastal regions in the
   southeast part experience an increase in rainfall with irregular monthly
   distribution. This study helps farmers, governments, and policymakers in
   effective agricultural crop planning and water management.},

Abstract = {The amount and annual distribution of rainfall caused a major
   socioeconomic and environmental problem where rainfed agriculture is
   predominant. This study assessed the long-term variability and trends of
   rainfall in the Wabi Shebele River Basin (WSRB), Ethiopia. The basin was
   discretized into 9 local agroclimatic zones (ACZ) based on annual
   rainfall and elevation. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to
   check the variability of rainfall while modified Mann-Kendall (MK) and
   Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) methods were used to detect rainfall
   trends. For each ACZ, stations with long-term records and less than 10\%
   of missing data were selected for further analysis. The mean annual
   rainfall in the basin ranges from 227.2 mm to 1047.4 mm. The study
   revealed most of the ACZs showed a very high variation in Belg/Spring
   rainfall (CV\% > 30) than Kiremt/Summer and annual rainfall. Seasonal
   and annual rainfall trend analysis revealed that no uniform trend was
   detected in all ACZs. However, most of ACZs in the arid and semi-arid
   areas showed a non-significant decreasing trend in annual rainfall. From
   seasonal analysis, Belg and Kiremt rainfall showed relatively decreasing
   and increasing trends respectively. In comparison, a similar result was
   observed using MK and ITA methods.},

Abstract = {This paper is a cross-comparative examination of how tropical forested
   islands were populated by humans. It first describes the unique
   ecological conditions of these environments, how they fluctuated during
   glacial cycles, and the challenges and affordances they provided people.
   The paper then explores the global archaeological record, classifying
   modes of colonisation that led insular tropical forests to be populated.
   These modes include terrestrial colonisation followed by insularisation
   (Mode A), maritime colonisation followed by major landmass
   reconfiguration (Mode B), maritime colonisation of uninhabited islands
   that always remained insular (Mode C), and maritime colonisation of
   already inhabited islands (Mode D). Finally, the paper discusses how,
   amongst Homo sapiens, ongoing dynamism between human adaptive behaviours
   and environmental flux stimulated processes of diversification,
   specialisation, and connectivity in these crucial ecologies; by
   contrast, archaic hominins like Homo erectus, Homo floresiensis, and
   Homo luzonensis may have found changes associated with forest expansion
   and insularity extremely challenging.},

Abstract = {This study aims to assess patterns, variability, and trends of rainfall

   using 42-year monthly TerraClimate gridded precipitation data at 23
   sites distributed to cover the entire Congo River Basin. The spatial
   distribution of seasonal rainfall and the Koppen climate classifications
   indicated that the Congo River Basin has three main climatic zones.
   Where the highest rainfall is received in zone A (north of 2.5 degrees
   N) during June-August (JJA), in zone B (3.5 degrees S-2.5 degrees N)
   during March-May (MAM) and September-November (SON), and in zone C
   (south of 3.5 degrees S) during December-February (DJF). The
   Mann-Kendall (M-K) trend analysis of seasonal and annual patterns of
   rainfall and standardized precipitation drought index (SPI) revealed
   that there were significant negative trends in most of the three
   climatic Congo zones except for slight positive trends in small parts
   within zone C, especially during JJA, which are found sometimes in zone
   B. Finally, the three Congo climatic zones are characterized by negative
   trends for seasonal and annual data of both rainfall and the SPI,
   indicating increased drought risks in the Congo Basin except for small
   parts in zone C which have positive (wet) trends, especially during JJA
   followed by DJF.},

Abstract = {Rainfall behavior is a fundamental issue in areas with scarce and

   rainy precipitation series in the period 1950-2020. Three of these

   their accumulated volumes. We then characterized the mean synoptic
   causes of the 10 most intense events in each component at both mean
   sea-level pressure and 500 hPa geopotential height, and also the
   integrated water-vapor transport between 1,000 and 300 hPa. We found a
   clear spatial distribution of the pluviometric effects related to
   unstable atmospheric situations (such as troughs and cut-off lows), and
   also to SW-SE advection fluxes that brought moist air from the Western
   Mediterranean. In particular, torrential rainfall in the Balearic
   Islands related more to E-NE advections than to southeastern ones. We
   also determined that the major parts of these components occurred in
   early autumn, especially in September and October. We expect these
   findings to help our understanding of the processes leading to
   catastrophic situations along the Spanish Mediterranean coast and to
   lead to improvements in early alert systems and management plans.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Variability, Trends, and Potential Impacts of Extreme
   Rainfall Events in the Sudano-Sahelian Region of Cameroon},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The Sudano-Sahelian region of Cameroon is mainly drained by the Benue,
   Chari, and Logone rivers; which are very useful for water resources;
   especially for irrigation, hydropower generation, and navigation.
   Long-term changes in mean and extreme rainfall events in the region may
   be of crucial importance in understanding the impacts of climate change.
   Daily and monthly rainfall data from fifteen climate stations in the
   study area from 1980 to 2018 and measurements from the Expert Team on
   Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) were estimated using the
   non-parametric innovative trend analysis (ITA) and the Sen slope
   estimator. The precipitation concentration index (PCI), the
   precipitation concentration degree (PCD), and the precipitation
   concentration period (PCP) were used to explore the spatiotemporal
   variations in the characteristics of rainfall concentrations. The
   results showed complex spatial patterns of the annual average PCI values
   across the Sudano-Sahelian region; which varied from values lower in the
   south to higher in the far north, which were the characteristic of
   seasonality and a strong seasonal precipitation distribution throughout
   the year; respectively. The PCD results revealed that the annual rainy
   days in a year decreased from the south to the far north. Additionally,
   the PCP results indicated a slightly later occurrence of precipitation.
   A significant trend toward more intense-extreme rainfall events was
   observed in most parts of the study area, but a significant trend toward
   more humid days was observed in the southeastern part. Trends in dry
   days significantly increased in the central and southwestern parts of
   the study area. This could mean that the prevalence of flood and drought
   risks are higher in the study area. Overall, the increase in annual
   rainfall could benefit the hydro-power sector, agricultural irrigation,
   the availability of potable water sources, and food security.},

Title = {Identification of homogenous rainfall regions with trend analysis using
   fuzzy logic and clustering approach coupled with advanced trend analysis
   techniques in Mumbai city},
Journal = {URBAN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Climatic conditions are significantly changing in the urban areas in the
   age of climate change. However, due the dynamic nature of urban areas
   and uneven distribution of meteorological stations, it is difficult to
   study rainfall pattern in the urban areas. Hence, in this study, trend
   and pattern of rainfall have been examined of Mumbai city using rainfall
   regionalization approach. For this, K-means and fuzzy C-means (FCM)
   clustering approaches have been used to examine the pattern of rainfall.
   The innovative trend analysis (ITA) and five tests of Mann-Kendall (MK)
   family have been utilized for anaylzing the rainfall trend. Result shows
   that both K-means and FCM techniques have identified two homogeneous
   rainfall regions in Mumbai exhibiting two distinctive rainfall patterns.
   The ITA curve shows that in the lower cluster, the data points are below
   1:1 (45o) line, but in high and moderate cluster, they are above the
   line. This shows that there is a positive trend in the rainfall, but it
   is not monotonic. Further, the MK tests utilized in this study also
   shows positive trend in the rainfall in Mumbai. The result of this study
   may help in management of water resource and in urban flood mitigation
   in Mumbai city.},

Title = {Analysis of extreme rainfall trend and mapping of the Wadi pluvial flood
   in the Gaza coastal plain of Palestine},
Journal = {ACTA GEOPHYSICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {2135-2147},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the eastern Mediterranean region of the Middle East and North Africa,
   pluvial flooding has become a common and severe climate change
   consequence event that requires immediate attention. The Wadi-Gaza basin
   is a critical source of surface water in Palestine; nevertheless,
   climate change and anthropogenic processes are altering the basin's
   hydrological features, resulting in a series of extreme and disastrous
   flooding events in the coastal plain at the basin downstream. The
   Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, and the IPTA method that was
   used to analyze historical rainfall in the basin from 1979 to 2013 refer
   to a declining trend pattern, which reduces the surge of runoff
   discharge. Moreover, the future projection for the total monthly
   rainfall under the ensemble model of CIMP5 for the RCP scenarios of
   2.60, 4.50, and 8.50 demonstrate a general decreasing trend in the
   rainfall with a variation ranging between about - 36 and - 53\%. The
   frequency analysis for the maximum daily rainfall using different
   computing approaches shows that the theoretical maximum rainfall values
   for the assessment of flooding events were assigned to 22, 31, 35, 45
   52, 59, 66, and 77 mm for the whole basin for the return periods (T) of
   2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 years, respectively. The land
   cover-land use of the basin shows that 51\% is barren land while the
   other portion is divided between urban (similar to 16\%), agricultural
   (similar to 13\%), and natural (similar to 20\%) lands. However, the
   type of soil that covers the basin is classified mainly as clay, loam,
   and sandy clay. According to the hydraulic analysis of downstream
   flooding, the volume of surge water that might reach the coastal plain
   in the event of water storms of 22 and 77 mm is around 6 and 118 million
   cubic meters, respectively. The area at risk of inundation due to floods
   in the Wadi-Gaza is between 3 and 17 km(2), covering around 5-29 percent
   of the Gaza Strip's middle governorate area, respectively.},

Title = {Drivers of rainfall trends in and around Mainland Southeast Asia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Observational rain gauge/satellite and reanalysis datasets since the
   1950s are evaluated for trends in mean and extreme rainfall in and
   around Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA). Rain gauge data indicate strong
   increases exceeding 50\% in both annual mean precipitation and various
   extreme precipitation indices over Vietnam and the northwestern part of
   the peninsula since 1979. The remote influence of ENSO may partially
   explain the recent precipitation trend toward a more intense regional
   hydrological cycle, in response to predominant La Nina states over
   recent decades. Increasing precipitation in MSEA is also associated with
   increased monsoon intensity in southeast Asia and a northward shift of
   the monsoon activity center toward MSEA over 1979-2018. Warming-driven
   evaporation increases were obtained over the adjacent seas typically
   feeding precipitation over MSEA associated with a shift toward
   predominantly positive phases of the two major natural climate
   variability modes of the tropical Indian Ocean, namely the Indian Ocean
   Dipole and the Indian Ocean Basin Mode. A moisture budget analysis using
   ERA5 re-analysis data showed increasing oceanic moisture transports
   along the typical winter and summer moisture pathways toward the MSEA.
   However, results show that during summer the major part of increased
   moisture from the oceanic moisture sources ends up as precipitation over
   the oceanic regions adjacent to MSEA with ERA5 not being able to produce
   the observed positive trends in summer continental precipitation. On the
   other hand, ERA5 reveals pronounced increases in winter precipitation
   over the MSEA, in accordance with rain-gauge data, associated with
   strongly increasing transport of moisture originated from the western
   tropical Pacific and the South China Sea.},

Title = {Modeling and predicting rainfall time series using seasonal-trend
   decomposition and machine learning},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {251},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {This study presents a hybrid approach that integrates seasonal-trend
   decomposition and machine learning (termed STL-ML) for predicting the
   rainfall time series one step ahead based on the historical rainfall and
   other meteorological (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) data. The
   proposed hybrid STL-ML approach mainly consists of three steps: (1) The
   seasonal-trend decomposition is used to firstly decompose the rainfall
   time series into the trend, seasonal, and remainder components; (2)
   Three different machine learning (ML) models, namely Gated Recurrent
   Unit (GRU) network, multi-time-scale GRU network, and Light Gradient
   Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model, are developed for modeling and
   predicting the three components, respectively; (3) The predicted
   rainfall is eventually acquired by adding up the predicted values of the
   three components, and several metrics are used to evaluate the model
   performance. To verify the applicability and validity of the proposed
   approach, a case study is conducted on the daily meteorology data
   collected in Cairns, Australia, from 1st Jan 2000 to 31st Dec 2020. The
   case study results imply that: (1) Through the seasonal-trend
   decomposition of the rainfall time series, various patterns and
   information beneath the rainfall time series can be fully extracted and
   explicitly demonstrated in its three components, which is beneficial to
   an accurate rainfall prediction. (2) The GRU network, multi-time-scale
   GRU network, and LightGBM model can well fit and predict the trend,
   seasonal, and remainder components, respectively. (3) By adding up the
   predicted values of the three components, the predicted rainfall shows
   satisfactory agreement with the ground truth, and a reliable
   one-step-ahead prediction can be achieved even if an sudden extreme
   rainfall occurs. (4) The comparisons with three baseline methods further
   justify the rationality and effectiveness of the hybrid STL-ML approach.
   The novelty of the proposed STL-ML approach lies in its capabilities of
   (1) fully extracting and utilizing the information in every regard to
   predict rainfall; (2) providing a good one-step-ahead rainfall
   estimation for sudden heavy rainfall events. Therefore, it can be used
   as an essential complement to numerical rainfall prediction and thus can
   play a crucial role in flood prediction and hydrological disaster
   control. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Recent Trends and Economic Aspects in the Rainbow Trout (<i>Oncorhynchus

Abstract = {In recent decades, the global aquaculture sector has become more complex
   and dynamic due to several factors, such as strong demand at the retail
   level, diversification of farmed species, outsourcing of product
   processing, and synergies among producers, processors, and retailers.
   Globally, the fish food sector has become very important to meet the
   growing human demand for food. In 2020, 89\% of fish production was used
   for direct human consumption (17\% of the total protein consumed).
   Global fish consumption has increased (excluding algae) at an annual
   rate of 3\% since 1960. In 2030, the total fish production is expected
   to reach 202 million tons (MT) and the aquaculture production 106 MT.
   The United Nations has estimated that, between now and 2030, the global
   demand for fish products will increase by at least 40 MT each year. This
   need cannot be satisfied by fishing alone, given that fishing practices
   have reached an intensity that is unsustainable, and that climate change
   and pollution are worsening the problems of marine ecosystems. European
   and Italian aquaculture is characterised by a diversification scenario
   in terms of production systems, technologies adopted, and species bred.
   According to an EU report, Italian aquaculture production has grown by
   4\% in the last five years (fourth place in Europe). In Italy, rainbow
   trout is the most widely farmed species. The production of rainbow trout
   contributes approximately 25.5\% of the total value and 69.9\% of the
   volume of farmed fish. Over the past ten years, trout production has
   increased by 8.5\% overall with an average annual growth rate of 2.5\%.
   The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the economic
   situation of the rainbow trout production and consumption sectors in
   Italy using a supply chain approach. In particular, in this brief
   excursus, the main production trends and the economic and organisational
   relationships between the various companies and associations in the
   aquaculture sector are analysed.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the Innovative Trend Methodology (ITM) and their inspired
   approaches, i.e., Double (D-ITM) and Triple (T-ITM), were combined with
   Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) time frequency-based method. The new
   hybrid methods (i.e., ITM-HHT, D-ITM-HHT, and T-ITM-HHT) were proposed
   and compared to the DWT-based methods in order to recommend the best
   method. Three total annual rainfall time series from 1920 to 2011 were
   selected from three hydrological basins in Northern Algeria. The new
   combined models (ITM-HHT, D-ITM-HHT, and T-ITM-HHT) revealed that the
   1950-1975 period has significant wet episodes followed by a long-term
   drought observed in the western region of Northern Algeria, while
   Northeastern Algeria presented a wet period since 2001. The proposed
   approaches successfully detected, in a visible manner, hidden trends
   presented in the signals, which proves that the removal of some modes of
   variability from the original rainfall signals can increase the accuracy
   of the used approaches.},

Abstract = {Analysis of rainfall distribution and its changing pattern plays a vital
   role in managing water resources in a region. This work examined the
   spatio-temporal variability and trend of rainfall on yearly and
   season-wise scales during 1971-2013 in the Wainganga river basin
   situated in middle India. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test was implemented for
   identifying the temporal variation in rainfall trends. The magnitude of
   this changing trend was estimated by applying Sen's slope (SS) method. A
   paired sample t-test was also employed to appraise the statistical
   significance of changes in rainfall data. The results of MK and SS tests
   show both upward and downward trends. The results show positive and
   negative trends in the south-eastern and northwestern parts of the study
   area for annual rainfall. The monsoon rainfall also shows very close
   proximity with annual rainfall data trends. The t-test states that the
   observed changes in precipitation are statistically significant. After
   trend and pattern analysis, state-space models (SSMs) were used to
   predict rainfall for future scenarios. Four SSMs (single, double, and
   triple exponential, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA))
   were employed for rainfall prediction. The analysis shows that the ARIMA
   is best for rainfall prediction with architecture of (0,0,0) (2,1,0) and
   can be used in Wainganga River basin.},

Abstract = {Long-term rainfall trends analysis under climate change, particularly in
   developing countries where rainfed agriculture is substantial, is
   vigorous to evaluate rainfall variability brought changes and propose
   possible adaptation measures. Hence, the study was designed to evaluate
   annual and seasonal long-term trends in rainfall in Wabe Shebele River
   Basin in Ethiopia using gridded monthly precipitation data derived from
   Climate Research Unit (CRU TS 4.1) with 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees
   resolution from 1920 to 2019 years. The time series trend of annual and
   seasonal rainfall was detected by employing innovative trend analysis
   (ITA). The results were compared with the most widely used Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator method. The basin was sub-divided
   into ten sub-basins for easy analysis. The MK test result revealed a
   non-significant decrease in annual and seasonal rainfall trends that
   occurred in most sub-basins and the entire basin. The results of the ITA
   method showed that the scattered plot was accumulated on the 1:1 (45
   degrees) straight line, indicating no trend for most of the sub-basins.
   The trends vary within sub-basins and rainfall magnitude while the
   decreasing and increasing trends were within +/- 10\%. The finding
   indicates that statistics for phi are non-uniform spatial and temporal
   and show no significant trends at a 5\% significant level in the most
   sub-basins. The comparison of the three selected methods indicates that
   ITA performs better in trend investigation. Hence, the ITA method
   provides results in graphical form, which makes a straightforward
   interpretation of trends based on rainfall intensity. Rainfall trends
   investigation is vital for agricultural development where combining the
   possible adaptation measures to climate change is vigorous during water
   resources planning and development for agriculture. Accordingly, the
   strategic plan is recommended for the practical activity of agriculture
   by considering the decline and variability of rainfall patterns in the
   sub-basins particularly and in the basin generally.},

Abstract = {In the era of global urbanization, the cities across the world are
   experiencing significant change in the climate pattern. However,
   analysing the trend and pattern of rainfall over the urban areas has a
   number of challenges such as availability of long-term data as well as
   the uneven distribution of rain-gauge stations. In this research, the
   rainfall regionalization approach has been applied along with the
   advanced statistical techniques for analysing the trend and pattern of
   rainfall in the Delhi metropolitan city. Fuzzy C-means and K-means
   clustering techniques have been applied for the identification of
   homogeneous rainfall regions while innovative trend analysis (ITA) along
   with the family of Mann-Kendall (MK) tests has been applied for the
   trend analysis of rainfall. The result shows that in all rain-gauge
   stations of Delhi, an increasing trend in rainfall has been recorded
   during 1991-2018. But the rate of increase was low as the trend slope of
   ITA and Sen's slope in MK tests are low, which varies between 0.03 and
   0.05 and 0.01 and 0.16, respectively. Furthermore, none of the
   rain-gauge stations have experienced a monotonic trend in rainfall as
   the null hypothesis has not been rejected (p value > 0.05) for any
   stations. Furthermore, the study shows that ITA has a better performance
   than the family of MK tests. The findings of this study may be utilized
   for the urban flood mitigation and solving other issues related to water
   resources in Delhi and other cities.},

Abstract = {Sub-daily rainfall datasets are not commonly available in developing
   countries, but the annual maximum daily rainfall (P-ma) often is. This
   article evaluates the ratio between 1440 min of rainfall and the P-ma,
   as well as the sub-daily rainfall ratio from different origins as
   disaggregation coefficients for modeling the
   intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves in the metropolitan area of
   Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Non-parametric tests were previously applied to
   the series to verify stationarity, homogeneity, randomness, and
   independence. It was verified via Student's t-test and identity test
   models that there is a significant difference between the IDF curves
   from the sub-daily rainfall dataset and disaggregation rainfall dataset.
   Nevertheless, the model performance indexes between the results of IDF
   curves indicate the errors are acceptable, thus guaranteeing an
   alternative tool in places where there are no sub-daily rainfall
   datasets available. Sub-daily rainfall ratios can be used as
   disaggregation coefficients on a local and regional scale.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze the temporal tendencies of monthly,
   seasonal, and annual rainfall and runoff in the Wadi Mina basin
   (north-western side of Africa) using data from five stations in the
   period from 1973-2012. With this aim, first, a trend analysis was
   performed using two non-parametric tests: the Theil-Sen estimator and
   the Mann-Kendall test. Then, to identify trends in the different
   rainfall and runoff values of the series, the Innovative Trend Analysis
   technique was further applied. The results of the application of the
   non-parametric tests on the rainfall data showed a general negative
   rainfall trend in the Wadi Mina basin for different timescales.
   Similarly, the results evidenced a general reduction in the runoff
   values, in particular in the Sidi Abdelkader Djillali and Oued Abtal
   stations, even though the results obtained for the Oued Abtal station
   are influenced by a dam. These results were further analyzed through
   Sen's method, which enabled the trend identification of the different
   values (low, medium, and high) of the series.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the spatio-temporal distribution and trends of
   seasonal rainfall for different meteorological sub-divisions (MSDs) of
   India using statistical analysis and the innovative trend analysis (ITA)
   method. The gridded dataset of daily rainfall for 120 years from 1901 to
   2020 was obtained from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and
   analysed using statistical results of mean rainfall, standard deviation,
   coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis, maximum seasonal rainfall,
   percent deviation of rainfall, number of rainy days, rainfall intensity,
   rainfall categorization, trend detection, and cross-correlation
   coefficients. The period was divided into three quad-decadal times (QDT)
   of 40 years each (i.e., 1901-1940: QDT1, 1941-1980: QDT2, and 1981-2020:
   QDT3). A general decrease in the number of rainfall events was observed
   in all the seasons except for a few MSDs of northwest India showing a
   rise throughout the pre-monsoon season in recent times (QDT3).
   Significant trends were detected using the ITA method in seasonal
   rainfall in nearly all the MSDs of India. Our findings are highlighting
   the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of seasonal rainfall
   dynamics at the MSDs level which will be useful for comprehending the
   rainfall dynamics as impacted by climate change and climate variability
   in India, and may further lead the policymakers and stakeholders for
   making the best use of available water resources.},

Title = {Centennial Annual Rainfall Pattern Changes Show an Increasing Trend with

Abstract = {Global warming and anthropogenic activities have imposed noticeable
   impacts on rainfall pattern changes at both spatial and temporal scales
   in recent decades. Systematic diagnosis of rainfall pattern changes is
   urgently needed at spatiotemporal scales for a deeper understanding of
   how climate change produces variations in rainfall patterns. The
   objective of this study was to identify rainfall pattern changes
   systematically under climate change at a subcontinental scale along a
   rainfall gradient ranging from 1800 to 200 mm yr(-1) by analyzing
   centennial rainfall data covering 230 sites from 1910 to 2017 in the
   Northern Territory of Australia. Rainfall pattern changes were
   characterized by considering aspects of trends and periodicity of annual
   rainfall, abrupt changes, rainfall distribution, and extreme rainfall
   events. Our results illustrated that rainfall patterns in northern
   Australia have changed significantly compared with the early period of
   the twentieth century. Specifically, 1) a significant increasing trend
   in annual precipitation associated with greater variation in recent
   decades was observed over the entire study area, 2) temporal variations
   represented a mean rainfall periodicity of 27 years over wet to dry
   regions, 3) an abrupt change of annual rainfall amount occurred
   consistently in both humid and arid regions during the 1966-75 period,
   and 4) partitioned long-term time series of rainfall demonstrated a
   wetter rainfall distribution trend across coastal to inland areas that
   was associated with more frequent extreme rainfall events in recent
   decades. The findings of this study could facilitate further studies on
   the mechanisms of climate change that influence rainfall pattern
   changes. Significance StatementCharacterizing long-term rainfall pattern
   changes under different rainfall conditions is important to understand
   the impacts of climate change. We conducted diagnosis of centennial
   rainfall pattern changes across wet to dry regions in northern Australia
   and found that rainfall patterns have noticeably changed in recent
   decades. The entire region has a consistent increasing trend of annual
   rainfall with higher variation. Meanwhile, the main shifting period of
   rainfall pattern was during 1966-75. Although annual rainfall seems to
   become wetter with an increasing trend, more frequent extreme rainfall
   events should also be noticed for assessing the impacts of climate
   changes. The findings support further study to understand long-term
   rainfall pattern changes under climate change.},

Title = {Regional Trends and Spatiotemporal Analysis of Rainfall and Groundwater

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The present study investigates the spatiotemporal variabilities of
   long-term (1950-2016) rainfall and regional groundwater levels for
   annual and seasonal periods over the west coast of India. The study area
   is a narrow strip of land between Western Ghats (mountainous terrain)
   and the Arabian Sea, extending over 1,500 km from south to north. The
   Mann Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope estimator established the long-term
   trend and magnitude of rainfall and groundwater. The nature of trends in
   the time series of hydroclimatic variables was identified through
   singular spectrum analysis (SSA). The SSA extracted nonlinear trends
   along with the shape for both increasing and decreasing trends. Annual
   and southwest monsoon rainfall exhibited prominent decreasing trends.
   The percentage departure analysis of rainfall revealed that earlier
   decades (1950-1980) were the wettest, followed by the drier decades
   (1980-2016) for Periyar, Varrar, and Netravati and vice versa for
   Vasishti and Bhatsol. The wavelet spectra for rainfall indicated short-
   and long-term modulations. The long-term groundwater level trends of 725
   wells on the entire west coast showed a significant decline in 13\% of
   wells, and 6\% of wells indicated increasing trends. The Monte
   Carlo-based numerical investigations on the modified MK (mMK) test power
   indicated the influence of parent distributions on trend detection. The
   field significance of trends at a 5\% significance level was examined
   using the bootstrap test. The precipitation data were then compared with
   groundwater level variation at each site, and correlations were
   established. The declining southwest monsoon rains and their uneven
   spatial distribution could be attributed to a subsequent decline in the
   region's postmonsoon groundwater levels.},

Abstract = {This paper has examined the variability and trends of rainfall in the
   Borana zone, southern Ethiopia. Monthly rainfall data from 1981 to 2018
   were obtained from the National Meteorological Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia.
   Mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation were employed to
   analyze temporal variability. Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope
   estimator (SEE) were used to determine trend and its magnitude,
   respectively. The inverse weighting distance (IDW) interpolation
   technique was employed to generate surface data and produce spatial
   rainfall maps. April and Belg were the wettest month and season,
   respectively. On an annual basis, Arero (741 mm) followed by Teltele
   (629 mm) were the wettest stations, whereas the Dillo station (285 mm)
   was the driest. Rainfall is highly variable on a monthly and seasonal
   basis than annual timescale. Meher rainfall has shown a significant
   rainfall increase (P-value <0.05) at most stations. A significant
   increase in annual rainfall was observed at Arero, Dehas, Dillo and
   Miyo. Spatially, rainfall decreases from the northeast and northwest
   parts of the Borana towards the southwest. The findings of this study
   can serve as a reference basis and provides useful information for
   policymakers to devise and implement better water management strategies
   in this water-scarce region.},

Title = {Application of innovative trend analysis on rainfall time series over
   Rajsamand district of Rajasthan state},

Abstract = {Rainfall is an important part of the hydrological cycle, as well as its
   variability, and is relevant to drought and floods. Long-term changes in
   hydrological processes are referred to as climate change for an area.
   Urbanization, population growth, and economic growth are all having
   negative effects on the environment. The study of trends in the long
   term is essential from climatic change and socioeconomic perspectives.
   Examining the temporal variations in rainfall is crucial because changes
   in rainfall patterns and distribution can have a significant impact on
   the amount of water available in a watershed. The objective of the study
   is to assess the long-term (1902-2021) temporal trends in seasonal
   (winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon) and annual rainfall for
   the Rajsamand district of Rajasthan state using the innovative trend
   analysis (ITA) technique. Due to its ability to provide results in
   graphical form, the innovative trend analysis approach is a very useful
   tool for detecting patterns in rainfall time series data. This technique
   is also used to detect trends as `low,' `medium,' and `high,' which
   should be considered in future studies on floods `high' and drought
   `low', respectively. Based on the above study, it is observed that no
   trend is detected for the annual season, a positive trend is detected in
   the winter season and a Negative trend is detected for pre-monsoon and
   post-monsoon seasons in some regimes respectively. The ITA of the S-W
   monsoon also specifies that in the low regime the nature of the trend is
   increasing and in the high regime nature of the trend is decreasing.
   This research will serve as a scientific foundation for assessing and
   mitigating the effect of climate change on the environment in order to
   reduce the risk of weather patterns.},

Abstract = {With the frequent recurrence of hydroclimatic hazards, such as
   rainfall-induced floods and landslides, it is essential to look at the
   spatio-temporal evolution of rainfall trends and teleconnections of
   regional rainfall with global climatic indices. The present study is
   carried out in two climatologically contrasting terrains, the humid
   regions in the western side of South-Peninsular India (SPI-W) and
   semi-arid to arid regions in the eastern side of South-Peninsular India
   (SPI-E). Trends in the rainfall were studied over a long-term
   (1901-2020) gridded rainfall data, and change points were detected using
   the Pettitt's test. An expanding-sliding window trend analysis based on
   Kendall's Taub was carried out to decode the time evolution of rainfall
   trends and to differentiate consistent gradual monotonic trends from
   step changes. Two distinct change points were observed in the rainfall,
   the first in the 1960s and second in 1990s. SPI-E manifested a strong
   positive trend in the monsoon rainfall after 1990's while SPI-W
   demonstrated a weakening in rainfall after 1960's. The regionally
   diverse trends during the recent epochs are evaluated along with IOD
   (Indian Ocean Dipole) and it was observed that there is a significant
   increase in co-occurrence of positive rainfall anomaly, positive IOD and
   positive ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) events after 1990. Increase
   in positive IOD events could be associated with the changes in the
   regional rainfall during these recent epochs. The trends in monthly and
   annual rainfall showed high sensitivity to data periods and data
   lengths, highlighting the need to perform such comprehensive analysis
   for the planning of reservoir operations, water management and
   agricultural activities.},

Abstract = {Current global warming causes a change in atmospheric dynamics, with
   consequent variations in the rainfall regimes. Understanding the
   relationship between global climate patterns, global warming, and
   rainfall regimes is crucial for the creation of future scenarios and for
   the relative modification of water management. The aim of this study is
   to improve knowledge of the relationship between North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic (EA), and Western Mediterranean
   Oscillation (WeMO) with the seasonal rainfalls in Tuscany, Italy. The
   study area occupies a strategic position since it lies in a transition
   zone between the wet area of northern Europe and the dry area of the
   northern coast of Africa. This research, based on a statistical
   correlation method and on linear models, is designed to understand the
   relationship between seasonal rainfalls and climate patterns. The
   results of this study demonstrate that the use of linear models can
   yield more information than traditional statistical corre-lations. The
   results show a decrease in rainfall in the warm period of the year,
   namely in the summer, when its expression is most visible. This
   phenomenon is ascribable to current global warming, which causes an
   increase in sea-surface temperatures. An increase in the Northern
   Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature and in the Mediterra-nean Sea Surface
   Temperature causes a reduction of the Iceland Low, with an extension of
   the Azores High. Moreover, an increase in the Genoa Gulf SST induces a
   weakening of the Genoa Gulf Low, one of the main cyclogenetic systems of
   the Mediterranean.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to enlarge knowledge of space-time evolution
   of precipitation in California over the last decade on a monthly,
   seasonal and annual time-scale. This study also analyses the
   relationship between precipitation and teleconnection patterns with most
   influence on Californian climate. The homogeneity of the data from the
   selected stations was verified and finally 165 meteorological stations
   were used with an observation period that ranged from 1980 to 2019. In
   order to evaluate trends and statistical significance, both the
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and modified Sen's slope method were
   used. Correlation analysis using the partial non-parametric Spearman
   Test (95\% confidence level) was performed to find out relationships
   between precipitation and nine teleconnection patterns in the State of
   California. Spatial analysis was achieved using Empirical Bayesian
   Kriging (EBK). Finally, this research, as a novelty, shows
   regionalisation of California State as a function of significance in the
   correlation of precipitation with teleconnection patterns. To achieve
   this, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Hierarchical
   Cluster analysis (HCA) was performed. Results show a positive
   precipitation trend in winter and negative precipitation trend in late
   summer and autumn. The teleconnection patterns more correlated with
   precipitation are El Nin similar to o along Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
   Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Four
   areas were discerned outlining the Mojave Climate Region (Area 4) by
   having ENSO as the teleconnection pattern that best account
   precipitation.},

Title = {Farmers' perceptions of climate change, long-term variability and trends

Journal = {CABI AGRICULTURE \& BIOSCIENCE},

Abstract = {BackgroundClimate change poses severe threats to smallholder farmers'
   agricultural livelihoods and food security in Sub Saharan Africa.
   Understanding long-term rainfall trends of variability and extremes at
   local scales and perceptions regarding long-term changes in climate
   variables is important in planning appropriate adaptation measures to
   climate change. This paper examines the perception of farmers in Apac
   district regarding long-term changes in climate variables and analyzes
   the trend of occurrence in seasonal and annual rainfall in Apac
   district, northern Uganda. A cross-sectional survey design was employed
   to collect data on farmers' perceptions regarding long-term changes in
   climate from 260 randomly selected smallholder farmers' households
   across two sub-counties in Apac district by administering
   semi-structured questionnaires in February 2018. Monthly rainfall data
   sets from the Uganda Meteorological Authority (UMA) for the period 1980
   to 2019 for Apac district were also used to analyze trends of
   occurrences in seasonal and annual rainfall in the study area. The
   non-parametric Sequential Mann-Kendall (SMK) tests were employed at a
   5\% significance level to detect mean seasonal rainfall trends and
   abrupt change points.ResultsThe majority of the respondents (87\%)
   perceived a decrease in precipitation over the past 39 years. The plot
   of forward regression u(t(i)) values and backward regression u'(t(i))
   values showed interactions indicating rainfall trends, rainfall lower
   and upper limits and abrupt change points in the different cropping
   seasons. Analysis of historical series of mean monthly and annual
   rainfall showed an abrupt change in rainfall in March, April, May (MAM)
   season in 1982. Although the September, October and November (SON)
   season did not show a significant abrupt change, there was a significant
   (p < 0.05) increase in rainfall above the upper limit from 1994 to
   date.ConclusionThe mean seasonal rainfall for MAM and SON cropping
   seasons in Apac district were highly variable from different time points
   within the past 39 years (1980-2019), while June, July, and August (JJA)
   did not realize a significant change in rainfall within the same study
   period that the two cropping seasons (MAM and SON) in the district
   experienced remarkable variations in rainfall. This, therefore, provides
   a basis for the government to strengthen the provision of an effective
   climate tailored agricultural advisory service to aid farmers'
   adaptation planning at the local level and to assist smallholder farmers
   and land-use managers in developing effective adaptation management
   strategies to the effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {The traditional approach to characterize extreme rainfall events is
   based on using past observed data to fit a probability distribution,
   which is used to associate a certain probability of occurrence to a
   rainfall magnitude, under a stationary assumption. Observed series,
   however, may exhibit trends and abrupt changes, resulting from the
   natural hydro climatic variability and the climate change context, which
   are not usually considered in the stationary modelling procedure and
   which may affect the characterization of extreme events. In this paper,
   it was evaluated the presence of these temporal changes in rainfall
   series and their impact to estimate design quantiles, using rainfall
   data of 317 stations, located in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The results
   showed that extreme rainfall events are changing in the state.
   Low-return period events (up to 10 years) are intensifying. Moderate-
   and high-return period events, on the other hand, did not present a
   clear spatial pattern. Trends and abrupt changes may significantly
   influence the estimation of design quantiles. The presence of the former
   in rainfall series exhibited more influence on low-return period events,
   showing, however, no clear relationship with high-return period design
   quantiles. The presence of the latter seems to influence the
   characterization process, affecting estimated quantiles of all evaluated
   return periods. Such findings highlight the need to consider the
   presence of trends and abrupt changes and their influence on design
   quantiles for a more reliable characterization.},

Abstract = {A long and complete series of monthly rainfall amounts corresponding to
   Barcelona city (Catalonia, NE Spain), exceeding two centuries (years
   1786-2019), is analysed in detail. The obtained results of periodicity
   (annual scale), time trends (monthly, seasonal and annual scales),
   statistical distribution (seasonal and annual scale) and
   fractal/multifractal structures and self-similarity at monthly scale
   depict the complex structure of this pluviometric regime, which is
   characterized by moderate increasing and decreasing trends on rain
   amounts, varying from +0.08 mm center dot year(-1) (February) to -0.07
   mm center dot year(-1) (September) and quite evident changes on the
   pluviometric trends at annual and seasonal scales when the rainfall data
   are analysed for segments of 50 years from 1800 up to 2019. A good
   example could be the relevant change on the annual scale time trend,
   from +0.77 mm center dot year(-1) (years 1800-1850) to -0.17 mm center
   dot year(-1) (years 1950-2019). Clear evidences of decreasing
   pluviometry for spring, summer and autumn for the last segment
   (1950-2019) in comparison with the other three segments, including years
   1800-1950, are also detected. Additionally, increasing rainfall patterns
   complexity, expected difficulties on monthly rainfall forecasting and
   the increasing irregularity of monthly amounts is also detected by
   interpreting fractal and multifractal results. Irregularity increases on
   the monthly rainfall series and on the rainfall regime complexity
   derived from multifractal parameters, could be associated with the very
   notable increase of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, globally varying
   from 51.1 x 10(6) metric tonnes (year 1820) to 36.6 x 10(9) metric
   tonnes (year 2019) and the tropospheric concentration increasing from
   280.8 ppm (year 1850) to 397.5 ppm (year 2014), being the probable
   relationship between tropospheric concentrations and changes on rainfall
   patterns the objective of future researches.},

Title = {Chemical Characteristics and Trends of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall: A
   Review},
Journal = {AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {7, SI},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Indian summer monsoon (ISM) regulates the pace of life for billions
   of people in the Indian subcontinent by driving the agriculture and
   Gross Domestic Product of the region. The chemical composition of ISM is
   influenced by pollutant type, meteorology, and topography. As a result,
   the chemical makeup of rainwater varies greatly across places. The
   current review article highlights the variations and trends of the
   principal chemical constituents of rainwater (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH4+,
   NO3-, SO42-, and Cl-) across six homogeneous Indian monsoon regions:
   Central Northeast, Hilly, Northwest, Northeast, Peninsular and West
   Central region. Average rainwater pH ranged from 5.31 to 6.70 in these
   six regions. The incidence of acidic rain events at three separate
   locations in the Peninsular region suggests a significant impact of
   anthropogenic emissions. The chemical composition of rainwater in all
   these regions varied considerably and seemed to form a regional pattern.
   The majority of the ions in rainwater were highest in the Northwest
   while lowest in the Peninsular region. Cl- had a significant correlation
   with Na+ and NH4+ in the Hilly region, and with Na+ and Mg2+ in the West
   Central region suggesting it is sourced from both marine and
   anthropogenic sources. The soil Enrichment Factor relative to Ca2+
   demonstrated that soil has a significant effect on rainwater
   composition. Ca2+ was determined to be the most abundant neutralizing
   ion in all the regions. Furthermore, the synthesis of rainwater
   chemistry reveals a strong relationship with dominant interannual
   climate variability El Nino Southern Oscillation with significantly
   higher concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca+, Cl-, and SO4- in rainwater during
   El Nino year compared to La Nina year.},

Title = {Groundwater contamination in public water supply wells: risk assessment,
   evaluation of trends and impact of rainfall on groundwater quality},
Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study investigates the risk to contamination of groundwater in
   public water supply wells in the Koprivnica-Krizevci county (northwest
   Croatia). Five physicochemical parameters were monitored in all
   groundwater samples from 2008 to 2017 to identify major differences
   between the wells, assess temporal variations and understand the
   capacity for rainfall to alter groundwater pollution loadings.
   Multivariate discriminant analysis showed statistically significant
   differences between the six sampled wells based on the analyzed
   parameters (Wilks' lambda: 0.001; F = 26.2; p < 0.0000). Principal
   component analysis revealed two significant factors, including factor 1
   which explained 32.8\% of the variance (suggesting that the quality of
   the groundwater was mainly controlled by nitrate) and factor 2,
   accounting for 16.2\% of the total variance (which corresponded to
   KMnO4/oxidizability and to a lesser extent, pH). The time series data
   showed disparate trends, with nitrate concentrations increasing, whereas
   pH and KMnO4 decreased, while electrical conductivity and chloride
   levels remained stable. Although rainfall can impact groundwater
   pollution loadings through dilution processes in aquifers, the resulting
   fluctuations in physicochemical parameters are complicated by variations
   in rainfall events and local topography, as well as from climate change.
   Therefore, it is important to predict the contamination of groundwater
   quality in the future using machine learning algorithms using artificial
   neural network or similar methods. Multivariate statistical techniques
   are useful in verifying temporal and spatial variations caused by
   anthropogenic factors and natural processes linked to rainfall. The
   resulting identified risks to groundwater quality would provide the
   basis for further groundwater protection, particularly for decisions
   regarding permitted land use in recharge zones.},

Abstract = {The study explores the seasonal rainfall and rainy days trend in the
   Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan. Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope test was
   applied to detect the trend and magnitude of the trend for both the
   rainfall and rainy days. The trends are also analyzed with respect to
   the elevation of the climatic stations. Further, an attempt has been
   made to recognize the El-Ni no- Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-rainfall
   interaction using station-based rainfall with the ENSO cycle considering
   the period of 33 years. Cross-correlation of ENSO and rainfall with
   respect to elevation has also been presented. The trend analysis showed
   that in the localized regions, both the rainfall and rainy days trend
   was significantly declining, however, the trend in most of the stations
   is hardly conspicuous which may be attributed to the influence of the
   orographic phenomena. From the ENSO-rainfall assessment, it was observed
   that rainfall in the southern foothills correlates negatively with the
   ENSO phenomena indicating intense rainfall after 1-2 months of the
   cooling phase of the Pacific Ocean. However, such an ENSO effect is not
   observed in the majority of the meteorological stations which may be
   attributed to the location of the station in the mountainous region
   where the topography affects the rainfall variation.},

Abstract = {Adequate and consistent monsoonal rainfall is essential for the economic
   and societal well-being of India. Although many past studies analysed
   trends in Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) to capture any changes,
   the nature and consistency (stability) of those trends remained
   unexplored. Therefore, this study investigates the monotonic,
   non-monotonic, and trendless nature as well as the stability of ISMR
   trends from 1897 to 2016 using both graphical and statistical approaches
   for different meteorological sub-divisions of India. Also, the trend
   stability is examined considering high, medium, and low clusters of
   ISMR. Results show a predominance of monotonic trends in the long-term
   series, and maximum eastern sub-divisions exhibit a decreasing trend and
   vice versa. However, further analysis revealed instabilities in the ISMR
   trend and its respective clusters. The possible mechanisms behind ISMR
   instabilities and the spatio-temporal changes are discussed, along with
   certain methodological challenges, which might aid in formulating
   climate action plans.},

Abstract = {The spatiotemporal variability of rainfall, particularly in the context
   of climate change, has been imperative for examining the cropping
   patterns, farming sustainable crop production, and food security in
   rainfed areas. To that end, trend analysis was done to study the change
   in rainfall patterns in the mid-hills of Himachal Pradesh. The study
   investigated the historical rainfall data from 1971 to 2020 on a
   monthly, annual, seasonal, and decadal basis by using the variability
   analysis methods, viz., standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variance
   (CV), and transformed annual precipitation departure (Z). The trend
   analysis was also done by Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope estimator
   (SSE) test and linear regression model. The annual rainfall in the
   region was 1115.1 mm, which showed a decreasing trend (Z= - 0.79
   mm/year). Based on the linear regression model, the decrease in annual
   rainfall was about - 2.28 mm/year. The monthly and seasonal variability
   of rainfall exhibited a sensitivity to change. The months of January,
   April, July, and September showed an increasing trend, whereas the rest
   of the other months showed a decreasing trend. The seasonal rainfall
   (summer, monsoon, and post-monsoon) showed a decreasing trend, whereas
   the winter season depicted an increasing trend. During the entire study
   period, 1988 recorded as the wettest year, with highest annual rainfall
   of about 2205.0 mm and monsoon rainfall of about 1653.0 mm. The highest
   annual (2205.0 mm) and monsoon (1653.0 mm) rainfall was recorded in the
   year 1988. The decadal analysis of the rainfall on an annual basis
   revealed a decrease in rainfall during the periods 1971-1980, 2001-2010,
   and 2011-2020 as compared to 1981-1990 and 1991-2000. The rainfall over
   the study region confirms the strength of the change in trend. Thus, the
   erratic rainfall pattern makes the cropping calendar shorter and affects
   the agricultural productivity.},

Title = {Climate extremes related with rainfall in the State of Rio de Janeiro,
   Brazil: a review of climatological characteristics and recorded trends},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Number = {1},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper presents a synthesis of the main characteristics of
   precipitation in the State of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) based on extreme
   rainfall indicators. Daily precipitation data are derived from 56
   rainfall stations during the second half of the twentieth century and
   the 2000s. Eight indices related to extreme precipitation were analyzed.
   The Mann-Kendall nonparametric test and the Sen's Curvature were
   employed to evaluate the significance and magnitude of trends. The
   primary climatological aspects and identified trends throughout the last
   decades are discussed, besides the hydrometeorological impacts
   associated with them. Lower values of annual total precipitation are
   recorded in northern Rio de Janeiro (around 800 mm) and higher in the
   southern State (up to 2,200 mm). The Serra do Mar affects the frequency
   of heavy precipitation, and the areas near the sea and high relief
   present the highest values of consecutive days with expressive rainfall
   (more than 150 mm in 5 days). These areas also showed a high
   concentration of flood and landslides events. Most of Rio de Janeiro
   exhibits precipitation intensity of about 13 mm/day. The maximum number
   of consecutive dry days shows a gradient from the coast (about 30 days)
   to the State's interior (around 50 days). Regarding trends, there is a
   growth of accumulated extreme precipitation in various stations near the
   ocean. The extreme rainfall in 24 h displays an increase in most Rio de
   Janeiro (+ 1 to + 5 mm/decade). The consecutive dry and rainy days
   present similar signs of decreasing trends, suggesting irregularly
   distributed precipitation in the State. This study is especially
   relevant for decision-makers who need detailed information in the short
   and long term to prevent natural hazards like floods and landslides and
   the related impacts in the environmental and socioeconomic sectors of
   the Rio de Janeiro.},

Title = {Grid-Point Rainfall Trends, Teleconnection Patterns, and Regionalised
   Droughts in Portugal (1919-2019)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper describes the long-term grid-point rainfall trends in the
   context of climate change, recent regionalised rainfall decline and
   drought events for mainland Portugal, which is teleconnected, in most
   cases, to the trends of mathematical descriptions of the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) during the century from October 1919 to September
   2019. Grid-point rainfall dataset (1919-2019, from 126 centroids in a
   regular mesh over the country) have been constructed from high-quality
   ground-based data and as such, it provides a reliable source for the
   analysis of rainfall trends at different timescales: October-December,
   January-March, December-March, and the hydrological year. The
   Mann-Kendall (MK) coupled with Sen's slope estimator test are applied to
   quantify the trends. The Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) analysis is
   implemented to obtain the fluctuation of the progressive trends along
   the studied 100-year period. Because of their pivotal role in linking
   and synchronising climate variability, teleconnections to the North
   Atlantic Ocean are also explored to explain the rainfall trends over the
   Portuguese continuum. The results provide a solid basis to explain the
   climate change effects on the Portuguese rainfall based on significant
   associations with strong negative correlations between changes in
   rainfall and in NAO indices. These strong opposing correlations are
   displayed in most of the winter seasons and in the year. After the late
   1960s, a generalised rainfall decrease emerges against a background of
   significant upward trends of the NAO; such coupled behaviour has
   persisted for decades. Regionalised droughts at three identified
   climatic regions, based on factor analysis and Standardised
   Precipitation Index (SPI), are also discussed, concluding that the
   frequency of severe droughts may increase again, accompanied by a
   stronger influence of the recently more positive and unusual winter
   season and annual NAO indices.},

Abstract = {The Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) has been declining since the
   1950s. However, since 2002 it is reported to have revived. For these
   observed changes in the ISMR, several explanations have been reported.
   Among these explanations, however, the role of the eastern equatorial
   Indian Ocean (EEIO) is missing despite being one of the warmest regions
   in the Indian Ocean, and monotonously warming. A recent study reported
   that EEIO warming impacts the rainfall over northern India. Here we
   report that warming in the EEIO weakens the low-level Indian summer
   monsoon circulation and reduces ISMR. A warm EEIO drives easterly winds
   in the Indo-Pacific sector as a Gill response. The warm EEIO also
   enhances nocturnal convection offshore the western coast of Sumatra. The
   latent heating associated with the increased convection augments the
   Gill response and the resultant circulation opposes the monsoon
   low-level circulation and weakens the seasonal rainfall.},

Abstract = {The study investigated long-term trends and changes in rainfall
   magnitude and duration in a semi-arid catchment. It is crucial to
   determine changes in rainfall to support efforts to adapt to climate
   change in highly vulnerable semi-arid areas. Trends for long-term
   seasonal and annual rainfall magnitude and duration were determined
   using Mann-Kendall (MK) and quantile regression (QR) methods. Sen's
   slope was used to determine the magnitude of change in rainfall.
   Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the influence of
   altitude and land-use change in rainfall trends. There were dominant
   non-statistically significant decreasing trends for annual, seasonal
   rainfall magnitude, and rainfall duration. Trends from QR at low (0.1
   and 0.2) and high (0.7 and 0.9) quantiles mostly deviated from those of
   MK. There were weak and variable correlations of long-term rainfall
   trends with altitude and land-use change. Land-use change and topography
   may therefore not adequately explain the variations of trends. Further
   studies are essential to understand the interaction of environmental
   various factors and their influence on rainfall trends. Variations of
   trends will impact future water resource availability and allocation. It
   is important to consider the deviations when developing climate change
   adaptation measures and ensure improved decision-making.},

Abstract = {The predictability of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) at any
   given time period depends on the strength of its relationship with
   predictable drivers like the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) that
   are known to undergo significant epochal variations. While a similar
   relationship between the Eurasian snow cover fraction (SCF) and ISMR has
   also shown epochal variation in recent decades, its stationarity on
   centennial or longer timescales remains unknown. Here, on the basis of
   the observed relationship between the dominant modes of ISMR and SCF
   over a period of 115 years (1901-2015), we unravel two indices of SCF
   that encapsulate its space-time variability. We find that the SCF
   indices and ISMR relationship have a statistically significant
   increasing trend with a weak multidecadal variability superimposed on
   it, making significant positive correlations between the two highly
   probable in the coming decades. With SCF driving the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) that in turn driving the ISMR, we find that the NAO
   plays a pivotal role in modulating the SCF-ISMR teleconnection on a
   multidecadal time scale. Further, the SCF also regulates the ISMR
   low-frequency variability through modulation of the tropospheric
   temperature gradient of the Indian region.},

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Rainfall Dynamics of 120 Years (1901-2020)
   Using Innovative Trend Methodology: A Case Study of Haryana, India},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As we know, climate change and climate variability significantly
   influence the most important component of global hydrological cycle,
   i.e., rainfall. The study pertaining to change in the spatio-temporal
   patterns of rainfall dynamics is crucial to take appropriate actions for
   managing the water resources at regional level and to prepare for
   extreme events such as floods and droughts. Therefore, our study has
   investigated the spatio-temporal distribution and performance of
   seasonal rainfall for all districts of Haryana, India. The gridded
   rainfall datasets of 120 years (1901 to 2020) from the India
   Meteorological Department (IMD) were categorically analysed and examined
   with statistical results using mean rainfall, rainfall deviation,
   moving-average, rainfall categorization, rainfall trend, correlation
   analysis, probability distribution function, and climatology of heavy
   rainfall events. During each season, the eastern districts of Haryana
   have received more rainfall than those in its western equivalent.
   Rainfall deviation has been positive during the pre-monsoon season,
   while it has been negative for all remaining seasons during the third
   quad-decadal time (QDT3, covering the period of 1981-2020); rainfall has
   been declining in most of Haryana's districts during the winter, summer
   monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons in recent years. The Innovative Trend
   Analysis (ITA) shows a declining trend in rainfall during the winter,
   post-monsoon, and summer monsoon seasons while an increasing trend
   occurs during the pre-monsoon season. Heavy rainfall events (HREs) were
   identified for each season from the last QDT3 (1981-2020) based on the
   available data and their analysis was done using European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim),
   which helped in understanding the dynamics of atmospheric parameters
   during HREs. Our findings are highlighting the qualitative and
   quantitative aspects of seasonal rainfall dynamics at the districts
   level in Haryana state. This study is beneficial in understanding the
   impact of climate change and climate variability on rainfall dynamics in
   Haryana, which may further guide the policymakers and beneficiaries for
   optimizing the use of hydrological resources.},

Abstract = {A procedure aimed at forecasting the velocity trend of a landslide for a
   period of some hours to one or two days is proposed here together with
   its MATLAB implementation. The method is based on continuous wavelet
   transform (CWT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to
   rainfall and velocity time series provided by a real-time monitoring
   system. It is aimed at recognizing the conditions that induce a strong
   increase, or even a significant decrease, in the average velocity of the
   unstable slope. For each evaluation time, the rainfall and velocity
   scalograms related to the previous days (e.g., two weeks) are computed
   by means of CWT. A CNN recognizes the velocity trend defined in the
   training stage corresponds to these scalograms. In this way, forecasts
   about the start, persistence, and end of a critical event can be
   provided to the decision makers. An application of the toolbox to a
   landslide (Perarolo di Cadore landslide, Eastern Alps, Italy) is also
   briefly described to show how the parameters can be chosen in a real
   case and the corresponding performance.},

Title = {Spatial and Temporal Variability of Rainfall Trends in Response to
   Climate Change-A Case Study: Syria},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent climate changes have prompted changes in the hydrological cycle
   at a global scale, creating instability when predicting future climate
   conditions and related changes. Perturbations in global climate models
   have created the need to concentrate consequent changes in hydro
   climatic factors to comprehend the regional and territorial impacts of
   climate and environmental changes. Syria, as a Middle East country, is
   exposed to extreme climate events such as drought and flood. The aim of
   this study is to analyze rainfall trends in Syria in response to the
   likely climate change. The analysis was conducted for rainfall data
   collected from 71 stations distributed all over the country for the
   period (1991-2009). The trend analysis was performed in monthly and
   seasonal scales using Mann-Kendall non-parametric statistical tests. The
   results attained from Mann-Kendall trend analysis revealed decreasing
   trends at most of the stations. Additionally, rainfall analysis was
   conducted for the stations with significant trends for wet and dry
   periods, which also revealed decreasing trends at almost all the
   stations. From the analysis of the results, it is obvious that slight
   increasing trends in rainfall in Syria occurred in the fall period.
   However, in the winter and spring periods, significant decreasing trends
   have been observed at almost all the stations. This reveals that the
   country will suffer from shortage of water, because most rainfall occurs
   in the winter and spring, infrequently in fall and rarely in summer. The
   results are consistent with the IPCC's fifth report that predicted a
   decrease in rainfall in the Mediterranean and southern Asia. The results
   of this paper could help the management of water resources in Syria
   considering future climate changes.},

Title = {Increasing trends in rainfall erosivity in the Yellow River basin from
   1971 to 2020},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {610},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Hourly precipitation data from 1971 to 2020, collected from 98 stations
   distributed across the Yellow River basin, were analyzed to detect
   changes in characteristics on rainfall and rainfall erosivity for all
   storms and storms with extreme erosivity (greater than 90th percentile).
   Results showed that over the past 50 years, rainfall erosivity at both
   event and seasonal scales over the whole basin increased significantly
   (p < 0.05) with rates of 5.46\% and 6.86\% decade-1, respectively,
   compared to the 1981-2010 average values. Approximate 80\% of 98
   stations showed increasing trends and 20\% of stations had statistically
   significant trends (p < 0.1). The increase of rainfall erosivity
   resulted from the significant increasing trends of average storm
   precipitation (p < 0.1), duration (p < 0.1), rainfall energy (p < 0.05)
   and maximum 1-h intensity (p < 0.05). In addition, the total extreme
   erosivity showed significant upward trends at a relative rate of 6.05\%
   decade(-1) (p < 0.05). Extreme erosivity storms occurred more frequently
   and with higher rainfall energy during the study period (p < 0.05).
   Trends for seasonal total and extreme erosivity were also estimated
   based on daily rainfall data, and the changing magnitudes were similar
   to those based on hourly rainfall data, which suggested daily rainfall
   can be applied to detect interannual and long-term variations of
   rainfall erosivity in the absence of rainfall data with higher
   resolution. It was suggested that soil and water conservation strategies
   and vegetation projects conducted within the Yellow River basin should
   be continued and enhanced in the future.},

Title = {Trends in rainfall extremity and peak flood in Sabarmati River Basin,
   India},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is important to recognize the trend of the extreme rainfall and its
   influence on peak flood event occurrences. This study analyzes the
   trends in the rainfall extremity and the trend in the peak river flood
   in the Sabarmati River basin of India and its sub-basins/sub-regions.
   Five indices have been considered for the assessment of extreme rainfall
   evaluation and trend detection. Results of the trend of each index is
   coherent with the trend of observed peak flood in Sabarmati River basin.
   The spatial distribution of trend of intense rainfall has been obtained
   by aggregating the spatial distribution of indices for maximum 1-day
   rainfall of the year (MR-1 day), and number/count of heavy rainfall days
   (Rheavy) in GIS in each sub-basin of the study area. It is concluded
   that the positive trend in the intense rainfall index govern the
   positive trend with a strong correlation in the peak river flood in the
   Sabarmati River sub-basins. The study will be helpful for infrastructure
   facilities and services such as storm water drain and water storage
   structure design and operation etc., and to prevent the damages due to
   extreme events in the river basin area.},

Abstract = {In this study, we analysed the variability and trends in annual as well
   as seasonal rainfall in the seven states of North East India for the
   period 1901-2020, using non-parametric tests like Mann-Kendall,
   trend-free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall, modified Mann-Kendall (MMK), as
   well as using the innovative trend analysis (ITA). The study revealed
   the variabilities in annual and seasonal rainfall in these seven states.
   In most cases, the results of all the tests were identical. However,
   significant differences were observed in the case of post-monsoon
   rainfall of Assam and Meghalaya, pre-monsoon rainfall of Arunachal
   Pradesh, Mizoram and Tripura, as well as in winter rainfall of Arunachal
   Pradesh and monsoon rainfall of Tripura. Compared to the other states of
   NE India and other tests, ITA detected no significant annual trend for
   Tripura; however, the winter season exhibited a decreasing trend. It was
   observed that only the MMK test could predict such changes in rainfall
   distribution across seasons to a certain extent at varying significance
   levels in comparison to the other three methods. Since these states are
   vulnerable to water-related disasters, this study could help
   policymakers arrive at valuable climatic and water resource management
   decisions.},

Title = {Characteristics and trends of rainstorm activities and their impacts on
   seasonal vegetation variations in coastal China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {138},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Within the context of global climate changes, rainstorms have
   increasingly become one of the important ecological interferences
   limiting plant growth and population turnover. However, due to the
   significant spatial and temporal variability of rainstorms, determining
   their quantitative relationships with plant growth at some longer
   temporal and larger spatial scales is challenging. In this study, the
   relationships between rainstorm changes and vegetation activities are
   explored by analysing the spatial and temporal correlations between the
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and rainstorm frequency on
   the coast of China during the period of 1982-2015. Our results show
   that: (1) Both rainstorm frequency and vegetation activities tend to
   increase gradually over the study period. The impact of rainstorms on
   vegetation in the northern part of the study area is greater than that
   in the southern part. (2) Overall, rainstorms have a significant (p <
   0.1) negative impact on vegetation activities in the northern parts of
   the study area, especially during the summer months. Furthermore, the
   negative impact of rainstorms on vegetation in autumn tends to be
   strengthened into the future. (3) Rainstorms overall have significant
   and negative impacts on shrub, coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest
   during the growing season. The strong-impact seasons and locations of
   rainstorm on vegetation activities identified by our study can
   dramatically benefit future ecosystem and water resource management in
   coastal China.},

Title = {Urban rainfall in the Capitals of Brazil: Variability, trend, and
   wavelet analysis},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {267},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The patterns of urban rainfall in Brazil's capitals are critical, due to
   population growth and extreme weather. Therefore, the objectives are: i)
   to identify homogeneous rainfall groups and meteorological systems, ii)
   to evaluate the trend of the monthly rainfall time series and iii) to
   apply wavelet analysis to estimate the variance at different frequencies
   in the rainfall series in the capitals of the Brazil. Monthly rainfall
   data during 1960-2020 for 27 stations located in the capitals of Brazil
   were used. The data were flawed, and data imputation (mtsdi package) was
   applied via Fully Conditional Specification (FCS). Rainfall data were
   submitted to descriptive, exploratory statistics (boxplot), multivariate
   analysis (Cluster Analysis - CA) and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Seven
   CA methods (Ward, Single, Complete, Average, McQuity, Median and
   Centroid) were tested using the cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC)
   with a significance level of 5\%, the Average method obtained CCC > 0.81
   (S). The CA identified three homogeneous regions (G1, G2 and G3) in the
   capitals of Brazil. The G1 group is formed by the capitals of the
   Northeast of Brazil (NEB), except for Boa Vista, (North of Brazil - NB).
   The G2 group is the largest group formed by the capitals of the Midwest
   (MWB), Southeast (SEB) and South (SB) of Brazil. The G3 group is the
   smallest group, with the capitals of the NB and some of the NEB. The
   capitals with the category of significant growth trend were only Porto
   Alegre and Florian acute accent opolis (SB), Vit acute accent oria (SEB)
   and Bele acute accent m (NB). The category of non-significant increase
   trend prevailed in most capitals of Brazil, with emphasis on the
   corridor formed between the NB and the Center-South, except for Natal
   (NEB). The without trend category prevailed in the North, Northeast and
   Midwest regions of Brazil. Monthly precipitation analyzes for trend
   detection purposes via Wavelet Analysis showed that ENSO phases are
   significant in rainfall variability in Brazilian capitals.},

Abstract = {Sabarmati basin (SB) in India has been experiencing decreased rainfall
   since 1960s. In the monsoon season, maximum reduction in number of rainy
   days was observed in the SB. Thus, study of rainfall in the SB is
   necessary. Therefore, gridded rainfall data of the SB corresponding to
   annual, seasonal and monthly temporal scales is used for trend analyses
   for the period of 54 years??? (1951 to 2004) through application of
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test, MK test with block-boot strapping, Sen???s slope
   test, smoothing curve and plot of innovative trend analysis. The results
   showed that, statistically significant trends (SSTs) are present at very
   few grid points of annual, winter, pre-monsoon and monsoon rainfall data
   and these SSTs are decreasing trends. Thus, if the same trend persists
   in future, then there will be scarcity of water and more strain on the
   management of water resources at the given grids in corresponding
   temporal scales.},

Abstract = {Study of rainfall trend is of great importance in India where food
   security and economy primarily dependent on rainfall. Present work is
   carried out to perform the detailed analysis of temporal variability in
   North East India rainfall. Temporal variation in monthly, seasonal and
   annual rainfall over northeast India (NEI) is studied using monthly data
   for 150 years (1857-2006). Magnitude of trend in time series data is
   determined by using both parametric and non-parametric test, i.e.,
   linear regression and Man-Kendall test. Analysis of data suggests a
   significant decrease in monsoon rainfall and increase in post monsoon
   rainfall. Influence of global teleconnection like North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) and Southern Oscillation (SO) on NEI rainfall is also
   studied to address the temporal variation. To carry out detail analysis,
   time series rainfall data is further divided into five normal periods of
   30 year each: 1857-1886 (P1), 1887-1916 (P2), 1917-1946 (P3), 1947-1976
   (P4) and 1977-2006 (P5) and trend analysis on seasonal rainfall
   performed for above mentioned periods. Decreasing trend for four out of
   the five classified periods for monsoon rainfall and significant
   increase in three periods obtained for post monsoon rainfall. 11 year
   running mean also calculated for annual as well as seasonal rainfall to
   see the changes in rainfall pattern.},

Abstract = {Fluctuations or variations in climatic parameters is a recurring
   phenomenon in India. The effects of climate variability exacerbate
   existing social and economic encounters across the area. Over the last
   115 years, the rainfall patterns in India have changed significantly.
   The most significant change is the shifting of the monsoon season
   altogether. This study aims to discuss the significant changes of
   rainfall pattern and their influence in Sikkim state, India. Daily
   rainfall data of 115 years from 1901 to 2015 has been processed in the
   study to find out the monthly variability of rainfall for which
   Mann-Kendall (MK) Test together with the Sen's Slope Estimator for the
   determination of trend and slope magnitude. Monthly precipitation trend
   has been identified here to achieve the objective, which has been shown
   with 115 years of data. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's estimation tests
   indicated significant changing patterns in the frequency and intensity
   of the rainfall across the Sikkim in an intra-decadal time series
   domain. It has been noted in this study that the Sikkim region observed
   drastic rainfall pattern changes after 2001, because of which there was
   an increase in disasters like landslides and floods., This study also
   used inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and reclassify
   tool to produce the maps for identifying the pattern and region that
   caused more rainfall. NDVI (Vegetation Index) has also shown the drastic
   changes in south Sikkim of vegetation due to decreased rainfall,
   urbanisation. NDVI values gradually risefrom spring to rainy season and
   fall steadily from autumn to winter.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal rainfall variability analysis at a basin scale is
   essential to understand water availability for sustainable water
   resource management. This study investigated the spatial distribution
   and temporal rainfall trend in the Tekeze river basin using daily
   rainfall data collected from 43 meteorological stations with records
   from 1960 to 2019. Coefficient of variation, seasonality index (SI) and
   trend index were used to evaluate monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall
   variability in the basin. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall's test was
   used to understand any rainfall trends. Results showed that there is
   moderate annual rainfall variability in the basin. Rainfall variability
   is higher in the Tsedey, Bega and Belg than kiremt season. SI results
   showed that majority of the Tekeze river basin is categorized as
   seasonal, most of the rain occurring in less than 3 months. Overall,
   Mann-Kendall's test result revealed that there is no significant annual
   rainfall trend in the basin except for four stations. The seasonal
   rainfall characteristics and short duration of rain in the basin
   indicate that there is a need to implement water harvesting measures
   during the wet season for use in the dry periods.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal seasonal and annual
   trends of rainfall indices in Perak, Malaysia, during the last 35 years,
   as any seasonal or spatial variability in rainfall may influence the
   regional hydrological cycle and water resources. Mann-Kendall and
   Sequential Mann- Kendall (SMK) tests were used to assess seasonal and
   annual trends. Precipitation concentration index was used to estimate
   variations in rainfall concentration, and Theil-Sen's slope estimator
   was used to determine the spatial variability of rainfall. It was found
   that most of the rainfall indices are showing decreasing trends, and it
   was most prominent for the southwest monsoon season with a decreasing
   rate of 2.20 mm/year. The long-term trends for seasonal rainfall showed
   that rainfall declined by 0.29 mm/year during the southwest monsoon. In
   contrast, the northeast and the intermonsoon seasons showed slight
   increases. Rainfall decreased gradually from 1994 to 2008, and the trend
   became more pronounced in 2008. On a spatial basis, rainfall trends have
   shifted from the western regions (i.e., -19 mm/year) to the southeastern
   regions (i.e., 10 mm/year). Overall, slightly decreasing trends in
   rainfall were observed in Perak Malaysia.},

Abstract = {Changes in rainfall patterns can have a profound impact on water
   availability, and therefore, examining the variability of rainfall is
   critical in addressing water resources and regional climate change.
   Tripura state of northeast India is known to have received a high amount
   of rainfall in the past few decades, but currently the region suffers
   from water shortage as soon as the rainy season retreats. Here, we use
   the surface, satellite and reanalysis data of Tripura in 1986-2019 to
   examine the seasonal and annual trends in rainfall. The satellite and
   reanalysis data agree very well with the surface rainfall measurements
   for Tripura and reproduce the seasonal and inter-annual variability. We
   find a decreasing trend in the seasonal and annual averaged rainfall at
   most stations for the period 1986-2019. The monsoon rainfall is
   declining at a rate of 0.025-0.216 mm/year, with the highest rate of
   -0.216 mm/year at the Sabroom station during the period. The correlation
   analysis of rainfall with land use and land cover (LULC) suggests the
   impact of LULC on rainfall; indicating the anthropogenic influence in
   rainfall changes there. Our analysis also shows a substantial increase
   in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal sea surface temperature (SST) after
   2000, and the changes in SST with respect to the El Nino, La Nina and
   Indian Ocean Dipole events contribute significantly to the rainfall
   variability in the region; suggesting plausible causes of recent changes
   in regional climate in the northeast.},

Abstract = {This study investigates rainfall and drought characteristics in
   southeastern Australia (New South Wales and Victoria) using data from 45
   rainfall stations. Four homogeneity tests are adopted to determine
   inhomogeneities in the annual total rainfall (ATR) and monthly rainfall
   data, namely The Pettitt test, the SNHT, the Buishand range test and the
   Von Neumann ratio test at significance levels of 1\%, 5\%, and 10\%.
   Temporal trends in rainfall (ATR, monthly, and seasonal) and droughts
   are examined using autocorrelated Mann-Kendall (A-MK) trend test at 1\%,
   5\%, and 10\% significance levels. We also assess meteorological
   droughts by using multiple drought indices (3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 24-, and
   36-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Effective Drought
   Index (EDI)). Furthermore, spatial variability of temporal trends in
   rainfall and drought are investigated through interpolation of Sen's
   slope estimator. The results represent an increasing trend in ATR
   between 1920 and 2019. However, southeast Australia is highly dominated
   by a significant negative trend in the medium term between 1970 and
   2019. Winter is found to be dominated by a significantly negative trend,
   whereas summer and spring seasons are dominated by a positive trend.
   April is detected as the driest month according to magnitude of Sen's
   slope and the A-MK test result. Positive trends on droughts are observed
   at inner parts of the study area, whereas a negative trend is detected
   in the south, southeast, and northeast of the study area based on SPIs
   and EDI. The findings of this study help to understand changes in
   rainfall and droughts in southeastern Australia.},

Abstract = {Under the background of global warming, an analysis of the trend and
   variability of rainfall time series on various timescales is very
   important for understanding climate change on a regional scale. In this
   study, a trend analysis of rainfall time series on monthly, seasonal,
   and annual scales in Shanxi province, China, during the period 1957-2019
   was conducted using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator.
   Statistical characteristics and the distribution of rainfall were
   examined using commonly used statistical indicators and the
   precipitation concentration index (PCI). Three rainfall-based indices,
   standardized anomaly index (SAI), rainfall anomaly index (RAI), and
   standardized precipitation index (SPI), were used to investigate the
   rainfall variability and drought conditions in Shanxi province over the
   period 1957-2019. The results showed that a statistically significant
   decreasing trend occurred in March and July at significance levels of
   1\% and 10\%, respectively. Spring and autumn showed an upward trend,
   and summer and winter exhibited a downward trend. An insignificant
   decreasing trend was detected for the annual rainfall series. Summer
   experienced the largest decrease rate of rainfall (-0.808 mm/year). The
   climate of Shanxi province is gradually becoming dry. However, rainfall
   presented a recovery tendency after entering the twenty-first century.
   The findings in this study can provide useful information for
   agricultural production, water resource planning, and socioeconomic
   development.},

Abstract = {The effect of climate change on human life has led the scientific
   community to observe the behaviour of meteorological and climatic
   variables on various spatial and temporal scales. However, analysing
   precipitation trends is important for studying the impact of climate
   change on water resource planning and management. This study examines
   changes in rainfall data at-site location in Duhok city, Kurdistan
   Region, Iraq using rainfall data for 42 years covering the period of
   1976-2017. The quality control test was performed for rainfall data
   series using Mandel's k method. The non-parametric tests (Mann-Kendall
   and Modified Mann-Kendall) with the Innovative Trend Analysis method
   have been used to assess the change in monthly, seasonal, and annual
   rainfall series. Also, the homogeneity in rainfall data series has been
   investigated using Van Bell and Hughes homogeneity, Runs, Pettit,
   Standard Normal Homogeneity, Buishand Range, and Von Neumann Rate tests.
   The results of Mandel's k method showed that no outlier was detected in
   the study area. The trend test results revealed an increasing trend in
   some rainfall data series and a decreasing trend in some other data
   series in the study area. The maximum increasing significant trend has
   been observed in January and Winter series at a 5\% significance level.
   In addition, the set cases of monthly and seasonal data series were
   found to be nonhomogeneous, while according to each separate case of
   time series, it has been found that the most of data series appears to
   be homogeneous.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a worldwide problem that is facing the globe in
   different aspects. To investigate this phenomenon, research has been
   conducted to check whether climate change is affecting the western part
   of Jerusalem Governorate or not. Long-term data on annual, seasonal and
   monthly rainfall were collected from different sources and analyzed for
   long-term monthly and annual trends. Results showed significant (p<
   0.05) decrease in the annual rainfall, with about 7.3 mm decadal
   reduction during 1850-2018. The highest and significant decrease in
   decadal rainfall occurred during 1890-1939 and 1980-2018, with a decadal
   decrease of 50.9 mm and 55.9 mm, respectively. The decrease corresponds
   to 84 mm reduction in annual rainfall since 1850, which could be
   attributed to the extended effect of the GHG from the industrial
   revolution on Palestine since the beginning of the 20 th century. A
   significant and increasing trend in drought periods was also obvious,
   with 1.7 years of drought/decade and an increasing drought recurrence
   during 1920-1930 and 1998-2018 periods (69\% of the drought years
   occurred in the two periods). Winter season showed highest and
   significant reduction in rainfall than spring season (1.7 mm/decade and
   0.7 mm/decade, respectively), whereas autumn season showed a
   non-significant decadal decrease in rainfall of about 0.04 mm/decade.
   The reduction in rainfall and the recurrence of more drought periods,
   especially the last 20 years, might be the cause for the concurrent
   reduction in rainfed agricultural areas in Palestine; about 38\%
   reduction in the total rainfed areas (1515 km(2) in 2000 to 929 km(2) in
   2017/2018).},

   1981-2018: A Trend-EOF Approach},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {The Andes mountain range divides Colombia into various climatic regions
   over the country, as the Andean, Caribbean, Pacific, Amazon, and Orinoco
   regions. Given this scenario, knowing the current change in total
   precipitation and their extremes values are relevant. In this study, the
   main goal is to assess the spatio-temporal trends of heavy and intense
   rainfall at a seasonal scale during the last 38 years (1981-2018) using
   the trend empirical orthogonal function (TEOF). An increase in maximum
   precipitation during five consecutive days (RX5day), Simple daily
   intensity index (SDII), and the number of days with precipitation above
   20 mm (R20mm) and 30 mm (R30mm) during December-February and March-May
   was observed in most of the Colombian territory, except for the Amazon
   region for RX5day. A decrease in total rainfall in June-August was
   observed in the Andean, the Caribbean, and southern Pacific regions,
   while, in the northern Pacific, it increased, consistent with the trend
   patterns of RX5day, SDII, and R20mm. During September-November, there
   was a reduction in rainfall in the Amazon region and the South Pacific,
   and an increase in RX5day, SDII, R20mm, and R30mm in the Andean, the
   Caribbean, and North Pacific regions. The TEOF showed more pronounced
   spatial trend patterns than those obtained with the traditional
   Mann-Kendall test. The findings offer a better understanding of the
   climate extremes impacts in tropical latitudes and help planners to
   implement measures against the future effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {The main objectives of this paper are to get a better understand of the
   rainfall space-time variability and to assess its rainfall tendency in
   the Merguellil basin, central Tunisia, by means of statistical tests. We
   assessed the rainfall at seasonal and monthly scales. Based on the
   availability of a continuous good record, eleven rain gauges were
   carefully chosen. Monthly rainfall data range from 1980 to 2016. Two
   tests are used to examine the trends: the non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   and Sen's slope were selected to detect the existence, with a
   statistical significance, of an increase or a decrease in rainfall data
   trend. Results revealed high space-time variability of rainfall showing
   significant changes in seasonal and monthly rainfall amounts, for the
   studied period, particularly for summer months. The rise ranges from
   0.68 mm/yr to 2.08 mm/yr and the highest values are observed in the
   basin upstream. Consequently, there are signs of a considerable rainfall
   raise in the basin. Increasing trends in summer, especially in July and
   August, were detected in the majority of studied rain gauges, where the
   monthly upward varies between 0.46 mm/yr and 0.83 mm/year. Most of the
   calculated slopes are statistically significant and the changes in
   Merguellil basin are more significant compared to other studies.},

Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Nowadays, the Mediterranean region is generally recognized as a climate
   change hot spot given its strong response to global warming, with
   relevant impacts on rainfall amount and distribution. Within this
   context, in this work the temporal variability of rainfall at annual,
   seasonal and monthly scale was analyzed in Italy using rainfall data
   extracted from the reanalysis dataset ERA5-Land during the period
   1950-2020. In particular, rainfall trend magnitude and significance have
   been estimated by means of non-parametric tests applied to 3215 grid
   points falling within the Italian territory. The main results of this
   analysis evidenced only a few relevant trends at the annual scale,
   mostly involving northern Italy (positive trend) and the Sardinia region
   (negative trend). At seasonal scale, the results showed a marked
   negative trend in winter, characterizing almost all the Italian
   territory, while in the other seasons a positive trend was identified in
   the majority of grid points, especially in the Alps. Finally, at the
   monthly scale, September was identified as the month of the year with
   the highest percentage of grid points with positive trends mainly
   located in central, southern, and north-eastern Italy.},

Title = {Analysis and forecasting of rainfall trends in semi-arid Bundelkhand
   region of Madhya Pradesh, India: using statistical methods},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {81},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The present study is mainly concerned with one of the crucial climatic
   variables, i.e., precipitation for analyzing the trend of rainfall in
   five districts (Chhatarpur, Damoh, Panna, Sagar, Tikamgarh) of the
   Bundelkhand region (a semi-arid region) of Madhya Pradesh. In this
   region, agriculture is the single most important activity in sustaining
   livelihoods, and though several irrigation schemes are being operated,
   the quality of irrigation services is poor and most of the cultivated
   land is still dependent on rainfall. Hence, examining the temporal
   variation of rainfall is vital and it will help to assess
   climatic-induced changes and suggest feasible adaptation strategies.
   Statistical analysis techniques like the Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope
   estimator, the MGCTI ``Bertin matrix{''} and climate extreme indices
   (CDD, R95p and RX1Day) were used to estimate the seasonal, monthly and
   annual rainfall trend and its variability for the period from 1951 to
   2018. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) has
   been used for the forecasting of annual rainfall in this study area from
   2019 to 2050. The Results show that there is no significant trend in the
   annual rainfall pattern, though in every case it is negative (Sen
   slope). The summer and winter season of each district had above 75\% of
   CV, highlighting the extremely high variability of precipitation. The
   Regional index showed that the second half of the study period was more
   drought prone than the previous one, indicating a clear symptom of
   climate change. The annual decrease in rainfall from the ARIMA model
   (2019-2050) for the region is 7.60 mm per year, though spatial variation
   is also observed from ARIMA predictions.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to analyze the intensity of daily extreme
   rainfall and trends for precipitation in Castro, Curitiba and Paranagu
   \& PRIME;a stations, located in the state of Paran \& PRIME;a, Brazil.
   Historical series of rainfall registered by the Brazilian National
   Institute of Meteorology were used considering the period from 1976 to
   2015. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt statistical tests were applied to
   identify trends and ruptures in historical rainfall series. Other
   indicators of trends in rainfall and temperature were calculated using
   the RClimDex software, developed by the Canadian Meteorological System.
   The classification of cumulative daily rainfall in 24 h with the
   application of the quantile technique was defined as a standard for
   percentiles. The months of January, February and December presented
   greater occurrence frequency of rainfall equal to or greater than 95\%
   and 99\% of the quantiles for all locations. The comparative analysis
   showed that Paranagu \& PRIME;a station has the largest accumulated
   values of rainfall in 24 h during the rainiest months, between September
   and April, while Castro and Curitiba stations recorded the highest daily
   totals between May and August. Increasing daily precipitation totals
   were identified in all quantile's classes with statistical significance
   only in Curitiba and Paranagu \& PRIME;a station, which is attributed to
   greater urban densities and its direct impacts over daily rainfall
   totals. Significant trends for increased rainfall were observed,
   especially in Curitiba, a condition that is associated with the
   expressive and also significant increase in climate indicators of air
   temperature.},

Title = {Development Trend and Stability Analysis of Creep Landslide With Obvious
   Slip Zone Under Rainfall-Taking Xinchang Xiashan Basalt Slope as an
   Example},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {The creep slope is a dynamic development process, from stable
   deformation to instability failure. For the slope with sliding zone, it
   generally creeps along the sliding zone. If the sliding zone controlling
   the slope sliding does not have obvious displacement, and the slope has
   unexpected instability without warning, the harm and potential safety
   hazard are often much greater than the visible creep. Studying the
   development trend of this kind of landslide is of great significance to
   slope treatment and landslide early warning. Taking Xiashan village
   landslide in Huishan Town, Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province as an
   example, the landslide point was determined by numerical simulation in
   2006. Generally, the landslide is a typical long-term slow deformation
   towards the free direction. Based on a new round of investigation and
   monitoring, this paper shows that there are signs of creeping on the
   surface of the landslide since 2003, and there is no creep on the deep
   sliding surface. The joint fissures in the landslide area are relatively
   developed, and rainfall infiltration will soften the soft rock and soil
   layer and greatly reduce its stability. This paper collects and arranges
   the rainfall data of the landslide area in recent 30 years, constructs
   the slope finite element model considering rainfall conditions through
   ANSYS finite element software, and carries out numerical simulation
   stability analysis. The results show that if cracks appear below or
   above the slope's sliding surface, or are artificially damaged, the
   sliding surface may develop into weak cracks. Then, the plastic zone of
   penetration is offset; In the case of heavy rain, the slope can unload
   itself under the action of rainfall. At this time, the slope was
   unstable and the landslide happened suddenly.},

   Data (1983-2020): Towards Climate Change Resilience and Adaptation},

Abstract = {This study reveals rainfall variability and trends in the African
   continent using TAMSAT data from 1983 to 2020. In the study, a
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator were used to analyze
   rainfall trends and their magnitude, respectively, under monthly,
   seasonal, and annual timeframes as an indication of climate change using
   different natural and geographical contexts (i.e., sub-regions, climate
   zones, major river basins, and countries). The study finds that the
   highest annual rainfall trends were recorded in Rwanda (11.97 mm/year),
   the Gulf of Guinea (river basin 8.71 mm/year), the tropical rainforest
   climate zone (8.21 mm/year), and the Central African region (6.84
   mm/year), while Mozambique (-0.437 mm/year), the subtropical northern
   desert (0.80 mm/year), the west coast river basin of South Africa
   (-0.360 mm/year), and the Northern Africa region (1.07 mm/year) show the
   lowest annual rainfall trends. There is a statistically significant
   increase in the rainfall in the countries of Africa's northern and
   central regions, while there is no statistically significant change in
   the countries of the southern and eastern regions. In terms of climate
   zones, in the tropical northern desert climates, tropical northern
   peninsulas, and tropical grasslands, there is a significant increase in
   rainfall over the entire timeframe of the month, season, and year. This
   implies that increased rainfall will have a positive effect on the food
   security of the countries in those climatic zones. Since a large
   percentage of Africa's agriculture is based only on rainfall (i.e.,
   rain-fed agriculture), increasing trends in rainfall can assist climate
   resilience and adaptation, while declining rainfall trends can badly
   affect it. This information can be crucial for decision-makers concerned
   with effective crop planning and water resource management. The rainfall
   variability and trend analysis of this study provide important
   information to decision-makers that need to effectively mitigate drought
   and flood risk.},

Abstract = {The importance of rainfall cannot be ignored. Fluctuations in rainfall
   can majorly impact people and especially the economy of a country that
   is majorly dependent on agriculture. Availability of water has a direct
   relation with the rainfall received over that region. This paper is on
   the trend analysis of rainfall in Jaipur, the capital city of the Indian
   state of Rajasthan. Temporal variation for monthly, seasonal
   (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and non-monsoon period), and annual rainfall
   trend analysis is done for the period of 61 years, ranging from 1957 to
   2017. The major contribution of this paper is to identify whether there
   is an uptrend or a downtrend in the amount of precipitation received in
   the area under study. Daily rainfall data is collected from eight rain
   gauge stations installed by Water Resource Department, Govt of
   Rajasthan, fixed at various locations in the Jaipur district. It can be
   observed from the analysis that major rainfall occurs during the monsoon
   season (June-July-August-September).},

Abstract = {This work concerns the temporal and spatial analysis of daily and

   indices of precipitation extremes in 16 meteorological stations have
   been analysed using the innovative approach with a period between 1970
   to 2008. This method is based on visual analysis of trend and contrary
   to other classical approach, not requires restrictive assumptions for
   its application. The indices used in this study concern the intensity,
   duration and frequency of rainfall events. The major results of this
   work concern the increase of extreme rainfall events in many parts of
   the target area and an opposite tendency for dry spells. These facts
   lead to suppose a better situation in terms of water resources but an
   aggravation of the flood situation, which is known this part of the
   country.},

Abstract = {The results of rainwater chemistry monitoring in the Tatra Mountains,
   Poland, during the periods 1993-1994 and 2002-2019 were used to
   determine long-term trends and the factors influencing rainwater
   chemistry in the last two decades. In the early 1990's, the study area
   was characterized by prominent acid rains with a pH of 4.4 that affected
   surface water, meadows, and forest ecosystems. A rising pH temporal
   trend has been observed during the following years, indicating improving
   air quality. This trend has also been observed in measured ionic
   concentrations and reduced wet deposition loads of sulfur- and
   nitrogen-containing acid-forming compounds. The neutralization capacity
   of rainwater in Kasprowy Wierch increased over the last twenty years and
   has mostly been dominated by NH4+. The ammonium availability index has
   been steadily increasing between years 2002 and 2019 but remains less
   than 1. This statistically significant relationship also indicates that
   a portion of neutralization occurs in the lower part of the atmosphere
   due to ammonium-related neutralization processes. The acidic potential
   (AP) and the ratio AP/NP (acidic potential/neutralization potential)
   have been declining during the same time. The stated trends in rainwater
   chemistry reflect the transformation to more environmentally sustainable
   economies in the region. Similar changes have been observed in
   neighboring countries in the region, including Slovakia, the Czech
   Republic, and Lithuania.},

Abstract = {In this study, the rainy trend in Philippines started to increase in
   2008 and seems to plateau until it declines in 2014. This study conforms
   to the global phenomenon brought about by El Nino. This paper also
   acknowledges research finding that in 2015-2016, dry El Nino conditions
   affected about a third of the country. This one-third is mostly situated
   in the northern part of the Philippines.
   A model is good if its performance (e.g. RMSE) using ``training set{''}
   is very similar to the performance using the ``test set{''}. NNAR model
   has an RMSE of 76.09 and 76.33 for the training set and test set,
   respectively, outperforming ARIMA and SARIMA.
   A much better NNAR model was found. However, this study found that the

Abstract = {Rainfall in India has very high temporal and spatial variability. The
   rainfall variability affects the livelihood and food habits of people
   from different regions. In this study, the rainfall trends in two
   stations in the northeastern state of Tripura, namely Agartala and
   Kailashahar have been studied for the period 1955-2017. The state
   experiences an annual mean of more than 2000 mm of rainfall, out of
   which, about 60\% occurs during the monsoon season and about 30\% in
   pre-monsoon. An attempt has been made to analyze the trends in seasonal
   and annual rainfall, rainy days and heavy rainfall in the two stations,
   during the same period.Non-parametric Mann-Kendall test has been used to
   find out the significance of these trends. Both increasing and
   decreasing trends are observed over the two stations. Increasing trends
   in rainfall, rainy days and heavy rainfall are found at Agartala during
   pre-monsoon season and decreasing trends in all other seasons and at
   annual scale. At Kailashahar, rainfall amount (rainy days \& heavy
   rainfall) is found to be increasing during pre-monsoon and monsoon
   seasons (pre-monsoon season). At annual scale also, rainfall and rainy
   days show increasing trends at Kailashahar. The parameters are showing
   decreasing trends during all other seasons at the station. Rainy days
   over Agartala show a significantly decreasing trend in monsoon, whereas
   no other trend is found to be significant over both the stations.},

Title = {Extreme index trends of daily gridded rainfall dataset (1960-2017) in

Abstract = {Previous lectures have shown that to effectively explore Taiwan's
   climate change or other relevant topics, long-term and stable
   observation datasets are required. We introduce the high-resolution
   grided precipitation dataset (TCCIP\_PR), which was constructed by the
   Taiwan Climate Change projection and adaptation Information Platform
   (TCCIP) program from thousands of station records. Although, a high
   spatial-time relationship exists between the TCCIP\_PR and the stations,
   a large uncertainty occurs over the complex terrain on the southwest
   windward side during the summer, due to sparse stations. To better
   understand the change in the extreme rainfall trends, we analyze 9
   suitable indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and
   Indices (ETCCDI). Our result show that the extreme rainfall intensity
   and frequency have continuously increased for a long time, and the
   consecutive dry days have decreased in recent decades, particularly over
   southwest Taiwan. The regime change evaluations agree that the
   precipitation characteristics were amplified and become more
   unpredictable from the early (1960-2002) to the late (2003-2017) period.
   For future applications or research, the calculated results of the
   extreme indices can be found in the printed documentation and the online
   retrieval system.},

Title = {Role of the Bay of Bengal warming in the Indian summer monsoon rainfall
   trend},

Abstract = {The Bay of Bengal (BoB) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are found to be
   negatively correlated with the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall at
   seasonal, monthly and daily time scales. It is intriguing that the ISM
   seasonal mean rainfall is reported to be decreasing in the recent
   decades while no prominent warming has been observed over the BoB. We
   posit that the reason why BoB warming is not apparent is because BoB
   surface waters stay largely above the convective threshold of similar to
   28 degrees C and further warming may be perceivable only in terms of an
   atmospheric response. This is consistent with prominent increase in the
   latent heat flux (LHF) over BoB during the pre-monsoon season. However
   such an increasing trend in LHF is not seen for the monsoon season. The
   increased surface evaporation leading to an increase in LHF over BoB
   enhances convection aloft which drives a stronger low level pre-monsoon
   circulation. We hypothesize that the dynamic response of the atmosphere
   associated with the pre-monsoon circulation changes driven by the BoB
   warming can explain, at least in part, the observed ISM rainfall trend.
   This hypothesis is tested by diagnosing SST-forced simulations with the
   Community Atmosphere Model version 6. The results suggest that the BoB
   warming does generate dynamic and thermodynamic responses which enhance
   moisture convergence (divergence) and convection over BoB (central
   India) during the pre-monsoon season. As a consequence,
   evapotranspiration is enhanced over the Indian subcontinent leaving the
   ground drier and colder. The net result is a weaker land-ocean thermal
   contrast and a weaker monsoon circulation and hence reduced seasonal
   rainfall totals.},

Title = {Trends of Rainfall Onset, Cessation, and Length of Growing Season in

Abstract = {Rainfall onset and cessation date greatly influence cropping calendar
   decisions in rain-fed agricultural systems. This paper examined trends
   of onsets, cessation, and the length of growing season over Northern
   Ghana using CHIRPS-v2, gauge, and farmers' perceptions data between 1981
   and 2019. Results from CHIRPS-v2 revealed that the three seasonal
   rainfall indices have substantial latitudinal variability. Significant
   late and early onsets were observed at the West and East of 1.5 degrees
   W longitude, respectively. Significant late cessations and longer
   growing periods occurred across Northern Ghana. The ability of farmers'
   perceptions and CHIRPS-v2 to capture rainfall onsets are time and
   location-dependent. A total of 71\% of farmers rely on traditional
   knowledge to forecast rainfall onsets. Adaptation measures applied were
   not always consistent with the rainfall seasonality. More investment in
   modern climate information services is required to complement the
   existing local knowledge of forecasting rainfall seasonality.},

Title = {Trend of annual maximum rainfall in Campania region (Southern Italy)},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Extreme rainfall events are increasing in both number and intensity at
   global scale; however, it is hard to quantify the impact of climate
   change at local scale given the strong temporal and spatial
   heterogeneity of this process. Moreover, limited data availability and
   its spatial variability requires significant effort to identify specific
   trends at the regional level. In this study, we attempt to construct a
   detailed description of rainfall patterns and trends over the Campania
   region, southern Italy. For this reason, the dataset of rainfall annual
   maxima in pre-assigned durations was constructed using all available
   records and extended using interpolation methods such as inverse
   distance weighting and ordinary kriging methods. The rainfall dataset
   allowed actual trends over the region to be quantified using the
   Mann-Kendall trend test and the record-breaking analysis. The trend test
   reveals that most of the rainfall stations display no statistically
   significant trend, however, an increasing trend of extreme rainfall for
   short durations, in specific portions of the region, is observed.},

Title = {Changes in rainfall seasonality inferred from weathering and pedogenic
   trends in mid-Miocene paleosols of La Tatacoa, Colombia},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The authigenic clay mineral assemblage of paleosol profiles and trends
   in their bulk geochemical evolution provide insight into the intensity
   of past chemical weathering regimes. These climate-sensitive weathering
   products can be used to interpret regional changes of the soil moisture
   regime, which in turn reflects upon the nature of rainfall seasonality
   (e.g., unimodal vs. bimodal). A conspicuous color change in the overbank
   deposits and paleosols of the mid-Miocene Honda Group of La Tatacoa,
   Colombia, is suggestive of a climatic transition which affected the
   fauna of La Venta - a mid-Miocene fossiliferous site and significant
   component of the South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA) classification.
   This study aims to determine how the paleopedology of this region
   records the climatic transition that modified the annual patterns of
   rainfall and soil moisture, forcing a change from the gray-colored
   paleosols hosted by the La Victoria Formation (-13.6 to -13.1 Myr) to
   the redbeds of the Villavieja Formation (-13.1 to 12.0 Myr). In the La
   Victoria profile, the pedogenic fraction of the clay assemblage
   indicates that vermiculite, chlorite/HIV mixed-layered clays and high
   concentrations of base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+) developed in a poorly
   drained paleosol under reducing (low Eh) and above-neutral pH
   conditions. By contrast, the presence of kaolinite, goethite and
   hematite in the red-beds paleosols implies more oxidizing conditions
   (high Eh), whereas pedogenic vermiculite and smectite suggest a pH close
   to or mildly below neutral. A common detrital source (parent material)
   is inferred for both sets of paleosols. However, more intense chemical
   weathering towards aluminium rich clay in the Villavieja red-bed fossil
   soils indicates a change in soil humidity from a poorly drained soil
   environment of a seasonally flooded wetland system to an alternating
   regime of humidity and drought on a better drained floodplain. The
   variation in soil moisture is consistent with a change in seasonality
   from a unimodal rainfall regime in the case of the La Victoria paleosols
   to bimodal conditions in the case of the paleosols of the Villavieja Fm.
   After the establishment of a fully glaciated Antarctica and the global
   climate transition into the Mi-4 glacial stage at -13.1 Ma, an increased
   rate of continental weathering along the paleotropical fringe could have
   been caused by a stronger temperature gradient between the equator and
   South Pole, shifting the Intertropical Convergence Zone northward and
   the rainfall patterns with it.},
