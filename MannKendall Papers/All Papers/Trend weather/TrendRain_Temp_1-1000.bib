Abstract = {Because of its low topographic relief, unique hydrology, and the large
   interannual variability of precipitation, Florida is especially
   vulnerable to climate change. In this paper, we investigate a
   comprehensive collection of climate metrics to study historical trends
   in both averages and extremes of precipitation and temperature in the
   state. The data investigated consist of long-term records (1892-2008) of
   precipitation and raw (unadjusted) temperature at 32 stations
   distributed throughout the state. To evaluate trends in climate metrics,
   we use an iterative pre-whitening method, which aims to separate
   positive autocorrelation from trend present in time series. Results show
   a general decrease in wet season precipitation, most evident for the
   month of May and possibly tied to a delayed onset of the wet season. In
   contrast, there seems to be an increase in the number of wet days during
   the dry season, especially during November through January. We found
   that the number of dog days (above 26.7 degrees C) during the year and
   during the wet season has increased at many locations. For the post-1950
   period, a widespread decrease in the daily temperature range (DTR) is
   observed mainly because of increased daily minimum temperature (Tmin).
   Although we did not attempt to formally attribute these trends to
   natural versus anthropogenic causes, we find that the urban heat island
   effect is at least partially responsible for the increase in Tmin and
   its corresponding decrease in DTR at urbanized stations compared with
   nearby rural stations. In the future, a formal trend attribution study
   should be conducted for the region. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {Annual, seasonal, and monthly trends in precipitation, mean temperature,
   maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and temperature range were
   evaluated using stations from the United States Historical Climatology
   Network (USHCN) for the time periods 1895-2009 and 1970-2009 for the
   state of Florida. The significance and magnitude of station trends were
   determined using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope,
   respectively. The collective, field significance of trends were
   evaluated using a Monte Carlo permutation procedure. Field significant
   trends in seasonal precipitation were found in only the June-August and
   March-May seasons for the 1895-2009 and 1970-2009 time periods,
   respectively. Significant decreasing trends in monthly precipitation
   were found in the months of October and May for the 1895-2009 and
   1970-2009 time periods, respectively. Field significant trends were
   found for all temperature variables for both time periods, with the
   largest number of stations with significant trends occurring in the
   summer and autumn months. Trends in mean, maximum, and minimum
   temperature were generally positive with a higher proportion of positive
   trends in the 1970-2009 period. The spatial coherence of trends in
   temperature range was generally less compared to other temperature
   variables, with a larger proportion of stations showing negative trends
   in the summer and positive trends at other times of the year and more
   negative trends found in the 1970-2009 period. Significant differences
   in temperature trends based on the surrounding land use were found for
   minimum temperature and temperature range in the 1970-2009 period
   indicating that data homogenization of the USHCN temperature data did
   not fully remove this influence. The evaluation of trends based on
   station exposure ratings show significant differences in temperature
   variables in both the 1895-2009 and 1970-2009 time periods. Systematic
   changes in trends can be seen in the 1980s, the period of widespread
   conversion from liquid-in-glass to electronic measurement, indicating
   that some of the differences found may be due to uncorrected
   inhomogeneities. Since notable differences were found between
   differently rated stations pre-1940, a time which the present-day rating
   should have little to no influence, attribution of differences based on
   station rating should be done with caution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Changes in frequency and intensity of weather events often result in
   more frequent and intensive disasters such as flash floods and
   persistent droughts. In Oman, changes in precipitation and temperature
   have already been detected, although a comprehensive analysis to
   determine long-term trends is yet to be conducted. We analysed daily
   precipitation and temperature records in Muscat, the capital city of
   Oman, mainly focusing on extremes. A set of climate indices, defined in
   the RClimDex software package, were derived from the longest available
   daily series (precipitation over the period 1977-2011 and temperature
   over the period 1986-2011). Results showed significant changes in
   temperature extremes associated with cooling. Annual maximum value of
   daily maximum temperature (TX), on average, decreased by 1 degrees C
   (0.42 degrees C/10 year). Similarly, the annual minimum value of daily
   minimum temperature (TN) decreased by 1.5 degrees C (0.61 degrees C/10
   year), which, on average, cooled at a faster rate than the maximum
   temperature. Consequently, the annual count of days when TX > 45 degrees
   C (98th percentile) decreased from 8 to 3, by 5 days. Similarly, the
   annual count of days when TN < 15 degrees C (2nd percentile) increased
   from 5 to 15, by 10 days. Annual total precipitation averaged over the
   period 1977-2011 is 81 mm, which shows a tendency toward wetter
   conditions with a 6 mm/10 year rate. There is also a significant
   tendency for stronger precipitation extremes according to many indices.
   The contribution from very wet days to the annual precipitation totals
   steadily increases with significance at 75\% level. When The General
   Extreme Value (GEV) probability distribution is fitted to annual maximum
   1-day precipitation, the return level of a 10-year return period in
   1995-2011 was estimated to be 95 mm This return level in the recent
   decade is about 70\% higher than the return level for the period of
   1977-1994. These results indicate that the long-term wetting signal
   apparent in total precipitation can be attributed largely to the
   increases in extreme precipitation in recent decades.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},

Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Temperature and precipitation covary across timescales due to
   thermodynamic and dynamic processes. We examine spatial patterns and
   trends of daily precipitation dependence of maximum and minimum
   temperature anomalies across the contiguous United States during
   1950-2020. In the warm season, maximum temperatures are anomalously cool
   on wet days, while in the cool season, minimum temperatures are
   anomalously warm on wet days. During 1950-2020, warm-season maximum
   temperatures increased 0.5 degrees C more on wet days than on dry days,
   whereas minimum temperature on dry days warmed slightly more than on wet
   days in both the warm and cool season. By contrast, climate models show
   more subtle and consistent precipitation dependence of temperature
   trends with approximately 0.2 degrees C more warming on dry days than on
   wet days. Improved understanding of precipitation-dependent temperature
   trends is critical for understanding and modeling the impacts of
   changing climate on snowpack, drought, and heat stress.},

Abstract = {To examine changes in the wintertime seasonal (December, January and
   February) temperature and precipitation over the Siachen Glacier, one of
   the largest glaciers outside the polar region, an analysis of its
   temperature and precipitation indices is planned. In the present study,
   temperature and precipitation indices over a period of 23 years
   (1984-2006) at six stations are computed after stringent quality control
   checks. Various indices are analysed at these stations representing
   glacier accumulation, transition and ablation zone. Results show rate of
   increase in number of warm days at A3 (station in accumulation zone) and
   Al (station in ablation zone) though slower at A3 than at Al. Further
   warm nights show significant decrease, cold days show increasing trends
   whereas cold nights show significant increase at A3. In case of ablation
   zone (Al), these indices show reverse trend. In case of precipitation,
   numbers of consecutive dry (wet) days have decreased (increased) in the
   Al and reverse is observed at A2 and A3 (stations in transition and
   accumulation zones respectively). Based on the regional temperature and
   precipitation changes, it is hypothesized that the transition zone
   between the accumulation and ablation zones fluctuates and moves towards
   the accumulation zone thereby extending the ablation zone and shrinking
   the accumulation zone. As a result, properties of the accumulation zone
   slowly get converted into those of the ablation zone.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2007},

Month = {OCT 27},
Abstract = {The contiguous United States has experienced both warming temperatures
   and a general increase in precipitation during the period 1950 - 2006.
   During that time drought has been a recurring phenomenon with a number
   of large droughts occurring, starting with the major drought in the
   1950s in the Central United States and culminating with the persistent
   drought in the western portion of the country that started in the late
   1990s. Here we examine the influence of the multi- decadal warming trend
   on drought coverage and the possibility that the general increase in
   regional and contiguous U. S. precipitation since about 1980 has masked
   the tendency for increasing drought driven largely by increasing
   temperature. Results indicate that without the increase in
   precipitation, severe to extreme drought would have affected as much as
   50\% more of the U. S. during some months in the most recent drought
   period.},

Abstract = {Temperature and precipitation changes over South Korea have been studied
   since 1954, both in terms of means and extreme events, using
   observational station data. Recurrence intervals are defined to examine
   trends in extreme events at each station. Generally, it is possible to
   describe trends in temperature and precipitation over South Korea as
   follows. The annual mean temperature shows an upward trend at a rate of
   0.23degreesC decade(-1) in the past four to five decades. There are some
   indications that climatic extremes have increased during recent decades.
   The diurnal temperature range increased in the later part of the time
   series (except for summer) as a result of a faster increase in maximum
   temperature than in minimum temperature. This is not consistent with the
   results reported elsewhere in the world. A wavelet analysis of
   wintertime temperatures indicates that the rapid warming in the recent
   decade may be associated with the warm phase of a decadal-interdecadal
   variation. The frequency of occurrence of extreme maximum temperature
   events shows an increasing trend, with higher values in the 1980s and
   1990s. The frequency of occurrence of extreme minimum temperature events
   shows the opposite, with a statistically significant decreasing trend.

   temperatures, diurnal temperature range, and total precipitation were
   analyzed for linear trends using least squares regressions. Annual and
   seasonal mean temperature increases were found throughout the entire
   state, and the majority were found to be statistically significant at
   the 95\% level or better. The highest increases were found in winter in
   the Interior region (2.2 degrees C) for the 50 year period of record.
   Decreases in annual and seasonal mean diurnal temperature range were
   also found, of which only about half were statistically significant. A
   state-wide decrease in annual mean diurnal temperature range was found
   to be 0.3 degrees C, with substantially higher decreases in the
   South/Southeastern region in winter.
   Increases were found in total precipitation for 3 of the 4 seasons
   throughout most of Alaska, while summer precipitation showed decreases
   at many stations. Few of the precipitation trends were found to be
   statistically significant, due to high interannual variability. Barrow,
   our only station in the Arctic region, shows statistically significant
   decreases in annual and winter total precipitation. These findings are
   largely in agreement with existing literature, although they do
   contradict some of the precipitation trends predicted by the
   CO2-doubling GCM's.},

Abstract = {This study is a part of a Nordic co-operative research project, Climate
   and Energy, funded by Nordic Energy Research and the Nordic energy
   sector. The project has the objective of a comprehensive assessment of
   the impact of climate change on Nordic renewable energy resources
   including hydropower, wind power, biofuels and solar energy. In this
   paper, the long term variability of precipitation, temperature and
   discharge of Icelandic rivers is analyzed with respect to trends. Trend
   is tested for two periods: 1941-2002, since the longest Icelandic
   discharge records reach 60 years back in time, and 1961-2000, so that a
   larger set of discharge records could be included, as only a few
   Icelandic discharge records extend more than 40 years back in time. An
   eventual trend in the time series is analyzed using the Mann-Kendall
   test. The test is applied to the time series of both annual and seasonal
   values, and also to the timing and volume of the maximum daily discharge
   in spring and autumn, respectively. The main conclusions from the study
   are that, despite significant increase in measured precipitation,
   discharge in non-glacial rivers has not increased. Meanwhile, spring
   temperatures have a negative trend and spring floods, therefore, are
   larger and delayed.},

Abstract = {Trends in Canadian temperature and precipitation during the 20th century
   are analyzed using recently updated and adjusted station data. Six
   elements, maximum, minimum and mean temperatures along with diurnal
   temperature range (DTR), precipitation totals and ratio of snowfall to
   total precipitation are investigated. Anomalies from the 1961-1990
   reference period were first obtained at individual stations, and were
   then used to generate gridded datasets for subsequent trend analyses.
   Trends were computed for 1900-1998 for southern Canada (south of 60
   degrees N), and separately for 1950-1998 for the entire country due to
   insufficient data in the high arctic prior to the 1950s.
   From 1900-1998, the annual mean temperature has increased between 0.5
   and 1.5 degrees C in the south. The warming is greater in minimum
   temperature than in maximum temperature in the first half of the century
   resulting in a decrease of DTR. The greatest warming occurred in the
   west, with statistically significant increases mostly seen during spying
   and summer periods. Annual precipitation has also increased from 5\% to
   35\% in southern Canada over the same period. In general, the ratio of
   snowfall to total precipitation has been increasing due mostly to the
   increase in winter precipitation which generally falls as snow and an
   increase of ratio in autumn. Negative trends were identified in some
   southern regions during spring. From 1950-1998, the pattern of
   temperature change is distinct: warming in the south and west and
   cooling in the northeast, with similar magnitudes in both maximum and
   minimum temperatures. This pattern is mostly evident in winter and
   spring. Across Canada, precipitation has increased by 5\% to 35\%, with
   significant negative trends found in southern regions during winter.
   Overall, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has increased with
   significant negative trends occurring mostly in southern Canada during
   spring.
   Indices of abnormal climate conditions are also examined. These indices
   were defined as areas of Canada for 1950-1998 or southern Canada for
   1900-1998 with temperature or precipitation anomalies above the 66th or
   below the 34th percentiles in their relevant time series. These
   confirmed the above findings and showed that climate has been becoming
   gradually wetter and warmer in southern Canada throughout the entire
   century, and in all of Canada during the latter half of the century.},

Abstract = {In this contribution we summarize results on the large-scale influence
   of the atmospheric circulation at several tropospheric levels and
   Mediterranean SSTs on wet season precipitation and warm season
   temperature across the Mediterranean area covering the last few decades.
   Three large-scale predictor fields (300 hPa geopotential height,
   700-1000 hPa thickness and SSTs) account for more than 50\% of the total
   summer temperature variability over the Mediterranean area. The positive
   phase of the first most important canonical mode is associated with
   blocking conditions, subsidence and stability related to warm
   Mediterranean summers. The second CCA mode shows an east-west dipole of
   the Mediterranean summer air temperature connected by a combination of a
   trough as well as an extended ridge over the western and eastern parts
   of the Mediterranean, respectively. It is mainly the first mode which is
   responsible for the significant 0.4 degrees C warming over the last 50
   years of the twentieth century. In the context of the last 500 years it
   comes apparent that the hot summers of the decade 1994-2003 seem to be
   unprecedented. The hottest larger Mediterranean summer over the last
   half millennium was in 2003, in agreement with findings from the whole
   of Europe. It is found that around 30\% of the total Mediterranean
   October to March precipitation variability can be accounted for by the
   combination of four large-scale geopotential height fields and sea level
   pressure. Results show that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) seems
   to play an important role in inter annual to centennial low frequency
   variability of wet season precipitation over the studied area. In the
   western and northern part, the correlation between precipitation and the
   NAO is negative, whereas for the southeastern part mostly positive
   correlations have been found. The analysis further reveals that since
   the mid-nineteenth century precipitation steadily increased with a
   maximum in the 1960s and decreased since then. The second half of the
   twentieth century shows a general downward trend of 2.2 mm/month/decade},

Abstract = {Daily temperature and precipitation data from 136 stations of Southwest
   China (SWC) during the last five decades, from 1960 to 2007, were
   analysed to determine the spatial and temporal trends by using the
   Mann-Kendall trend test. Results show that SWC has become warmer over
   the last five decades, especially in the recent 20-25 years. The
   increasing trends in winter months are more significant than those in
   the months of other seasons, and spatially Tibet, Hengduan mountains
   area and west Sichuan Plateau have larger temperature trend in magnitude
   than the other regions have. A downward trend was detected in Sichuan
   Basin also, but the region with cooler temperature was shrinking due to
   the statistically significant increasing trend of temperature after
   1990s. Both annual and seasonal means of daily maximum and minimum
   temperatures show an increasing trend, but trend magnitude of minimum
   temperature was larger than that of maximum temperature, resulting in
   the decrease of diurnal temperature range for SWC in the last 50 years.
   Annual precipitation showed slightly and statistically insignificant
   increasing trend, but statistically significant increasing trend has
   been detected in winter season while autumn witnessed a statistically
   significant decreasing trend. The results could be a reference for the
   planning and management of water resources under climate change.

Abstract = {This study considers long-term precipitation and temperature variability
   across the Caribbean using two gridded data sets (CRU TS 3.21 and
   GPCCv5). We look at trends across four different regions (Northern,
   Eastern, Southern and Western), for three different seasons (May to
   July, August to October and November to April) and for three different
   periods (1901-2012, 1951-2012 and 1979-2012). There are no century-long
   trends in precipitation in either data set, although all regions (with
   the exception of the Northern Caribbean) show decade-long periods of
   wetter or drier conditions. The most significant of these is for the
   Southern Caribbean region which was wetter than the 1961-1990 average
   from 1940 to 1956 and then drier from 1957 to 1965. Temperature in
   contrast shows statistically significant warming everywhere for the
   periods 1901-2012, 1951-2012 and for over half the area during
   1979-2012. Data availability is a limiting issue over much of the region
   and we also discuss the reliability of the series we use in the context
   of what is known to be available in the CRU TS 3.21 data set. More
   station data have been collected but have either not been fully
   digitized yet or not made freely available both within and beyond the

Abstract = {In this work, 45 years (1961-2005) of hourly meteorological data in
   Taiwan, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation, have been
   analyzed with emphasis on their diurnal asymmetries. A long-term
   decreasing trend for relative humidity (RH) is found, and the trend is
   significantly greater in the nighttime than in the daytime, apparently
   resulting from a greater warming at night. The warming at night in three
   large urban centers is large enough to impact the average temperature
   trend in Taiwan significantly between 1910 and 2005. There is a decrease
   in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) that is largest in major urban
   areas, and it becomes smaller but does not disappear in smaller cities
   and offshore islands. The nighttime reduction in RH is likely the main
   cause of a significant reduction of fog events over Taiwan. The smaller
   but consistent reductions in DTR and RH in the three off-coast islands
   suggests that, in addition to local land use changes, a regional-scale
   process such as the indirect effect of anthropogenic aerosols may also
   contribute to these trends. A reduction in light precipitation (<4 mm

Abstract = {Climate change has emerged as an important issue ever to confront
   mankind. This concern emerges from the fact that our day-to-day
   activities are leading to impacts on the Earth's atmosphere that has the
   potential to significantly alter the planet's shield and radiation
   balance. Developing countries particularly whose income is particularly
   derived from agricultural activities are at the forefront of bearing
   repercussions due to changing climate. The present study is an effort to
   analyze the changing trends of precipitation and temperature variables
   in Kashmir valley along different elevation zones in the north western
   part of India. As the Kashmir valley has a rich repository of glaciers
   with its annual share of precipitation, slight change in the temperature
   and precipitation regime has far reaching environmental and economic
   consequences. The results from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
   data of the period 1980-2014 reveals that the annual mean temperature of
   Kashmir valley has increased significantly. Accelerated warming has been
   observed during 1980-2014, with intense warming in the recent years
   (2001-2014). During the period 1980-2014, steeper increase, in annual
   mean maximum temperature than annual mean minimum temperature, has been
   observed. In addition, mean maximum temperature in plain regions has
   shown higher rate of increase when compared with mountainous areas. In
   case of mean minimum temperature, mountainous regions have shown higher
   rate of increase. Analysis of precipitation data for the same period
   shows a decreasing trend with mountainous regions having the highest
   rate of decrease which can be quite hazardous for the fragile mountain
   environment of the Kashmir valley housing a large number of glaciers.},

   observed global temperature increase and changed precipitation regimes.
   This study aims at detecting the most recent trends in monthly
   temperature and precipitation in Europe, and if possible, attributing
   these trends to changes in the frequency of circulation types. Building
   on previous work that covered only parts of Europe, this study covers
   all of Europe, using the Watch Forcing Data Interim re-analysis data
   (1979-2009). The SynopVis Grosswetterlagen (SVG) is used to define
   circulation types. The study shows that temperature trends in February
   can be attributed to changes in circulation, but in all other months,
   circulation changes cannot explain the trends. For precipitation the
   picture is unclear.},

Abstract = {The possibility of climate change in the Korean Peninsula has been
   examined in view of the general increase in greenhouse gases. Analyses
   include changes in annual temperature and precipitation. These analyses
   are supplemented with our observations regarding the apparent decrease
   of forest areas.
   It was found that there was a 0.96 degreesC (0.42 degreesC per decade)
   increase in annual mean temperature between 1974 and 1997. The increase
   in large cities was 1.5 degreesC but only 0.58 degreesC at rural and
   marine stations. The difference in the mean temperature between large
   cities and rural stations was small from 1974 to 1981. However, the
   difference increased from 1982 to 1997. In particular, the warming
   appears most significant in winter. Prior to 1982, the lowest
   temperatures were often -18 degreesC in central Korea, and since then
   the lowest temperatures have been only -12 similar to -14 degreesC.
   Recently, the minimum January temperature has increased at a rate of 1.5
   degreesC per decade. It is estimated that the increase of 1 degreesC in
   annual mean temperature corresponds to about a 250 km northward shift of
   the subtropical zone boundary.
   The analysis of data from 1906 to 1997 indicates a trend of increasing
   annual precipitation, an increase of 182 mm during the 92-year peirod,
   with large year-to-year variations. More than half of the annual mean
   amount, 1,274 mm, occurred from June to September.
   Meteorological data and satellite observations suggest that changes have
   occurred in the characteristics of the quasistationary fronts that
   produce summer rain. In recent years scattered local heavy showers
   usually occur with an inactive showery front, in comparison with the
   classical steady rain for more than three weeks. For instance, local
   heavy rainfall, on 6 August 1998 was in the range of 123-481 mm. The
   scattered, convective storms resulted in flooding with a heavy toll of
   approx. 500 people. The northward shift of the inactive showery front
   over Korea, and of a convergence zone in central China, correlate with
   the increase in temperature. It has been suggested that the decrease in
   forest areas and the change in ground cover also contribute to the
   warming of the Korean Peninsula.},

Abstract = {in the study of the climate change, probably related to the anthropic
   enhancement of greenhouse effect, an important topic is represented by
   the reconstruction of past climate, because the study of the past
   variations can help in understanding the present day trends. In this
   regard a prominent role is due to the analysis of long term data series,
   that can give quantitative information about climate change, going back
   from now to XVIII century. In a preceding paper, the investigation on
   the main climatic parameters in the period 1951-1995 in the
   Central-Western Mediterranean basin indicates a noticeable climatic
   evolution. In the present work we have examined only the Italian
   territory, where are available secular series of temperature and
   precipitation relative to about 50 years. The obtained results generally
   indicate a temperature increase and a rainfall reduction. In addition we
   have started to reconstruct some long-term data sets (Venezia, Taranto,
   Foggia, Catania), for the development of a data base of secular series.},

Abstract = {In this contribution we summarize results on the large-scale influence
   of the atmospheric circulation at several tropospheric levels and
   Mediterranean SSTs on wet season precipitation and warm season
   temperature across the Mediterranean area covering the last few decades.
   Three large-scale predictor fields (300 hPa geopotential height,
   700-1000 hPa thickness and SSTs) account, for more than 50\% of the
   total summer temperature variability over the Mediterranean area. The
   positive phase of the first most important canonical mode is associated
   with blocking conditions, subsidence and stability related to warm
   Mediterranean summers., The second CCA mode shows an cast-west dipole of
   the Mediterranean summer air temperature connected by a combination of a
   trough as well as an extended ridge over the western and eastern parts
   of the Mediterranean, respectively. It is mainly the first mode which is
   responsible for the significant 0.4 degrees C warming over the last 50
   years of the twentieth century. In the context of the last 500 years it
   comes apparent that the hot summers of the decade 1994-2003 seem to be
   unprecedented. The hottest larger Mediterranean summer over the last
   half millennium was in 2003, in agreement with findings from the whole
   of Europe. It is found that around 30\% of the total Mediterranean
   October to March precipitation variability can be accounted for by the
   combination of four large-scale geopotential height fields and sea level
   pressure. Results show that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) seems
   to play an important role in interannual to centennial low frequency
   variability of wet season precipitation over the studied area. In the
   western and northern part, the correlation between precipitation and the
   NAO is negative, whereas for the southeastern part mostly positive
   correlations have been found. The analysis further reveals that since
   the mid-nineteenth century precipitation steadily increased with a
   maximum in the 1960s and decreased since then. The second half of the
   twentieth century shows a general downward trend of 2.2 mm/month/decade.},

Abstract = {This study analyses spatial and temporal trends of precipitation and
   temperatures over Abruzzo Region (central Italy), using historical
   climatic data from a dense observation network. The results show a
   general, although not significant, negative trend in the regionally
   averaged annual precipitation (-1.8\% of the yearly mean rainfall per
   decade). This reduction is particularly evident in winter, especially at
   mountain stations (average -3\% change/decade). Despite this general
   decreasing trend, a partial rainfall recovery is observed after the
   1980s. Furthermore, the majority of meteorological stations register a
   significant warming over the last 60years, (mean annual temperature
   increase of +0.15 degrees C/decade), which reflects a rise in both
   minimum and maximum temperatures, with the latter generally increasing
   at a faster rate. Spring and summer are the seasons which contribute
   most to the general temperature increase, in particular at high
   elevation sites, which exhibit a more pronounced warming (+0.24 degrees
   C/decade). However, this tendency has not been uniform over 1951-2012,
   but it has been characterised by a cooling phenomenon in the first
   30years (1951-1981), followed by an even stronger warming during the
   last three decades (1982-2012). Finally, correlations between the
   climatic variables and the dominant teleconnection patterns in the
   Mediterranean basin are analysed to identify the potential influence of
   large-scale atmospheric dynamics on observed trends in Abruzzo. The
   results highlight the dominant role of the East-Atlantic pattern on
   seasonal temperatures, while more spatially heterogeneous associations,
   depending on the complex topography of the region, are identified
   between winter precipitation and the North Atlantic Oscillation,
   East-Atlantic and East-Atlantic/Western Russian patterns.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a prevalent issue all around the world. Changes in the
   temperature and precipitation, as well as their distributions, are the
   evidence of climate change. Therefore, the objective of this study was
   to gather and standardize information about temperature (maximum and
   minimum temperatures and the discrepancy between them) and precipitation
   in Iran's environmental zones. The long-term meteorological dataset was
   gathered from 47 synoptic stations for 66 years (1951-2017). Linear
   regression was employed to show the type and trend of changes in the
   studied variables. The Koppen method and UNESCO aridity index were
   adopted for climate classification based on temperature and
   precipitation criteria, respectively. Based on the Koppen method, the
   climate of Iran is defined into 4 environmental zones consisting of the
   arid desert (Bw), semi-arid (Bs), humid with mild winters (C), and humid
   with severe winters (D). On the basis of the UNESCO aridity index, the
   climate of Iran is classified into 5 environmental zones including very
   dry, dry, semi-dry, humid, and very humid. Results demonstrated that at
   42 stations (89\% of stations), the slope of the trend line was positive
   and long-term annual average temperatures of 5 stations (11\% of
   stations) were negative. Furthermore, for precipitation, 11 stations
   (25\% of stations) had positive trend and 33 stations had a negative
   trend (75\% of stations). Finally, it was found that there are
   significant changes in both temperature and precipitation. On the other
   hand, an overall increasing trend in temperature and a decreasing trend
   in precipitation were observed from high-altitude or high-latitude cold
   areas to low-latitude regions such as costal lines in Iran.},

Abstract = {Annual changes to climate extreme indices in Georgia (Southern Caucasus)
   from 1971 to 2010 are studied using homogenized daily minimum and
   maximum temperature and precipitation series. Fourteen extreme
   temperature and 11 extreme precipitation indices are selected from the
   list of core climate extreme indices recommended by the World
   Meteorological Organization-Commission for Climatology (WMO-CCL) and the
   research project on Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) of
   the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Trends in the extreme
   indices are studied for 10 minimum and 11 maximum temperature and 24
   precipitation series for the period 1971-2010. Between 1971 and 2010
   most of the temperature extremes show significant warming trends. In
   2010 there are 13.3 fewer frost days than in 1971. Within the same time
   frame there are 13.6 more summer clays and 7.0 more tropical nights. A
   large number of stations show significant warming trends for monthly
   minimum and maximum temperature as well as for cold and warm clays and
   nights throughout the study area, whereas warm extremes and night-time
   based temperature indices show greater trends than cold extremes and
   daytime indices. Additionally, the warm spell duration indicator
   indicates a significant increase in the frequency of warm spells between
   1971 and 2010. Cold spells show an insignificant increase with low
   spatial coherence. Maximum 1-day and 5-day precipitation, the number of
   very heavy precipitation days, very wet and extremely wet days as well
   as the simple daily intensity index all show an increase in Georgia,
   although all trends manifest a low spatial coherence. The contribution
   of very heavy and extremely heavy precipitation to total precipitation
   increased between 1971 and 2010, whereas the number of wet days
   decreases.(C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Abstract = {Snow is a vital resource for a host of natural and human systems. Global
   warming is projected to drive widespread decreases in snow accumulation
   by the end of the century, potentially affecting water, food, and energy
   supplies, seasonal heat extremes, and wildfire risk. However, over the
   next few decades, when the planning and implementation of current
   adaptation responses are most relevant, the snow response is more
   uncertain, largely because of uncertainty in regional and local
   precipitation trends. We use a large (40-member) single-model ensemble
   climate model experiment to examine the influence of precipitation
   variability on the direction and magnitude of near-term Northern
   Hemisphere snow trends. We find that near-term uncertainty in the sign
   of regional precipitation change does not cascade into uncertainty in
   the sign of regional snow accumulation change. Rather, temperature
   increases drive statistically robust consistency in the sign of future
   near-term snow accumulation trends, with all regions exhibiting
   reductions in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow, along with
   mean decreases in late-season snow accumulation. However, internal
   variability does create uncertainty in the magnitude of hemispheric and
   regional snow changes, including uncertainty as large as 33 \% of the
   baseline mean. In addition, within the 40-member ensemble, many
   mid-latitude grid points exhibit at least one realization with a
   statistically significant positive trend in net snow accumulation, and
   at least one realization with a statistically significant negative
   trend. These results suggest that the direction of near-term snow
   accumulation change is robust at the regional scale, but that internal
   variability can influence the magnitude and direction of snow
   accumulation changes at the local scale, even in areas that exhibit a
   high signal-to-noise ratio.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of annual temperature and precipitation time series data
   collected from three stations (Boutilimit (station 1), Nouakchott
   (station 2) and Rosso (station 3)) has been used to detect the impacts
   of climate change on water resources in Trarza region, Mauritania. The
   Mann-Kendall, the Spearman's rho, and the Sen trend test were used for
   the trend identification. Pettitt's test was used to detect the change
   point of the series while the Theil-Sen approach was used to estimate
   the magnitude of the slope in the series. For precipitation, two
   stations (1 and 3) indicated statistically significant increase in
   trends. In the case of temperature, almost all the stations show
   statistically significant increasing trends in the maximum, minimum, and
   average temperatures. The magnitude of precipitation detected by the
   Theil-Sen test for stations 1 and 3, respectively, was found to be at
   the rate of 2.93 and 3.35 mm/year at 5\% significance level. The
   magnitude trend of temperature detected by the Theil-Sen approach was
   found to be at the rate of 0.2-0.4 degrees C per decade for almost all
   the stations. The change points of temperature trends detected by
   Pettitt test are found to be in the same year (1995) for all the
   stations.},

Abstract = {Monthly precipitation and temperature data for Turkey were obtained from
   the Climate Research Unit Time Series (CRU TS V3.23) dataset (1901-2014)
   and analysed. The records of 81 grids, each located in a province, were
   converted into annual and seasonal data. The Mann-Kendall test was used
   to determine trend significance. The Theil-Sen slope estimator was used
   for estimating the magnitude of the trend. The Pettitt-Mann-Whitney test
   was used on the annual data series to identify the most probable change
   year' for precipitation and temperature. The spatial pattern of the
   trend was analysed using a geographical information system environment.
   The results showed that the annual areal precipitation over the whole of
   Turkey is not significantly increasing with a magnitude of 0.11 mm
   year(-1), but the annual areal temperature is increasing significantly
   with a magnitude of 0.88 degrees C century(-1). The grid analysis
   indicated that annual precipitation is decreasing in the southeastern
   Anatolia and Mediterranean regions and increasing in the Marmara and
   Black Sea regions, whilst other regions have no specific pattern.
   Although a trend is present in most of the grids, insignificance is
   dominant. Annual precipitation has no dominant change year with 1969
   being the most probable. Seasonal precipitation has increasing and
   decreasing trends in the same regions that also show such trends in
   annual precipitation. Annual temperature has a significant, increasing
   trend in all regions. 1993 was found as the most probable change year.
   Seasonal temperature showed an increasing trend in all regions. The
   highest increasing trend for temperature was found in the summer.},

Abstract = {A dataset of air temperature and precipitation time series (1959-2008)
   from 61 stations across Shanxi, China is used to analyze the climate
   change. The monotonic trends and step (abrupt) trends for annual and
   seasonal series data of mean air temperature and total precipitation are
   tested by using Mann-Kendall test and Mann-Whitney test, respectively.
   The results show that annual mean air temperature has increased by 1.20A
   degrees C during the past 50 years. Winter, spring, and autumn have
   experienced a significant increase in air temperature. The step trend
   for annual mean air temperature is different from, but closely related
   with, those for seasonal mean air temperature. Spatially, there is an
   enhanced warming trend from south to north in Shanxi, and the most
   remarkable warming occurs in northern Shanxi. Annual precipitation has
   decreased by 99.20 mm during the past half century. The decrease is
   mainly caused by precipitation decline in rainy season (June-September),
   though precipitation in post-rainy season (October-November) also tended
   to decrease. An abrupt decrease in precipitation has occurred since late
   1970s. Decrease in precipitation is highest in central Shanxi and in the
   area along the west fringe between Sanchuan River and Fenhe River in
   western Shanxi.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate variability has raised itself as a very
   challenging issue to the present generation. For assessing this, it is
   needed to quantify the climatic changes in terms of different
   hydro-meteorological parameters like rainfall and temperature, as they
   are the key factors responsible for drought-like or intense flooding
   situations. In this study, the temporal variability in precipitation and
   average temperature over a period of 102 years (1901-2002) has been
   investigated over Bilaspur District, Chhattisgarh, India. The
   statistical non-parametric Mann-Kendall test has been utilized to detect
   the monotonic trend whereas, Theil-Sen estimator test was applied to
   quantify the rate of change at monthly, seasonal (winter, pre-monsoon,
   monsoon, and post-monsoon), and annual scales. The results reveal for
   the precipitation trends to be increasing for most of the months and
   seasons, although they are not significant except for March, May, and
   pre-monsoon season. The annual rainfall over the district has increased
   by 10.65\% during the past 102 years. The average temperature was found
   to be significantly decreasing for monsoon season and increasing for
   non-monsoon seasons. The annual average temperature has increased by
   1.44\% from 1901 to 2002. This study will be helpful to the local
   stakeholders and policy makers to encompass the climatic variability
   aiding to effective decision making for proper water management.},

Abstract = {Changes in intensity and frequency of daily heavy precipitation and hot
   temperature extremes are analyzed in Swiss observations for the years
   1901-2014/2015. A spatial pooling of temperature and precipitation
   stations is applied to analyze the emergence of trends. Over 90\% of the
   series show increases in heavy precipitation intensity, expressed as
   annual maximum daily precipitation (mean change: +10.4\% 100years(-1);
   31\% significant, p<0.05) and in heavy precipitation frequency,
   expressed as the number of events greater than the 99th percentile of
   daily precipitation (mean change: +26.5\% 100years(-1); 35\%
   significant, p<0.05). The intensity of heavy precipitation increases on
   average by 7.7\%K-1 smoothed Swiss annual mean temperature, a value
   close to the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling. The hottest day and week of the
   year have warmed by 1.6K to 2.3K depending on the region, while the
   Swiss annual mean temperature increased by 1.9K. The frequency of very
   hot days exceeding the 99th percentile of daily maximum temperature has
   more than tripled. Despite considerable local internal variability,
   increasing trends in heavy precipitation and hot temperature extremes
   are now found at most Swiss stations. The identified trends are unlikely
   to be random and are consistent with climate model projections, with
   theoretical understanding of a human-induced change in the energy budget
   and water cycle and with detection and attribution studies of extremes
   on larger scales.},

Abstract = {The characteristics of drought in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
   (Xinjiang), China have changed due to changes in the spatiotemporal
   patterns of temperature and precipitation, however, the effects of
   temperature and precipitation-the two most important factors influencing
   drought-have not yet been thoroughly explored in this region. In this
   study, we first calculated the standard precipitation evapotranspiration
   index (SPEI) in Xinjiang from 1980 to 2020 based on the monthly
   precipitation and monthly average temperature. Then the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of temperature, precipitation, and drought in Xinjiang
   from 1980 to 2020 were analyzed using the Theil-Sen median trend
   analysis method and Mann-Kendall test. A series of SPEI-based
   scenario-setting experiments by combining the observed and detrended
   climatic factors were utilized to quantify the effects of individual
   climatic factor (i.e., temperature and precipitation). The results
   revealed that both temperature and precipitation had experienced
   increasing trends at most meteorological stations in Xinjiang from 1980
   to 2020, especially the spring temperature and winter precipitation. Due
   to the influence of temperature, trends of intensifying drought have
   been observed at spring, summer, autumn, and annual scales. In addition,
   the drought trends in southern Xinjiang were more notable than those in
   northern Xinjiang. From 1980 to 2020, temperature trends exacerbated
   drought trends, but precipitation trends alleviated drought trends in
   Xinjiang. Most meteorological stations in Xinjiang exhibited
   temperature-dominated drought trend except in winter; in winter, most
   stations exhibited precipitation-dominated wetting trend. The findings
   of this study highlight the importance of the impact of temperature on
   drought in Xinjiang and deepen the understanding of the factors
   influencing drought.},

Abstract = {An informed decision on building climate resilience and adaptation
   requires a deep understanding of long-term changes in temperature and
   precipitation, especially for most vulnerable countries to climate
   extremes like Vietnam. Hence, this study aimed to comprehend
   spatiotemporal trend possibilities of temperature and precipitation in
   Vietnam by employing multiple non-parametric statistical trend tests.
   This study also suggested a modified procedure, represented as a
   Hovmoller-like diagram, for enhancing the characterization of long-term
   spatiotemporal trends by applying multiple monotonic trend tests to all
   latitude coordinates through all possible 30-year periods. The
   superiority of multiple trend tests over a single one is that this
   methodology can assess the sensitivity of trend test results to the
   beginning years, ending years, and record lengths, thus emphasizing the
   necessity of performing monotonic trend tests repeatedly. The results
   show consistent warming trends in all climate sub-regions over the last
   4-5 decades, with the estimated trend slopes varying from approximately
   0.010-0.042 degrees C/year. Precipitation anomalies in most climate
   sub-regions, especially in the southern part, experienced significant
   increasing trends at the rate of around 0.29-2.76\%/year during the last
   3-5 decades. These findings are expected to contribute more insights
   into the spatio-temporal trend patterns of temperature and precipitation

Abstract = {We studied the basic characteristics of temperature and precipitation in
   different climatic zones of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 1961-2005,
   through statistical and spatial analysis. Over the past 45 yr, annual
   temperature in the TP increased at a rate of 0.265 degrees C decade(-1).
   The rate of temperature increase in winter was double that of spring in
   almost all zones and the rate of annual temperature increase was
   demonstrably higher during 1980-2005 than during 1961-1980 and 19612005,
   suggesting that the rate of warming is accelerating. Annual
   precipitation showed a slight increase (8.21 mm decade(-1)) across the
   whole TP. Short (2 to 4 yr), middle (5 to 8 yr), and long (> 10 yr)
   precipitation cycles were found at 32, 11, and 6 stations, respectively.
   Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis revealed different
   precipitation cycles between the northern and the southern TP, with the
   boundary along 33 degrees N. For the period 1961-2005, 46 stations
   showed a warming-wetting trend; the number of stations showing this
   trend for 1980-2005 was 34\% higher than for 1961-1980, suggesting that
   a warming-wetting trend will dominate the TP in the future.},

Abstract = {Changes in climatic parameters are often given in terms of global
   averages even though large regional variability is generally observed.
   The study of regional tendencies provides not only supplementary
   conclusions to more large-scale oriented results but is also of
   particular interest to local policy-makers and resource managers to have
   detailed information regarding sensible and influential climatic
   parameters. In this study, changes in precipitation for the Balearic
   Islands (Spain) have been analyzed using data from 18 rain gauges with
   complete daily time series during the period 1951-2006 and two
   additional sites where only monthly totals were available. Tendencies
   for maximum and minimum 2-m temperatures have also been derived using
   data from three thermometric stations with daily time series for the
   period 1976-2006. The thermometric stations are located at the head of
   the runways in the airports of the three major islands of the
   archipelago, where urbanization has arguably not had a relevant impact
   on the registered values. The annual mean temperature in the
   mid-troposphere and lower stratosphere has also been analyzed using the
   Balearics radiosonde data for the period 1981-2006. Results show there
   is a negative tendency for annual precipitation (163 mm per century)
   with 85\% significance on the sign of the trend. An abrupt decrease in
   mean yearly precipitation of 65 mm is objectively detected in the time
   series around 1980. Additionally, the analysis shows that light and
   heavy daily precipitation (up to 4 mm and above 64 mm, respectively)
   increase their contribution to the total annual, while the share from
   moderate-heavy precipitations (16-32 mm) is decreasing. Regarding the
   thermometric records, minimum temperatures increased at a rate of 5.8A
   degrees C per century during the 31 years and maximum temperatures also
   increased at a rate of 5.0A degrees C per century, both having a level
   of statistical significance for the sign of the linear trend above 99\%.
   Temperatures in the mid-troposphere decreased at a rate of -aEuro parts
   per thousand 5.4A degrees C per century while a tendency of -aEuro parts
   per thousand 7.8A degrees C per century is found in the lower
   stratosphere. The level of statistical significance for the sign of both
   the tropospheric and stratospheric linear trends is above 98\% despite
   the great inter-annual variability of both series.},

Abstract = {A quality-controlled and enhanced database of 38 temperature and 52
   precipitation stations was developed for Slovenia, a transitional area
   between Mediterranean, Alpine and continental climatic regimes, covering
   the period 1951-2007. Mean annual temperatures significantly increased
   in nearly all of Slovenia (except western areas) at rates between 0.15
   and 0.36 A degrees C/decade. Warming was most intense strongest in
   summer and spring in north-eastern Slovenia (0.3-0.4 A degrees C/decade)
   and weakest in autumn. Precipitation trends were heterogeneous. Annual
   precipitation decreased significantly in the north-western part, at 3-6
   \% per decade. During spring and summer, decrease in rainfall by 3-6 \%
   was detected in western Slovenia. No significant trends were found for
   the autumn season. In winter, precipitation decreased, by 3-12 \% per
   decade, in particular in north-western Slovenia. As observed also
   elsewhere in Central Europe, changes in large-scale atmospheric
   circulation patterns may have contributed to the observed long-term
   warming and drying in Slovenia. However, the strong warming in summer
   and spring, that is almost twice the trend observed in neighbouring
   countries, could be enhanced by drier soils caused by the decrease in
   winter precipitation in Slovenia.},

Abstract = {Trends in temperature and precipitation extremes from 1961 to 2008 have
   been investigated over Circum-Bohai-Sea region, China using daily
   temperature and precipitation data of 63 meteorological stations. The
   results show that at most stations, there is a significant increase in
   the annual frequency of warm days and warm nights, as well as a
   significant decrease in the annual frequency of cold days, cold nights,
   frost days, and annual diurnal temperature range (DTR). Their regional
   averaged changes are 2.06 d/10yr, 3.95 d/10yr, -1.88 d/10yr, -4.27
   d/10yr, -4.21 d/10yr and -0.20A degrees C/10yr, respectively. Seasonal
   changes display similar patterns to the annual results, but there is a
   large seasonal difference. A significant warming trend is detected at
   both annual and seasonal scales, which is more contributed by changes of
   indices defined by daily minimum temperature than those defined by daily
   maximum temperature. For precipitation indices, the regional annual
   extreme precipitation displays a weak decrease in terms of magnitude and
   frequency, i.e. extreme precipitation days (RD95p), intensity (RINTEN),
   proportion (RPROP) and maximum consecutive wet days (CWD), but a slight
   increase in the maximum consecutive dry days (CDD), which are consistent
   with changes of annual total precipitation (PRCPTOT). Seasonally,
   PRCPTOT and RD95p both exhibit an increase in spring and a decrease in
   other seasons with the largest decrease in summer, but generally not
   significant. In summary, this study shows a pronounced warming tendency
   at the less rainy period over Circum-Bohai-Sea region, which may affect
   regional economic development and ecological protection to some extent.},

Abstract = {{[}1] Retrospective climate simulations using the Goddard Institute for
   Space Studies SI2000 global climate model were used to examine possible
   causes of the observed upward trend in the frequency of U. S. extreme
   precipitation events. Three experiments were performed for the period
   1951-1997, all with identical external radiative forcing but with
   different ocean treatments. One experiment used the ``Q flux'' ocean
   model. The second experiment imposed observed time-varying sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs). The third experiment imposed observed time-varying
   SSTs for the tropical Pacific only and imposed climatological SSTs
   elsewhere. The Q flux ocean experiment did not reproduce the observed
   upward trend. Both experiments using observed time-varying SSTs produced
   an upward trend qualitatively similar to the observed trend for 7-day
   duration events, although agreement was not as good for 1-day duration
   events. However, the experiment with time-varying SSTs only in the
   tropical Pacific was found to be overly sensitive to the increasing
   frequency of El Nino events. Changes in atmospheric water vapor content
   for the two imposed-SST experiments were consistent with what might be
   expected to accompany increases in extreme precipitation. These results
   suggest that the spatial and temporal variations of SSTs on a global
   scale may be one direct and proximate cause of the recent observed
   upward trend in U. S. extreme multiday-duration precipitation events.},

   warming trend was detected in eastern Canada and north-eastern USA.
   Instead, some cooling trends were found, particularly in October. The
   analysis on the annual cycle of temperature data also shows the seasonal
   and regional nature of warming and cooling trends. Unlike temperature,
   no obvious trend is found in the precipitation data, but on the whole
   there are more stations (up to 10 per cent) with upward trends (increase
   in precipitation) during springs and summers. A bivariate test was used
   to detect a shift in the mean of precipitation series with respect to
   maximum temperature series but no obvious indication of such a shift was

Abstract = {This article examines instrumental climate records from a variety of
   stations associated with the following Biosphere Reserves across Canada:
   (i) Waterton Lakes, (ii) Riding Mountain, (iii) Niagara Escarpment, (iv)
   Long Point, and (v) Kejimkujik (Candidate Biosphere Reserve). Annual
   series are generated from daily temperature and precipitation values. In
   addition, homogeneous data are used from other stations and regional
   records to supplement the records from the local biosphere stations.
   Long term trends are identified over the period of the instrumental
   record. In general, data from the interval 1900 to 1998 show cooler
   temperatures in the 1920's, warming from the early 1940's into the early
   1950's, cooling into the 1970's, and subsequent warming. At many
   stations, 1998 is the warmest in the instrumental record. Comparisons
   with the regional data sets show good agreements between the temperature
   series. The 20th century warming is approximately 1.0 degreesC in the
   Riding Mountain area and 0.6 degreesC in the Long Point, Niagara
   Escarpment, and Waterton Lakes areas. There has been slight cooling in
   the Kejimkujik area over the past half century. Precipitation data show
   increasing trends in the Kejimkujik, Long Point, Niagara Escarpment, and
   Waterton Lakes areas with no long term trend in the Riding Mountain
   area. This work is part of the Canadian Biosphere Reserves Association
   (CBRA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), designed to present climate
   change information to Biosphere Reserve communities to allow local
   organizations to understand climate change and adapt to potential

Abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau has one of the most complex climates in the world.
   Analysis of the climate in this region is important for understanding
   the climate change worldwide. In this study, climate patterns and trends
   in the Tibetan Plateau were analysed for the period from 1961 to 2001.
   Air temperature and precipitation were analysed on monthly and annual
   time scales using data collected from the National Meteorological
   Centre, China Meteorological Administration. Nonlinear slopes were
   estimated and analysed to investigate the spatial and temporal trends of
   air temperature and precipitation in the Tibetan Plateau using a
   Mann-Kendall method. Spatial analysis of air temperature and
   precipitation variability across the Tibetan Plateau was undertaken.
   While most trends are local in nature, there are general basinwide
   patterns. Temperature during the last several decades showed a long-term
   warmer trend, especially the areas around Dingri and Zogong stations,
   which formed two increasing centres. Only one of the stations
   investigated exhibited decreasing trend, and this was not significant.
   Precipitation in the Tibetan Plateau has increased in most regions of
   the study area over the past several decades, especially in the eastern
   and central part, while the western Tibetan Region exhibited a decreased
   trend over the same period. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Past (1950-2017) and future (-2100) temperature and precipitation trends
   in Egypt},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Egypt, located in the Middle East and North Africa region, is considered
   to be a potential hot-spot of climate change where the warming and
   increase of the frequency of extreme temperatures could occur faster
   than at global scale. Precipitation is also expected to decrease in the
   region. In this work, our aim is to quantify the past and future
   temperature and precipitation trends at 8 locations selected for being
   representative of the variety of Egyptian climates. For the past period
   (1950-2017), we show that the decadal temperature trends derived from
   the analysis of the assimilated ERA-Interim (ERA-Int) and downscaled
   CORDEX (Historical and Evaluation) data are consistent. Relative to
   1960, the daily maximal and minimal temperatures have increased by 1.3
   +/- 0.1 and 1.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C, respectively, at the 8 selected
   locations. However, at the shorter yearly time scale, sub-regional
   differences of climate variability can be evidenced: this variability is
   less at the coastal and Nile Delta sites than at the drier inland
   locations. For the future, we use an ensemble of 6 CORDEX Africa models.
   Under the RCP45 scenario, the temperatures are predicted to increase at
   a rate ranging from 0.28 +/- 0.04 degrees C/decade (Alexandria) to 0.38
   +/- 0.09 degrees C/decade (Hurghada and Aswan) between 2010 and 2040,
   and to abate afterwards (0.12 +/- 0.08 degrees C/decade). Under the
   RCP85 scenario, the rates of temperature increase before 2040 are
   similar to those under RCP45 (from 0.24 +/- 0.14 to 0.40 +/- 0.12
   degrees C/decade) but considerably larger afterwards (from 0.48 +/- 0.18
   degrees C to 0.72 +/- 0.11 degrees C/decade between 2050 and 2100). As
   compared to the 2006-2015 reference period, the extreme temperatures
   analysis performed with the CLIMDEX software shows that the hot days and
   nights will become more frequent at all sites, but that the increase
   will occur at larger rates at the Red Sea (Hurghada) and upper Egypt
   (Aswan) sites than at the other ones. These inter-site differences are
   more pronounced with RCP45 than with RCP85. Considering the latter
   scenario, in the last decade of this century about 80\% of the days in a
   year would be hotter than the 90th percentile of the 2006-2015 reference
   period. Regarding the annual precipitation, the analysis of ERA-Interim
   data of the 1980-2017 period does not reveal any significant trend, but
   in both RCP45 and RCP85 a significant decrease (from -0.48 to -0.9 mm/y,
   and from -0.95 to -1.40 mm/y, respectively) is predicted to occur from
   2010 to 2100 in the north of Egypt where rain is currently the most
   abundant.},

Title = {Attribution of European precipitation and temperature trends to changes
   in synoptic circulation},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7},
Pages = {3093-3107},
Abstract = {Surface climate in Europe is changing and patterns in trends have been
   found to vary at sub-seasonal scales. This study aims to contribute to a
   better understanding of these changes across space and time by analysing
   to what degree observed climatic trends can be attributed to changes in
   synoptic atmospheric circulation. The relative importance of synoptic
   circulation changes (i.e. trends in synoptic type frequencies) as
   opposed to trends in the hydrothermal properties of synoptic types
   (within-type trends) on precipitation and temperature trends in Europe
   is assessed on a monthly basis. The study is based on mapping spatial
   and temporal trend patterns and their variability at a relatively high
   resolution (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees; monthly) across Europe. Gridded
   precipitation and temperature data (1963-2001) originate from the Watch
   Forcing Data set and synoptic types are defined by the objective
   SynopVis Grosswetterlagen (SVG). During the study period, relatively
   high influence of synoptic circulation changes are found from January to
   March, contributing to wetting trends in northern Europe and drying in
   the south. Simultaneously, particularly dry synoptic types get warmer
   first in south-western Europe in November and/or December and affect
   most of Europe in March and/or April. Strong influence of synoptic
   circulation changes is again found in June and August. In general,
   changes in synoptic circulation has a stronger effect on climate trends
   in north-western Europe than in the south-east. The exact locations of
   the strongest influence of synoptic circulation changes vary with the
   time of year and to some degree between precipitation and temperature.
   Throughout the year and across the whole of Europe, precipitation and
   temperature trends are caused by a combination of synoptic circulation
   changes and within-type changes with their relative influence varying
   between regions, months and climate variables.},

Title = {Precipitation and temperature changes in eastern India by multiple trend
   detection methods},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {180},
Pages = {211-225},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The present study deals with spatial and temporal trend analysis of
   precipitation and temperature (1970-2004) in eastern India. Long-term
   trend direction and magnitude of change over time (annual and seasonal)
   were detected and analyzed by Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator,
   Least square linear regression, Spearman rank correlation and Sequential
   Mann-Kendall test. In addition to it, correlation analysis was also
   performed. Trend analysis of annual rainfall by different methods
   indicated similar annual trends in eastern India. North-eastern,
   south-eastern and western parts of eastern India indicated increasing
   trend, whereas the north-western, central and southern parts showed
   decreasing trend. A similar trend was observed by different methods in
   case of seasonal rainfall. During winter season, decreasing trend was
   observed in the central part, whereas similar results were obtained for
   pre-and post-monsoon in the western part. The trend during monsoon
   season was found similar to annual rainfall trend. Abrupt change in
   trend of rainfall with time was lacking in eastern India. Maximum
   temperature analysis indicated increasing trend in the western part for
   all the seasons (except in monsoon) and decreasing trend in the eastern
   part. On the contrary, increasing trend was observed in the eastern part
   and decreasing trend in the western half of the study area for all the
   seasons in case of minimum temperature. Significant changes were
   observed during monsoon season as compared to other seasons. A
   decreasing trend in mean temperature was observed in the central,
   southern and north western parts, whereas it was found to be increasing
   in the north-eastern, western and south-eastern parts. In majority of
   the eastern India region, any abrupt change of trend in temperatures
   with time was not clearly observed. Negative correlation between
   rainfall and maximum temperature was observed in the entire eastern
   India. Similar results were observed in case of minimum temperature
   (monsoon) and mean temperature (pre-monsoon and monsoon). (C) 2016

Abstract = {This paper presents results of analyses by parametric methods of annual
   means of temperature, precipitation and discharge, and of seasonal
   maximum precipitation at 17, 28 and 10 Icelandic stations, respectively,
   for the period 1961-2000. Trends in mean seasonal temperature and
   precipitation are in broad agreement with results found by other authors
   using other methods. A positive trend appears in both mean annual
   temperature and mean temperatures in most seasons. Annual mean
   precipitation trends are positive in most seasons except for negative
   trends in the September-November season in the south. Additionally,
   positive trends appear in maximum one-, three- and five-day
   precipitation, both during the spring and autumn, except at a group of
   stations in central Iceland. Some of the positive trends in mean annual
   and seasonal precipitation may, however, be attributed to the positive
   trend in temperature which may have influenced gauge catch. Trends in
   mean annual and seasonal discharge are small and statistically
   insignificant; the trends found in temperature and precipitation do not
   all relate directly to trends in discharge but suggest hypotheses for
   further study of the relationships between them.},

Title = {Observed Trends and Changes in Temperature and Precipitation Extreme
   Indices over Myanmar},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Projected increase in frequency and severity of extreme events are
   important threat brought by climate change. Thus, there is a need to
   understand the dynamics and magnitude of climate extreme at local and
   regional level. This study examines the patterns of annual trends and
   changes of extreme daily temperature and precipitation in Myanmar for
   the period of 1981 to 2015 using the RClimDex 1.1 software. The trends
   of maximum and minimum temperature show significant warming trends (p <
   0.001) across Myanmar. From 2009 to 2015, the maximum temperature
   anomaly has continuously increased by 0.5 degrees C for all years except
   2011. The larger rise in both maximum and minimum temperature observed
   after 2000 suggests that, overall, days and nights are becoming hotter
   for the entirety of Myanmar over this recent period. Furthermore, our
   works also show that the temperature extreme indices of warm days and
   warm nights have increased, whereas the frequency of cool days and cool
   nights have decreased. Our analysis also reveals that increasing trends
   in precipitation anomaly were not significant during 1981-2015. On the
   contrary, slight increasing trends towards wetter conditions were
   observed with a rate of 76.52 mm/decade during the study period. The
   other precipitation extreme indicatorsnamely, annual total precipitation
   (PRCPTOT), heavy precipitation days (R20mm), extreme wet days
   precipitation (R99p), and consecutive wet days (CWD)are consistent with
   warming trends. Additionally, the relationship between inter-annual
   variability in the climate extremes indices and Oceanic Nino Index (ONI)
   patterns was also examined with a focus on the influence of the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.},

Abstract = {In this study, we analysed the effects of non-linear temperature and
   precipitation trends on Loess Plateau droughts over the period of
   1961-2010. The most commonly used drought index, the Palmer Drought
   Severity Index (PDSI), was used to represent the drought conditions in
   the study region. We first calculated the Loess Plateau PDSI using
   monthly temperature and precipitation from 53 meteorological stations
   and then determined trends in the PDSI, temperature, and precipitation
   using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) time series
   analysis method. Because of the different change characteristics and
   trends, precipitation plays an important role in the interannual
   variation in the PDSI, while temperature drives the PDSI trend change.
   The differences between the observed PDSI and the calculated results
   using the detrended temperature and observed precipitation, the observed
   temperature and detrended precipitation, and the detrended temperature
   and precipitation indicate that impact of the precipitation trend on
   droughts is smaller than the impact of the temperature trend. The
   increase in the observed temperature and limited decrease in the
   precipitation tend to increase drought in the Loess Plateau. The Loess
   Plateau will become drier and warmer in the future under climate change.

Abstract = {Despite of increased frequency of extreme climate events including their
   significance in Nepal's socio-economy, climate studies have seldom
   considered extremes, and even fewer have considered them in combination
   with temperature and precipitation. This study aimed at examining the
   trend of climate variables in Gandaki Province, Nepal. Daily temperature
   and precipitation data of five stations between 1990 and 2020 were
   analyzed. Modified Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope methods were used to
   detect trend and magnitude. The Mann-Whitney-Pettitt test was used to
   detect abrupt changes, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used
   to find the correlation. The result showed an increasing trend and a
   significant abrupt change in the maximum temperature for all stations. A
   decreasing trend in the minimum temperature was observed in the
   Himalayas and the Hill region, whereas an increasing trend was seen in
   Siwalik and Terai regions. The Jomsom station, however, behaved
   differently by showing an increasing trend in precipitation and the
   number of rainy days. The majority of the temperature indices showed an
   increasing trend unlike precipitation indices, which showed a mixed
   result. The maximum 5-day precipitation and consecutive dry days showed
   a significant positive correlation with altitude. The results indicate
   an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme climate conditions
   in Gandaki Province.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the most recent trends in meteorological and
   hydrological variables, which include air temperature and precipitation
   (P), potential and actual (ET) evapotranspiration, surface runoff (RO),
   water recharge into the soil (R) and water loss from the soil (L). Most
   hydrological variables were calculated via Palmer's algorithm. For this
   purpose, two rank-based statistical tests (the Mann-Kendall (MK) and a
   change-point analysis (CPA) approach) and the basic linear
   regression-based model were applied on the weekly precipitation and
   temperature from 17 stations all over Greece, during 1961-2006. Only in
   winter, all variables except for R, which showed no clear signal,
   presented downward trends. The declining trends of P and L in spring and
   summer were counterbalanced by reductions in RO (and R in the case of
   summer) as opposed to increases in ET. In autumn, the declining
   tendencies of P and L were offset by RO reductions and R increases.
   Annually, the trends in water cycle components were analogous to that of
   spring, summer and autumn. The number of stations with statistically
   significant (at 95\%) trends greatly varied with season and
   meteorological/hydrological variable.},

Abstract = {A grid-by-grid counting of interdecadal trend turning (ITT) of annual
   mean surface air temperature ( SAT) and total precipitation at 67,359
   terrestrial grids in the period 1951-2002 is presented. An analysis of
   the last ITTs of SAT and total precipitation in the period, in the
   context of both occurrence time and linear trends after the breakpoint,
   indicates that a warming trend has become highly significant across most
   reagent of the world in the late 20th Century. Most terrestrial grids
   have recorded an ITT of total precipitation in either the 1970s or
   1980s, and 45.7\% of the terrestrial grids in the study have seen a
   decreasing trend in total annual precipitation after the breakpoint,
   with the remaining 54.3\% having experienced an increasing trend.
   Basically, global terrestrial regions have experienced either an
   increasingly warm and dry climate or an increasingly warm and wet
   climate. An analysis of ITT of regional mean SAT and total precipitation
   in 22 regions shows that the Northern American continent has become
   increasingly warm and dry after the last interdecadal breakpoint.
   Meanwhile, the African continent has become increasingly warm and wet,
   with both Europe and most of Asia having the same trend. Southern South
   America and the West of Australia have experienced an opposite trend in
   climate, becoming increasingly cold and wet. (C) 2008 National Natural

   streamflow trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Eurasian river discharge into the Arctic Ocean has steadily increased
   during the 20th century, and many studies have documented the spatial
   distribution of the trends and hypothesized the causes. There is a large
   variation in the scope of these studies, including the spatial scale of
   interest, and they often lack consistency in the time period analyzed.
   Studies have shown a connection between changes in the seasonal snowpack
   and discharge, but they have been constrained by the limitations of the
   snow observational network, which contains few long-term stations. This
   study overcomes these problems by using both in situ observations and a
   land surface model to evaluate the role snowpack changes have had on
   increases in runoff across northern Eurasia from 1936 through 1999. Our
   analysis shows consistent trends in both observations and model
   predictions. Increases in cold season precipitation propagate into
   increases in maximum snow water equivalent, which lead to increases in
   runoff. A series of model experiments demonstrate that the nonlinear
   interaction between winter precipitation and temperature has driven
   changes in the snowpack, which are manifested in the modeled runoff
   trends. Given that winter precipitation is expected to continue to
   increase and temperatures to warm during the 21st century in this
   region, these results point to the importance in understanding how the
   projected changes will influence the seasonal snowpack, which may have
   important consequences for streamflow in this region and freshwater
   export to the Arctic Ocean.},

Abstract = {This study deals with the historical hydro-climatological watershed
   characteristics of the Litani basin located in Lebanon, east of the
   Mediterranean Sea, during 1900-2008. The basin is divided into two
   distinct sub-basins. The Upper Litani Basin (ULB) is mostly dominated by
   mountainous geophysical features and the Lower Litani Basin (LLB) is
   closer to the Mediterranean coast. Monthly and annual temperature and
   precipitation data were generated from different sources, including
   global gridded data, satellite data, and local station data. Because
   long-term runoff records were not available, previously generated
   monthly synthetic runoff data were employed. Temperature and
   precipitation trends were investigated using the Mann-Kendall and Sen
   Slope nonparametric trend tests. The mean annual and monthly runoff were
   subsequently correlated with temperature and precipitation variations
   using a multiple linear regression approach. The results show that
   between 1900 and 2008, the whole Litani basin, including both
   sub-basins, experienced a drying trend without a significant change in
   temperature. However, within the period of 1970-2008, the whole basin
   grew notably warmer in all seasons, without being wetter; this climatic
   pattern was reflected in the LLB but not in the ULB, which was only
   slightly warmer, but also slightly wetter in this period. In addition,
   the results revealed distinctive seasonal and annual correlations
   between temperature and precipitation changes and the basin's runoff.
   However, runoff for both the ULB and the LLB was shown to more
   frequently correlate with precipitation than with temperature. Positive
   correlations were found between runoff and precipitation during winter
   and wet seasons, and a negative correlation was detected during winter
   between temperature and runoff variations of the ULB. Hence, the
   continuation of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation
   trends may pose a threat to future water resources in the Litani as a
   whole, and the ULB in particular. DOI:

   taken at 11 meteorological stations located in the Langat River Basin in
   Malaysia. The rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature data were
   obtained from the Malaysia Meteorological Department (MMD) and the
   Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) Malaysia. The procedures
   used included the Mann-Kendall test, the Mann-Kendall rank statistic
   test, and the Theil-Sen's slope method. The analytical results indicated
   that when there were increasing and decreasing trends in the annual and
   seasonal precipitation and temperature, only the increasing trends were
   significant at the 95\% confidence level. The Theil-Sen's slope method
   showed that the rate of increment in the annual precipitation is greater
   than the seasonal precipitation. A bootstrap technique was applied to
   explore uncertainty about significant slope values for rainfall, as well
   as the maximum and minimum temperatures. The Mann-Kendall rank
   statistics test indicated that most of the trends in the annual and
   seasonal time series started in the year 2000. All of the annual and
   seasonal significant trends were obtained at the stations located in the
   north, east, and northeast portions of the Langat River Basin.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian Midwest has significant spatiotemporal variability in
   terms of precipitation and air temperature, making it more vulnerable to
   the occurrence of extreme weather events. The objective of this study is
   to characterize the trend of extreme climatic events regarding
   precipitation and air temperature in the Brazilian Midwest, and to
   analyze their relationship with Pacific and Atlantic Sea Surface
   Temperature anomalies (SSTAs). We used daily precipitation and air
   temperature data measured at 24 conventional weather stations. Pacific
   and Atlantic SSTA data were obtained from the Climate Prediction Center.
   The frequency of hot extremes had increased, while that of cold extremes
   had decreased significantly, thus highlighting the consistent warming
   across the Brazilian Midwest. The precipitation extremes had greater
   variability than the temperature extremes. Precipitation intensity
   increased in Amazonia, with no change in annual precipitation volume.
   The precipitation extremes in the Brazilian Savanna, Pantanal, and the
   Atlantic Forest did not have a well-defined pattern but indicated a
   trend towards a decrease in days with intense precipitation events. In
   general, the Equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Ocean (TNAI and TSAI) SSTAs
   were negatively correlated with precipitation extreme indices and
   positively correlated with air temperature extreme indices in the
   Amazon. However, the North Atlantic SSTAs were positively correlated
   with precipitation and air temperature extreme indices in the Brazilian
   Savanna and Pantanal. In addition, the Pacific SSTAs were positively
   correlated with precipitation intensity in the Atlantic Forest. Thus,
   the variability of the trends of precipitation and air temperature
   extreme indices in the Brazilian Midwest was observed, and it was
   surmised that this measure was significantly related to Pacific and
   Atlantic SSTAs.},

Title = {Using Climate Divisions to Analyze Variations and Trends in Alaska
   Temperature and Precipitation},

Abstract = {By extending the record of Alaskan divisional temperature and
   precipitation back in time, regional variations and trends of
   temperature and precipitation over 1920-2012 are documented. The use of
   the divisional framework highlights the greater spatial coherence of
   temperature variations relative to precipitation variations.
   The divisional time series of temperature are characterized by large
   interannual variability superimposed upon low-frequency variability, as
   well as by an underlying trend. Low-frequency variability corresponding
   to the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) includes Alaska's generally
   warm period of the 1920s and 1930s, a cold period from the late 1940s
   through the mid-1970s, a warm period from the late 1970s through the
   early 2000s, and a cooler period in the most recent decade. An exception
   to the cooling of the past decade is the North Slope climate division,
   which has continued to warm. There has been a gradual upward trend of
   Alaskan temperatures relative to the PDO since 1920, resulting in a
   statewide average warming of about 1 degrees C.
   In contrast to temperature, variations of precipitation are less
   consistent across climate divisions and have much less multidecadal
   character. Thirty-year trends of both variables are highly sensitive to
   the choice of the subperiod within the overall 93-yr period. The trends
   also vary seasonally, with winter and spring contributing the most to
   the annual trends.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Variation in quantities such as precipitation and temperature is often
   assessed by detecting and characterizing trends in available
   meteorological data. The objective of this study was to determine the
   long-term trends in annual precipitation and mean annual air temperature
   for the state of Kentucky. Non-parametric statistical tests were applied
   to homogenized and (as needed) pre-whitened annual series of
   precipitation and mean air temperature during 1950-2010. Significant
   trends in annual precipitation were detected (both positive, averaging
   4.1 mm/year) for only two of the 60 precipitation-homogenous weather
   stations (Calloway and Carlisle counties in rural western Kentucky).
   Only three of the 42 temperature-homogenous stations demonstrated trends
   (all positive, averaging 0.01 degrees C/year) in mean annual
   temperature: Calloway County, Allen County in southern-central Kentucky,
   and urbanized Jefferson County in northern-central Kentucky. In view of
   the locations of the stations demonstrating positive trends, similar
   work in adjacent states will be required to better understand the
   processes responsible for those trends and to properly place them in
   their larger context, if any.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the long-term changes in temperature and
   precipitation in the karst region of Imotski, Croatia, which is of
   particular interest due to its abundance of karst phenomena. This study
   analyses temperatures and precipitation on monthly and annual scales at
   two climatological stations in the region, Imotski and Ri.cice. Linear
   regression, the Theil-Sen estimator (b), and the Mann-Kendall test were
   used to determine the trends and statistical significance. The
   homogeneity of the data was checked using the Standard Normal
   Homogeneity Test (SNHT), and the F-test and t-test were used to test the
   significance of the mean shift between the two subseries. Additionally,
   the coefficient of variability, standardized rainfall anomaly, and
   precipitation concentration index were employed to analyze the
   precipitation variability. The study found a statistically significant
   (p < 0.05) upward trend in the mean (beta = 0.0437) and maximum (beta =
   0.0590) annual air temperature at the Imotski station and the mean (beta
   = 0.0387) annual temperature at the Ricice station. The SNHT test showed
   a statistically significant (p < 0.05) shift in the mean annual
   temperatures after 2007 and maximum annual temperatures after 1998 at
   the Imotski station. Similarly, a statistically significant (p < 0.05)
   shift in the mean annual temperatures after 2011 and the maximum annual
   temperatures after 1998 was found at the Ri.cice station. A seasonal
   distribution of precipitation is observed at both the Ri.cice and
   Imotski stations, with a downward trend (beta = 2.7693) at Ri.cice and
   an upward trend (beta = 6.0575) at Imotski; however, neither trend is
   statistically significant (p > 0.05). An increase in the intensity of
   dry periods and the occurrence of extreme events was also noted. The
   climatological analysis, conducted for the first time in this area, is a
   crucial step toward understanding local climate patterns and making
   informed decisions toward sustainable development and adaptation
   strategies.},

Title = {Temperature-precipitation trends and response of high-altitude
   biodiversity reserve of western Himalayas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {133},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {Biodiversity reserves are a crucial in-situ method to conserve
   biodiversity hotspots as they are sensitive to climate change. The Nanda
   Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in the western Himalayas is enriched with
   diverse endemic flora and fauna and endorses the second-highest mountain
   peak in the world. However, in the recent decade, this region has
   potentially warmed at an alarming rate. With 36 temperature and
   precipitation indices from high-resolution 40-year data from ERA5
   reanalysis and CHIRPS, this paper assesses the state of warming and
   extreme climatic events. Apart from the indices, Landsat (NASA/USGS,
   USA) and QuickSCAT (ISRO, India) were utilized to assess the region's
   response to climate change. An increase of 0.73oC in the last decade for
   minimum, 0.26 degrees C for maximum temperatures was observed, with the
   highest anomaly of 1.7 degrees C in 2016. The reserve's vegetation
   pattern has changed with the vegetative region's dispersal towards the
   north and higher elevations. In the year 2000, the area without any
   vegetation covered 79\% of the total area, which declined to a mere
   23.8\% in the year 2020, equivalent to a 70\% decline in the area.
   Similarly, the area with very dense region covered only 0.02\% of the
   total area in the year 2000, and in the year 2020, it increased to
   109\%. Snow cover seems to be worst affected in the region with dense
   snow cover declining maximum by 2020. From coverage of 12.3\% of the
   total area of the reserves, it was reduced to a mere 0.02\%, showing a
   decline of nearly 100\% in the region. Our findings show that although
   protected areas are meant to be resilient to external anthropogenic
   intrusions, they are highly susceptible to the intrinsic forces of
   induced climate change. We suggest that reserve managers enable robust
   measures to identify the distribution of vulnerable species and
   introduce new methods to preserve the pristine hotspot region.},

Title = {RESPONSE OF SOIL EROSION IN A MOUNTAINOUS CATCHMENT TO TEMPERATURE AND

Abstract = {This study is an attempt to assess the effects of temperature and
   precipitation variability to soil erosion in mountainous catchments. In
   order to achieve this goal, long-term meteorological time series
   (1961-2011) of Pertouli meteorological station was processed and
   analyzed. The Mann-Kendall non parametric statistical test was applied
   to detect trends in the mean annual temperature and precipitation. The
   results of the Mann-Kendall test indicate statistical decreasing trend
   for precipitation and statistical significant increasing trend for
   temperature. Moreover, the beginning of the change is associated to 1985
   in case of precipitation and 1990 for temperature. Based on the Mann -
   Kendal test results, the study period was divided to two sub-periods,
   namely: 1961-1985 and 1986-2011. Finally, the erosion prediction model
   of Gavrilovic was used to quantify the effect of those trends on soil
   erosion. The comparison of the results showed that the value of mean
   annual soil erosion decreased by 2.8 t ha(-1) yr(-1) during 1986-2011
   when precipitation decreased by 15\% and temperature increased by 5\%.},

Title = {Modelled glacier response to centennial temperature and precipitation
   trends on the Antarctic Peninsula},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},

Volume = {4},

Pages = {993-998},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The northern Antarctic Peninsula is currently undergoing rapid
   atmospheric warming(1). Increased glacier-surface melt during the
   twentieth century(2,3) has contributed to ice-shelf collapse and the
   widespread acceleration(4), thinning and recession(5) of glaciers.
   Therefore, glaciers peripheral to the Antarctic Ice Sheet currently make
   a large contribution to eustatic sea-level rise(6,7), but future melting
   may be offset by increased precipitation(8). Here we assess
   glacier-climate relationships both during the past and into the future,
   using ice-core and geological data and glacier and climate numerical
   model simulations. Focusing on Glacier IJR45 on James Ross Island,
   northeast Antarctic Peninsula, our modelling experiments show that this
   representative glacier is most sensitive to temperature change, not
   precipitation change. We determine that its most recent expansion
   occurred during the late Holocene `Little Ice Age' and not during the
   warmer mid-Holocene, as previously proposed(9). Simulations using a
   range of future Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate
   scenarios indicate that future increases in precipitation are unlikely
   to offset atmospheric-warming-induced melt of peripheral Antarctic
   Peninsula glaciers.},

Title = {Trends in daily observed temperature and precipitation extremes over

Abstract = {Ethiopia has wide eco-environmental diversity ranging from extreme heat
   at one of the lowest places in the world to one of the coolest summits
   in Africa. Associated with this environmental diversity and climate
   change, climatic extremes are expected to change over time and also vary
   across eco-environments in the country. This study was conducted to
   examine the trends of past precipitation and temperature extremes over
   three eco-environments in Ethiopia. The study involved analysis of 20
   extreme indices computed from daily temperature and precipitation data
   spanning over 42 years (1967-2008). The climate data were obtained from
   11 stations selected from three major eco-environments (pastoral,
   agropastoral and highland). The results indicated positive trends for
   maximum value of the maximum temperature (TXx), warm days (TX90p), warm
   nights (TN90p) and warm spell duration indicators (WSDI) and negative
   trends for cool days (TX10p), cool nights (TN10p) and cold spell
   duration indicators (CSDI) in more than 8 of the 11 stations studied.
   However, most of the trends were not significant at many of the stations
   and the significant trends were not uniquely differentiated by
   eco-environments. Unlike temperature extremes, precipitation extreme
   trends showed high variability among nearby stations within
   eco-environments and were not significant at many of the stations
   studied. It is concluded that trends of temperature and precipitation
   extremes vary considerably among stations located within a given
   eco-environment indicating that the response of local climate to global
   warming could be different in physiographically diverse regions.},

Title = {Temperature and precipitation in the US states: long memory,

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},

Number = {3-4},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the time series properties of the temperature
   and precipitation anomalies in the contiguous USA by using fractional
   differentiation. This methodology allows to capture time trend
   components along with properties such as long-range dependence and the
   degree of persistence. For aggregated data, we find out that long memory
   is present in both precipitation and temperature since the integration
   order is significantly positive in the two cases. The time trend is also
   positive, being higher for the temperature. In addition, observing
   disaggregated data by states, for the temperature, there are only seven
   states where the time trend is not significant, with most of them
   located in Southeast areas, while for the rest of cases, the time trend
   is significantly positive. All cases exhibit long-range dependence,
   though the differencing parameter substantially changes from one state
   to another, ranging from 0.09 in Nebraska and Kansas to 0.18 in Florida
   and Michigan. For precipitation, the time trend is insignificant in a
   large number of cases, and the integration order is smaller than for the
   temperature. In fact, short memory cannot be rejected in fourteen
   states, and the highest orders of differencing are obtained in Arizona
   (d = 0.11) and Texas (0.12). In general, we highlight that one cannot
   draw conclusions about persistence and trends in these two
   climate-related variables based on aggregate information of the overall
   USA, given widespread heterogeneity across the states. Tentatively, the
   degree of dependence across the states seems to be negatively correlated
   with their level of climate-related risks and the associated
   preparedness in terms of handling climate change, but this conclusion
   requires more elaborate research in the future.},

Title = {Trends in atmospheric patterns conducive to seasonal precipitation and
   temperature extremes in California},
Journal = {SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that changes in atmospheric circulation have
   altered the probability of extreme climate events in the Northern
   Hemisphere. We investigate northeastern Pacific atmospheric circulation
   patterns that have historically (1949-2015) been associated with
   cool-season (October-May) precipitation and temperature extremes in
   California. We identify changes in occurrence of atmospheric circulation
   patterns by measuring the similarity of the cool-season atmospheric
   configuration that occurred in each year of the 1949-2015 period with
   the configuration that occurred during each of the five driest, wettest,
   warmest, and coolest years. Our analysis detects statistically
   significant changes in the occurrence of atmospheric patterns associated
   with seasonal precipitation and temperature extremes. We also find a
   robust increase in the magnitude and subseasonal persistence of the
   cool-season West Coast ridge, resulting in an amplification of the
   background state. Changes in both seasonal mean and extreme event
   configurations appear to be caused by a combination of spatially
   nonuniform thermal expansion of the atmosphere and reinforcing trends in
   the pattern of sea level pressure. In particular, both thermal expansion
   and sea level pressure trends contribute to a notable increase in
   anomalous northeastern Pacific ridging patterns similar to that observed
   during the 2012-2015 California drought. Collectively, our empirical
   findings suggest that the frequency of atmospheric conditions like those
   during California's most severely dry and hot years has increased in
   recent decades, but not necessarily at the expense of patterns
   associated with extremely wet years.},

Abstract = {Climate change has been attracting significant attention in Canada
   lately. This study investigates spatiotemporal air temperature and
   precipitation changes by developing high-resolution (i.e., 1 m x 1 km
   grid) climate maps from 1971 to 2020. The climate monitoring data are
   collected and synthesized from various sources, and then used to develop
   high-resolution climate maps with state-of-the-art spatial interpolation
   methods. The error metrics results show that the inverse distance
   weighting method performs the best for air temperature and precipitation
   and thus is used in this study. Significant temporal trends show that
   the annual mean temperature increased by 0.03 degrees C/year in western
   and eastern Prince Edward Island (PEI), covering 62.75\% of PEI area.
   Similarly, the annual precipitation has decreased by around 4.8 mm/year
   in Prince County and eastern parts of Queens and Kings Counties,
   covering 62.81\% of PEI area. In growing season, temperature has
   increased by 0.05 degrees C/year and precipitation is decreased by 2.1
   mm/year in Prince County. This information illustrates the dynamics of
   temperature and precipitation toward the changing climate.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the long-term trends and variations of temperature
   and precipitation on annual timescale in the Ili-Balkhash Basin (IBB),
   Kazakhstan. Some statistical tools were employed to detect any climate
   variations at four stations in the IBB during the period between 1936
   and 2005. These methods included the Mann-Kendall trend test, the
   Theil-Sen approach, and the sequential Mann-Kendall test. The results
   showed that in temporal scale, the climate in the IBB has been becoming
   warmer and wetter in the past several decades as a whole. The annual
   mean temperature and the annual precipitation in the IBB showed an
   increasing trend since the 1970s and the 1940s, respectively. The
   significance of the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation
   trends in the IBB was tested at > 95 \% confidence level. The slope of
   the increasing trend of annual mean temperature ranges from 0.019 to
   0.029 A degrees C/year, and that of the annual precipitation ranges from
   0.654 to 2.179 mm/year. In spatial scale, the multiyear mean values of
   temperature and precipitation are greater in the southern mountain
   region than those in the northern plain and hilly land area of the
   basin. The multiyear mean temperature decreases with the increasing
   latitudes, while increases with the increasing altitudes except for
   Karaganda; the multiyear mean precipitation increase with the increasing
   altitudes, while decreases centered with the Lake Balkhash from the
   surrounding area. The results may provide climatic backgrounds for
   solving the problems related to water sources of the IBB.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to analyse the trends in 20 annual
   extreme indices of temperature and precipitation for Utah, USA. The
   analyses were conducted for 28 meteorological stations, during the
   period from 1930 to 2006, characterized by a long-term and high-quality
   dataset. The software used to process the data was the RClimdex 1.0. The
   analyses of extreme temperature indices have identified an increase in
   air temperature in Utah during the last century. Meanwhile, the analyses
   of precipitation indices showed a large variation throughout the studied
   area and time period, and, in general, with few statistically
   significant trends. Thus, it was not possible to conclude that
   significant changes in precipitation have occurred in this region over
   the last century. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Documenting long-term trends or persistent shifts in temperature and
   precipitation is important for understanding present and future changes
   in flora and fauna. Carefully adjusted datasets for climate records in
   the USA and Canada are combined and used here to describe the spatial
   and seasonal variation in trends in the maritime, central, and Rocky
   Mountain climatic zones of the Pacific Northwest. Trends during the 20th
   century in annually averaged temperature (0.7degreesC-0.9degreesC) and
   precipitation (13\%-38\%) exceed the global averages. Largest warming
   rates occurred in the maritime zone and in winter and at lower
   elevations in all zones, and smallest warming rates occurred in autumn
   and in the Rockies. Largest increases in precipitation (upwards of 60\%
   per century) were observed in the dry areas in northeast Washington and
   south central British Columbia. Increases in precipitation were largest
   in spring, but were also large in summer in the central and Rocky
   Mountain climatic zones. These trends have already had profound impacts
   on streamflow and on certain plant species in the region (Cayan et al.
   2001), and other important impacts remain to be discovered. The warming
   observed in winter and spring can be attributed partially to climatic
   variations over the Pacific Ocean, and the buildup of greenhouse gases
   probably also plays an important role.},

Title = {Trends in indices of daily temperature and precipitation extremes in
   Europe, 1946-99},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2003},

Number = {22},
Pages = {3665-3680},

Abstract = {Trends in indices of climate extremes are studied on the basis of daily
   series of temperature and precipitation observations from more than 100
   meteorological stations in Europe. The period is 1946-99, a warming
   episode. Averaged over all stations, the indices of temperature extremes
   indicate ``symmetric'' warming of the cold and warm tails of the
   distributions of daily minimum and maximum temperature in this period.
   However, ``asymmetry'' is found for the trends if the period is split
   into two subperiods. For the 1946-75 subperiod, an episode of slight
   cooling, the annual number of warm extremes decreases, but the annual
   number of cold extremes does not increase. This implies a reduction in
   temperature variability. For the 1976-99 subperiod, an episode of
   pronounced warming, the annual number of warm extremes increases 2 times
   faster than expected from the corresponding decrease in the number of
   cold extremes. This implies an increase in temperature variability,
   which is mainly due to stagnation in the warming of the cold extremes.
   For precipitation, all Europe-average indices of wet extremes increase
   in the 1946-99 period, although the spatial coherence of the trends is
   low. At stations where the annual amount increases, the index that
   represents the fraction of the annual amount due to very wet days gives
   a signal of disproportionate large changes in the extremes. At stations
   with a decreasing annual amount, there is no such amplified response of
   the extremes.
   The indices of temperature and precipitation extremes in this study were
   selected from the list of climate change indices recommended by the
   World Meteorological Organization-Commission for Climatology (WMO-CCL)
   and the Research Programme on Climate Variability and Predictability
   (CLIVAR). The selected indices are expressions of events with return
   periods of 5-60 days. This means that the annual number of events is
   sufficiently large to allow for meaningful trend analysis in similar
   to50 yr time series. Although the selected indices refer to events that
   may be called ``soft'' climate extremes, these indices have clear impact
   relevance.},

Abstract = {This paper examines monthly, seasonal, and annual trends in temperature
   and precipitation time series in Osijek during the period between 1900
   and 2018. Two new methods, innovative trend analysis (ITA) and
   successive average methodology (SAM), together with the classic
   Mann-Kendall (M-K) and Sen's slope methods, have been applied to
   determine potential trends in the variables at different time scales.
   Moreover, time series decomposition using locally estimated scatterplot
   smoothing (STL) was conducted to determine trend, seasonality, and the
   relationship between the components of each variable. Regarding the air
   temperature, ITA showed a monotonic positive trend at relatively low (T
   <= 10 degrees C) and high (T >= 13 degrees C) temperature ranges in all
   seasons, excluding spring. A positive trend was also found in the medium
   temperature range in this season, which agrees with the results of M-K
   test. The highest Sen's slope was obtained in January, with the second
   highest in April. According to the results acquired for the observed
   precipitation time series, it was discovered that Osijek has experienced
   a decreasing trend in spring precipitation. However, there is no trend
   in annual precipitation at a 5\% significance level. Differing from the
   M-K results, the ITA shows a decreasing trend in both spring and autumn
   seasons. Summer precipitation increases with a significant change in the
   high precipitating levels (p >= 100 mm). Comparing successive pairs of
   partial trends in both historical temperature and precipitation, our
   results show that trends in peak and trough change-points are very close
   to each other, indicating a slight positive trend in temperature and a
   negative change in precipitation over the past century.},

Abstract = {The present study analyzed precipitation and temperature trends of 45
   years (1971-2015) over two protected areas (Kanha Tiger Reserve
   representing Sal forest and Satpura Tiger Reserve representing Teak
   forest) in Central India. The specific trends (decadal, annual, and
   seasonal) are calculated from various available data sources (IMD, REMO,
   and Station) which are at different horizontal resolutions. The
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test statistic and Sen's estimate methods
   are used to detect the presence and quantum of a trend. The results
   indicate significant decrease in post-monsoon and winter precipitation
   and an increasing significant temperature trend (Tmean, Tmax, Tmin) at
   seasonal, annual, and decadal scale, with a maximum increase during
   post-monsoon. Also, the last decade (2001-2010) was warmer than the
   previous three decades. The presence of break points and structural
   changes in climatic variables are analyzed using OLS-CUSUM and MOSUM
   tests available in ``strucchange{''} package in R. A structural change
   in precipitation was observed only in REMO dataset over Satpura Tiger
   Reserve, whereas significant structural change in temperature was
   observed in REMO dataset over both the regions. These findings are
   useful for assessing precipitation and temperature trends in protected
   areas. In particular, it can aid in understanding the impact of climate
   change on forest/species. On comparative analysis among different data

Abstract = {The article presents the results of a study on the assessment of modern
   space-time trends of extreme values of air temperature and precipitation
   in 42 meteorological stations throughout Kazakhstan for the period from
   1971 to 2020. Spatial and temporal analysis of the distribution of
   specialized climatic indices was recommended by the WMO climatology
   commission and an assessment of their trends was carried out. Spatial
   heterogeneity was revealed in terms of the degree of manifestation of
   changes and trends. Temperature indices are shown to confirm the overall
   warming trend. The division of the territory of Kazakhstan by the degree
   of manifestation of climate change into the southwestern and
   northeastern half was revealed. Extreme trends are most pronounced in
   the southwestern half, where a significant trend has been identified
   both for an increase in extremely high daytime and extremely low night
   temperatures. The calculated trends in temperature indices are generally
   significant, but the significance is mainly not ubiquitous; the trends
   are significant only in certain parts of Kazakhstan. WSDI and CSDI
   trends were found to confirm a widespread increase in the overall
   duration of heat waves and a reduction in the overall duration of cold
   waves. No significant extreme effects were found in the sediments. It is
   confirmed that Kazakhstan has weak, statistically insignificant,
   positive and negative trends in the maximum duration of the
   non-traveling period. Precipitation index trends, unlike temperature
   ones, are statistically insignificant in most of the country.},

Title = {Impact of land use and precipitation changes on surface temperature
   trends in Argentina},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Number = {D6},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {{[} 1] The ``observation minus reanalysis'' ( OMR) method has been used
   to estimate the impact of changes in land use ( including urbanization
   and agricultural practices such as irrigation) by computing the
   difference between the trends of the surface observations ( which
   reflect all the sources of climate forcing, including surface effects)
   and the NCEP/ NCAR reanalysis ( which only contains the forcings
   influencing the assimilated atmospheric trends). In this paper we apply
   the OMR method to surface stations in Argentina for the period 1961 -
   2000. In contrast to most other land areas, over most of Argentina there
   has been net cooling, not warming ( about -0.04 degrees C/ decade).
   Observations also show a very strong decrease in the diurnal temperature
   range north of 40 degrees S. This is associated with an observed strong
   reduction in the maximum temperature ( -0.12 degrees C/ decade) together
   with a weak warming trend in the minimum temperature ( 0.05 degrees C/
   decade). The OMR trends show a warming contribution to the mean
   temperature (+0.07 degrees C/ decade) and a decrease in diurnal
   temperature range ( -0.08 degrees C/ decade), especially strong in the
   areas where the observed precipitation has increased the most and where,
   as a consequence, there has been an exponential increase of soy
   production in the last decade. The increase in precipitation is
   apparently associated with an increase in the moisture transport from
   the Amazons to northern Argentina by the low-level jet.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes the proportion of snowfall days relative to
   precipitation days, in order to assess the impact of changing
   temperatures on snowfall, while minimizing the impact of variations in
   precipitation frequency and intensity. We analyzed the ratio of snowfall
   days to precipitation days for up to 100 years at 76 meteorological
   stations, spanning elevations from 200 to 2700 m asl in Switzerland. Our
   results show clear decreasing trends in snowfall days relative to
   precipitation days. These decreases are connected to increasing
   temperatures. The decrease in snowfall days was stronger at lower
   elevations, i.e., at locations with temperatures closer to the melting
   point. We observed a baseline seasonal temperature threshold of -2.7
   degrees C +/- 0.8 degrees C in winter and -3.8 degrees C +/- 0.6 degrees
   C in spring, above which the decrease in snowfall days grew rapidly.
   From these observations, we developed an empirical model that can be
   used to evaluate the impact of future temperature increases on snowfall,
   independent of changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation
   events. Citation: Serquet, G., C. Marty, J.-P. Dulex, and M. Rebetez (

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the spatial dependence of annual diurnal temperature
   range (DTR) trends from 1950-2004 on the annual climatology of three
   variables: precipitation, cloud cover, and leaf area index (LAI), by
   classifying the global land into various climatic regions based on the
   climatological annual precipitation. The regional average trends for
   annual minimum temperature (T (min)) and DTR exhibit significant spatial
   correlations with the climatological values of these three variables,
   while such correlation for annual maximum temperature (T (max)) is very
   weak. In general, the magnitude of the downward trend of DTR and the
   warming trend of T (min) decreases with increasing precipitation amount,
   cloud cover, and LAI, i.e., with stronger DTR decreasing trends over
   drier regions. Such spatial dependence of T (min) and DTR trends on the
   climatological precipitation possibly reflects large-scale effects of
   increased global greenhouse gases and aerosols (and associated changes
   in cloudiness, soil moisture, and water vapor) during the later half of
   the twentieth century.},

Title = {Trend Analysis of Relationship between Primary Productivity,
   Precipitation and Temperature in Inner Mongolia},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study mainly examined the relationships among primary productivity,
   precipitation and temperature by identifying trends of change embedded
   in time-series data. The paper also explores spatial variations of the
   relationship over four types of vegetation and across two precipitation
   zones in Inner Mongolia, China. Traditional analysis of vegetation
   response to climate change uses minimum, maximum, average or cumulative
   measurements; focuses on a whole region instead of fine-scale regional
   or ecological variations; or adopts generic analysis techniques. We
   innovatively integrate Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Redundancy
   Analysis (RDA) to overcome the weakness of traditional approaches. The
   EMD filtered trend surfaces reveal clear patterns of Enhanced Vegetation
   Index (EVI), precipitation, and temperature changes in both time and
   space. The filtered data decrease noises and cyclic fluctuations in the
   original data and are more suitable for examining linear relationship
   than the original data. RDA is further applied to reveal partial effect
   of precipitation and temperature, and their joint effect on primary
   productivity. The main findings are as follows: (1) We need to examine
   relationships between the trends of change of the variables of interest
   when investigating long-term relationships among them. (2) Long-term
   trend of change of precipitation or temperature can become a critical
   factor influencing primary productivity depending on local environments.
   (3) Synchronization (joint effect) of precipitation and temperature in
   growing season is critically important to primary productivity in the
   study area. (4) Partial and joint effects of precipitation and
   temperature on primary productivity vary over different precipitation
   zones and different types of vegetation. The method developed in this
   paper is applicable to ecosystem research in other regions.},

   either above normal Tn (mostly in cool highland areas) or below normal
   Tn (especially lowland, hot environments and early parts of the rainy
   season). Tx generally displays a more consistent response to rainfall
   occurrence, with cooling peaking 1 day after the rainfall event. However
   there is often a persistence of this cooling several days after the
   rainfall event, and the amplitude of the cooling is also greater for
   heavy rainfall events. These temperature anomalies are thought to be a
   response to cloudiness (concurrent reduced Tx and concurrent enhanced
   Tn) and soil moisture (reduced Tx and Tn, suggested to reflect
   evaporative cooling). These relationships are of relevance to the
   interpretation of temperature trends. From 1973 to 2013, the GHA shows a
   clear warming signal, for both Tn (+0.20 to +0.25 A degrees C/decade
   depending on seasons) and Tx (+0.17 to +0.22 A degrees C/decade).
   Rainfall shows both negative (mostly between February and July) and
   positive trends (mostly in October-December). Given the superimposition
   of temperature and rainfall trends in parts of the GHA and the
   covariations between daily rainfall and both Tx and Tn, regression
   models are used to extract the rainfall influence on temperature,
   accounting for lag effects up to 4 days. The daily residuals from these
   models are used to depict temperature variations independent from
   precipitation variations. At some stations, trends computed on these
   residuals noticeably differ from the raw Tx trends. When averaged across
   the GHA, these effects do not exceed -0.06 to +0.03 A degrees C/decade
   (depending on the month) for Tx, and are marginal for Tn, thus do not
   strongly modify the magnitude of the warming in the last 40 years.
   Nevertheless, these results show that precipitation-temperature
   relationships must be addressed when analyzing temperature changes.},

   precipitation and monthly temperature data of Shaheed Benazir Abad for
   the period of 1996-2014 are considered. The result shows that the
   Diurnal temperature range of all months is decreasing due to the
   increasing of monthly minimum temperature at a faster rate than the
   monthly maximum temperature. However, the Diurnal temperature range of
   extreme events is increasing. The results obtained by using Mann-Kendall
   test revealed that rainfall exhibits significant positive trend. The
   trends of rainfall and rainy days show that the amount of rainfall is
   increasing much more rapidly than that of rainy days which indicates the

Abstract = {Urbanization has a significant impact on climate in urban areas. In this
   study, we investigate urbanization impacts on temperature and
   precipitation trends in Korean peninsula based on statistical
   relationship between these trends and local population growth. We found
   that there is a significant positive correlation between temperature
   rise and local population growth, indicating that urbanization has a
   significant contribution to temperature increase in city climate. As for
   temperature, the population growth in Korean cities is positively
   correlated with precipitation trend. The positive correlation is higher
   during summer time when small-scale convective activity is dominant.
   Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the correlation is significantly
   increased when stations in rural areas and small cities are excluded.
   Such nonlinear relation between precipitation and urbanization is also
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This study investigated trends in hydro-climate data (precipitation,
   maximum/minimum temperatures, and streamflow) for the period 1980-2016
   around a semi-arid Hadejia-Nguru wetlands (HNWs) in Northern Nigeria.
   Four meteorological stations (Bauchi, Kano, Hadejia, and Nguru) and
   three streamflow gauge statins (Hadejia, Katagum, and Gashua) were used
   to cover the HNWs' catchment. The data was checked for normality using
   Anderson-Darling and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Pettit's test was used to check
   for homogeneity in the data series, and absolute homogenization, using
   RHtestsV4 software, was applied to homogenize and pre-whiten the data
   series. Trend analysis was carried out using modified Mann-Kendall and
   Sen's slope tests. Results revealed increasing positive trends at all
   the stations for monthly minimum, average annual minimum, average annual
   maximum, and annual average temperature data series, while monthly
   maximum temperature series of Bauchi and Kano stations indicated the
   presence of an increasing trend with magnitudes 0.0035 degrees C and
   0.0019 degrees C; and no trend was detected for Hadejia and Nguru
   stations. For monthly precipitation, no trends were detected at all
   stations. However, an increasing trend was detected at Bauchi, Hadejia,
   and Nguru stations for mean annual precipitation with magnitude 7.7960
   mm/year, 8.1766 mm/year, and 5.7214 mm/year, respectively. A decreasing
   trend was detected for monthly and annual streamflow series at Hadejia
   gauge station with magnitude - 0.0115 m(3)/s/month and - 3.7037
   m(3)/s/year, respectively; and no trend was detected for monthly and
   annual streamflow series at Katagum and Gashua gauge stations. The trend
   analysis may be helpful for planning and management of water resources
   in the HNWs.},

Abstract = {Global warming and changes in precipitation patterns are among the major
   effects of climate change. In this study, the long-term variability in
   ambient surface temperature and precipitation were evaluated in the
   north central region of Nigeria (Abuja, Kogi, Kwara, Niger, and Plateau)
   using meteorological observations obtained from 1975 to 2008. Daily
   precipitation data from synoptic weather stations were carefully
   quality-controlled using the RClimdex 1.1 developed by Expert Team on
   Climate Change Detection, Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI). The
   quality-controlled dataset were homogenized using RHtestsV4 and the
   detected change points were adjusted. Results showed a decrease in cool
   nights and cool days (TN10P, TX10P), and increasing trend in warm nights
   and days (TN90P, TX90P). The trend in rainfall is variable compared to
   changes in temperature. The precipitation indices indicated increasing
   trend in total annual precipitation (PRCPTOT), and a significant
   decrease in the number of consecutive wet days (CWD) in this region. In
   general, regional changes in climate temperature and precipitation
   extremes were significant (p < 0.05) and could result in serious climate
   induced effects.},

Abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the variability and
   trends of the precipitation and temperature along with the trends in
   drought indices over the State of California. The non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall trend test is applied with a trend-free pre-whitening
   procedure in trend identification. A dataset containing 120-year (water
   years 1896-2015) monthly precipitation, average temperature, maximum
   temperature, minimum temperature and the Palmer Index for seven climatic
   regions of the state is used for this purpose. The results confirm
   previous work indicating that no clear trends are observed in
   precipitation, while a distinct warming trend is evident in temperature
   over the state. New findings of this study include: (1) in general, the
   variability of annual, winter (December-February) and spring (March-May)
   precipitation shows an increasing tendency, implying intensified
   frequency of the occurrence of dry or wet extremes; (2) on the annual
   scale and in the summer, statewide meteorological, hydrological and
   agricultural drought indices all have decreasing trends, indicating the
   more frequent occurrence of drought events; and (3) among seven regions,
   the South Coast Drainage region generally has the most significant
   warming trend, as well as the most significant declining trends in
   drought indices. Overall, these findings are highly meaningful from both
   theoretical and practical perspectives, in the context of providing
   critical information in developing prediction models and guiding water
   resources management practices, respectively.},

Title = {Four Decades of Surface Temperature, Precipitation, and Wind Speed
   Trends over Lakes of Greece},

Abstract = {Climate change is known to affect world's lakes in many ways. Lake
   warming is perhaps the most prominent impact of climate change but there
   is evidence that changes of precipitation and wind speed over the
   surface of the lakes may also have a significant effect on key
   limnological processes. With this study we explored the interannual
   trends of surface temperature, precipitation, and wind speed over 18
   lakes of Greece using ERA5-Land data spanning over a period of almost
   four decades. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to conduct
   time-series analysis in order to identify significant trends of change.
   Our results showed that surface temperature has significantly increased
   in all lakes with an average rate of change for annual temperature of
   0.43 degrees C decade(-1). With regard to precipitation, we identified
   significant trends for most lakes and particularly we found that
   precipitation decreased during the first two decades (1981-2000), but
   since 2000 it increased notably. Finally, wind speed did not show any
   significant change over the examined period with the exception for one
   lake. In summary, our work highlights the major climatic changes that
   have occurred in several freshwater bodies of Greece. Thus, it improves
   our understanding on how climate change may have impacted the ecology of
   these important ecosystems and may aid us to identify systems that are
   more vulnerable to future changes.},

Abstract = {Global climate change does not necessarily imply that temperature or
   precipitation is increasing at specific locations. The hypothesis of
   increasing temperature and precipitation trends associated with global
   climate change is tested using actual annual temperature and
   precipitation data for nine selected weather stations, spatially
   distributed across Canada. Vogelsang's (1998) partial sum and Woodward
   et al's (1997) bootstrap methods are used for testing for trend Both
   methods suggest no warming in the Canadian temperature series except for
   Toronto, Ontario, which had significant increase over time, along with
   Moncton, New Brunswick and Indian Head, Saskatchewan, which had marginal
   increases. There is no evidence of increasing trend in precipitation
   except for Moncton, New Brunswick, which had a significantly increasing
   trend, thus, public policies designed to address the regional effects of
   climate change need to be adapted for a particular ecological zone,
   based on knowledge of the climate trends for that region, rather than on
   general global climate change patterns.},

Abstract = {The objective of the present study was to reconstruct a short-term
   (12-14 years) trend of surface temperature and precipitation patterns
   using their surrogates as provided by satellite images for selected
   locations along the Red Sea mountains in Saudi Arabia. Time series land
   surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) data acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite were temporally plotted to delineate
   the trend and the decadal rates of change of both parameters. Results
   showed that real climate change is reported in the study area during the
   study period. There is a net increasing in the surface temperatures by
   0.45 to 1.2 degrees C/decade and a net decrease in annual rainfall
   between 2001 and 2014. Findings of the present study show that the
   region is under a warming of the climate and a declining of wetness,
   which coincide with the air temperature and rainfall trends obtained
   from meteorological stations.},

Abstract = {At present one of the most essential problems in contemporary
   climatology is the problem of climate warming. Whereas the natural
   factors of climate changes show periodic variations, the anthropogenic
   factor of climate changes is characterized with a constant tendency of
   variation, i.e. a linear trend. Short-term trends of temporal climate
   changes depend, therefore on: natural periodicals, the level of
   pollution in the atmosphere and a non-measurable factor connected with
   randomness. Narrowing consideration to the Wielkopolska region, with
   main, centrally situated agglomeration of Poznan, one should notice,
   that the problem of climatic changes has a special meaning in this
   region. It results from the fact, that water resources in the
   Wielkopolska region are very small (the smallest in relation to other
   regions in Poland).
   Therefore, the subject discussed in his paper, concerning estimation of
   climate changes in Poznan during last 150 years (time series of air
   temperature and precipitation), seems to be vital for cognitive reasons
   as well as utilitarian.
   In the present study harmonical analysis (based on Fourier's series) is
   used for estimation of periodicity in air temperature and total
   precipitation. This method gives more information than for instance
   spectral analysis (autocorrelation method). The executed calculations
   based on initial data given (the means of monthly and yearly air
   temperature and precipitation between years 1848 divided by 2000 for
   Poznan), allow to draw the following synthetic conclusion: low temporal
   variability of mean yearly air temperature and total yearly
   precipitation indicates that climate in Poznan is substantially
   stationary.},

Abstract = {By investigating temperature and precipitation data from eight
   meteorological stations in the Syr Darya Basin (SDB) during 1881-2011
   and 1891-2011, we analyzed trends using the Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Our
   results indicated that there was a notable increasing trend in annual
   temperature of 0.14 degrees C/decade (P<0.05) and step change points in
   1989 (P<0.05). Similarly, annual precipitation showed a significant
   rising trend (P<0.001) at a rate of 4.44 mm/decade and step change
   points in 1991 (P<0.05). Overall, temperature and precipitation
   increases were more rapid in the plains than in the mountain areas,
   Furthermore, we found that temperature in the SDB region is strongly
   associated with the Asian Polar Vortex Area Index (APVAI, correlation
   coefficient: R=0.701, P<0.01) rather than with carbon dioxide emissions,
   especially in the plains area. For precipitation, the correlation
   coefficient is strongly associated with the Tibet Plateau Index (TPI.
   R=0.490, P<0.01), followed by the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AAOI,
   R=0.343, P<0.01), and the correlations in the plains are higher than
   those in the mountains. It is anticipated that the results of this study
   will further the understanding surrounding climate change in the SDB.},

Abstract = {The analysis of precipitation, temperature, and snow water equivalent
   (SWE) trends offers a scientific approach for understanding the impacts
   of climate change. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of
   climate change indicators in Lombardy, Italy, covering the yearly and
   monthly trends of precipitation and temperature from 1990 to 2020.
   Additionally, the yearly and monthly SWE variations. For this purpose, a
   range of statistical tests have been used including Mann-Kendall,
   Pettitt's change point detection and Sen's slope estimator.
   Precipitation trend shows a slight annual increase of around 5.42 mm per
   year. This trend is not statistically significant with a Mann-Kendall p
   value of 0.1448 and no changing point has been detected. Moreover,
   seasonal precipitation patterns show minor variations, with Kendall's
   Tau values ranging from - 0.0431 to 0.1761. However, none of these
   trends are statistically significant, as reflected in Mann-Kendall p
   values ranging from 0.1679 to 0.7339. Conversely, Lombardy is
   experiencing a significant annual temperature increase of 0.0436 degrees
   C. Notably, in Autumn, temperatures rise at a rate of 0.0565 degrees per
   year. Summer also shows a significant warming trend, with temperatures
   increasing by 0.0421 degrees per year. In Winter and Spring, there are
   milder, non-significant temperature trends, with Kendall's Tau values
   around 0.17. SWE trend shows minor annual variations (5-10\%) and
   monthly shifts. Winter shows a slight decrease (2-3\%), implying delayed
   snow accumulation, while Spring indicates minor change (1-2\%)
   suggesting earlier snowmelt. This study emphasizes temperature's strong
   impact on SWE and stresses the importance of climate monitoring and
   collaboration for understanding changing climate patterns.},

Abstract = {Trend detection based on hydroclimatological time series is crucial for
   understanding climate change. In this study, the innovative trend
   analysis (ITA) method was applied to investigate trends in air
   temperature and precipitation over the Jinsha River Basin (JRB), China,
   from 1961 to 2016 based on 40 meteorological stations. Climatic factors
   series were divided into three categories according to percentile, and
   the hidden trends were evaluated separately. The ITA results show that
   annual and seasonal temperatures have significantly increased whereas
   the variation range of annual temperature tended to narrow. Spatial
   pattern analysis of the temperature indicates that high elevation areas
   show more increasing trends than flat areas. Furthermore, according to
   ITA, significant increase trends are observed in annual precipitation
   and ``high{''} category of spring precipitation. The sub-basins results
   show a significant decreasing trend in elevation zones of <= 2000 m and
   an increasing trend where elevation is >2000 m. Moreover, linkage
   between temperature and precipitation was analyzed and the potential
   impact of the combined changes was demonstrated. The results of this
   study provide a reference for future water resources planning in the JRB
   and will help advance the understanding of climate change in similar

Abstract = {Transfer functions for converting pollen frequencies to estimates of
   mean July temperature and mean annual precipitation were applied to
   fossil pollen data from a sediment core in Marion Lake {[}Canada]. The
   paleotemperature curve shows low July temperatures near 14.degree. C at
   the base of the core at about 12,000 before present (B.P.), rising
   rapidly between 10,400 B.P. and 10,000 B.P. to maximum values slightly
   above 16.degree. C. Maximum temperatures cluster between 10,000 B.P. and
   approximately 7500 B.P., declining steadily thereafter until 6000 B.P.
   Little change is apparent from 6000 B.P. to the present. The
   reconstructed precipitation curve also shows a three-part zonation, with
   moderately high values between 12,000 and 10,400 B.P. dropping rapidly
   to minimum Holocene values between 10,000 and 7500 B.P. Precipitation
   rises to modern levels near the Mazama ash bed. The informal term early
   Holocene xerothermic interval is applied to the pre-Mazama interval of
   maximum temperatures and minimum precipitation. The late-glacial age at
   the base of the core is confirmed by a new radiocarbon date of 11,920
   .+-. 245 years B.P. (I-6857) on lodgepole pine needles screened from the
   basal clays.},

Title = {Simulated glacier responses to temperature and precipitation trends in a
   snowmelt-dominated river basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {106},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Global warming is causing glaciers to recede worldwide. The simulated
   glacier responses to temperature and precipitation trends in the Manas
   River Basin in China, a typical snowmelt-dominated region, were analyzed
   by correlation analysis, cross correlation function (CCF) and Granger
   causality tests (GCT). The rates of change in temperature and
   precipitation are 0.413 degrees C/10a and 1.806 mm/10a, respectively.
   Glacier reserves decreased continuously by 75.9\% from 1977 to 2016.
   There is a significant correlation between glacier reserves and the
   annual average temperature and annual precipitation. The increase in
   winter precipitation is not great enough to compensate for the glacier
   melt caused by the rising annual average temperature. A decrease in the
   winter precipitation or an increase in the annual average temperature
   causes a very significant decrease in the glacier reserves 1-2 years
   later. However, this decrease in glacier reserves causes significant
   increases in temperature in summer and autumn 1 year later as well as
   increases in precipitation in spring and autumn 2 years later. The
   trends and undulations of glacier reserves are controlled by temperature
   and winter precipitation, respectively. Glacier reserves are an
   important intermediate link in the transfer effect from winter
   precipitation to annual average temperature. Changes in glacier reserves
   show obvious periodicity, i.e., a ``crest-trough-crest{''} process, with
   climate change. The cumulative effect of the climate every 15 years may
   create a sudden drop in the glacier reserves, which lasts for 1-2 years.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown substantial declines in snow water equivalent
   (SWE) over much of the western United States in the last half century,
   as well as trends toward earlier spring snowmelt and peak spring
   streamflows. These trends are influenced both by interannual and
   decadal-scale climate variability, and also by temperature trends at
   longer time scales that are generally consistent with observations of
   global warming over the twentieth century. In this study, the linear
   trends in I April SWE over the western United States are examined, as
   simulated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model
   implemented at 1/8 degrees latitude-longitude spatial resolution, and
   driven by a carefully quality controlled gridded daily precipitation and
   temperature dataset for the period 1915-2003. The long simulations of
   snowpack are used as surrogates for observations and are the basis for
   an analysis of regional trends in snowpack over the western United
   States and southern British Columbia, Canada. By isolating the trends
   due to temperature and precipitation in separate simulations, the
   influence of temperature and precipitation variability on the overall
   trends in SWE is evaluated. Downward trends in 1 April SWE over the
   western United States from 1916 to 2003 and 1947 to 2003, and for a time
   series constructed using two warm Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)
   epochs concatenated together, are shown to be primarily due to
   widespread warming. These temperature-related trends are not well
   explained by decadal climate variability associated with the PDO. Trends
   in SWE associated with precipitation trends, however, are very different
   in different time periods and are apparently largely controlled by
   decadal variability rather than longer-term trends in climate.},

Abstract = {The northwest China, typical and and semi-arid regions, is the first or
   second-degree sensitivity zones for global change. Monitoring vegetation
   change is an important method to study the impacts of global climate
   change. Time-series satellite remote sensing data make it possible to
   monitor vegetation at different spatial and temporal resolutions
   globally. A long time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
   (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data with 8x8
   km(2) spatial resolution and during 1982 to 2003 were used to monitor
   the vegetation cover in the northwest China. The monitoring results
   indicate an obvious greening trend exists. The precipitation and
   relative humidity have high correlations with the SINDVI. So the water
   condition is the most important factors for the spatial distribution of
   the SINDVI levels. The precipitation and temperature are the primary
   driving factors for inter-annual vegetation changes.},

Abstract = {In southern South America and for the period 1960-2011, frequencies and
   trends of seasonal blocking situations (Bs) determined at 100, 70 and 40
   degrees W (B100, B70 and B40), respectively are estimated. The effect of
   such situations on temperature and precipitation is also analyzed. The
   distribution of occurrences of B100, B70 and B40 peaks in spring and has
   minimum values in summer; trends are positive in summer and fall and
   negative in winter and spring. To the north of approximately 38 degrees
   S, B70 determines negative temperature anomalies (DT) over the entire
   country during the four seasons and B40 in spring and summer. Except for
   summer, rainfall is greater than normal when Bs occur at both
   longitudes. To the south of approximately 38 degrees S, B100 give place
   to negative DT. The frequencies and amounts of precipitation are greater
   in spring. This area is limited to the northernmost northern
   (southernmost southern) area in fall (summer). According to the signs of
   the trends of the Bs and to the associated values of temperature and
   precipitation, the way in which they may have contributed to the change
   in both variables during 1960-2011 is inferred.},

Abstract = {As one of the most populated agricultural habitats in the world,
   Southeast Asia has been highly exposed to extremes of weather and
   climate, posing great importance to figure out the trend and variability
   characteristics of extremes over there. The annual extreme precipitation
   and temperature over Southeast Asia during 1981-2017 are analyzed in
   this study using datasets based on daily observations derived from
   thousands of meteorological stations. Results show that the wet extremes
   decrease over the areas surrounding the South China Sea and increase
   over the south of the Philippines and Indonesia with the most
   significant trends detected over the east of Indochina and New Guinea.
   Extreme high temperatures decrease significantly over the middle of New
   Guinea and increase over Indochina, Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan.
   Moreover, empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses show that the
   first principal components for most precipitation extremes are
   characterized by significant decadal changes relevant to the Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the second
   principal components exhibit significant interannual variability
   associated with oceanic systems such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO). As for temperature extremes, the leading EOF modes show
   non-significant trends or decadal variations, but significant
   interannual variations related to ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole are
   detected.},

Abstract = {Despite the recent popularity of studying the effects of climate change
   on critical regions worldwide, there is a paucity of data documenting
   the results from trend analysis for these regions based on
   hydro-climatic variables such as precipitation and temperature. The
   purpose of this study was to undertake a spatio-temporal precipitation
   and temperature trend analysis for the Seyhan and Ceyhan River Basins
   located in the south of Turkey. The data for the seasonal and annual
   temperature variations (minimum, maximum and mean) and the total
   precipitation outputs obtained from the 14 stations in these basins are
   considered. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall and the Mann-Kendall rank
   correlation tests are employed to determine the trend and its year of
   initiation. The linear slopes of the trends are calculated by using
   Sen's slope estimation technique and the spatial distributions for the
   slope of trends are presented. The results show that statistically
   significant upward trends exist for these basins based on the annual
   maximum temperature values, and the years of initiation of the trends
   are determined as mid-1990 and mid-2000.},

   were investigated for the period 1948-2012 across the southeastern
   United States using 27 previously defined indices. Results show that
   regionwide warming in extreme minimum temperatures and cooling in
   extreme maximum temperatures occurred. The disproportionate changes in
   extreme daytime and nighttime temperatures are narrowing diurnal
   temperature ranges for most locations. The intensity and magnitude of
   extreme precipitation events increased overall, except for more easterly
   locations, particularly in South Carolina. These indices further show
   that warming in minimum temperatures has been pronounced most in summer
   and least in winter. Fall has become significantly wetter, while spring
   and summer have become drier, on average. Principal component analysis
   (PCA) was used to characterize a ``geography of extremes{''} based on
   temperature and precipitation extreme indices. The PCA based on
   temperature indices revealed two coherent western and eastern subregions
   that share common modes of variability in extremes. Precipitation
   indices resulted in a greater number of smaller, spatially coherent
   groups exhibiting similar modes of variability. This classification
   regime illustrates important variations in extremes that exist on
   subregional scales. These findings have relevance for established
   climate research institutes, local governments, resource managers, and
   community planners interested in the variability of extreme events
   throughout the region.},

Abstract = {Monthly temperature and precipitation trends from 10 agricultural
   meteorological stations in China were analyzed over the years 1984-2008.
   Five major grape-producing provinces in China (Hebei, Liaoning,
   Shandong, Henan and Xinjiang) were chosen in this study. The results
   showed that warming trends were observed at all major grape growing
   regions. The trends of maximum (t(max)), mean (t(mean)) and minimum
   (t(min)) temperatures were markedly increased in Shandong
   (r(2)=0.705{*}{*}), Xinjiang (r(2)=0.608{*}{*}) and Hebei
   (r(2)=0.839{*}{*}), respectively. In addition, monthly temperature
   trends were strongest in March and December which showed highest trends
   in Liaoning and Xinjiang (0.35 and 0.57 degrees C/decade). Whereas
   precipitation (ppt) trends had remained stable in most of the grape
   growing regions and it had slightly increasing trends in Shandong
   (r(2)=0.142), while monthly ppt had more frequent droughts in summer and
   early autumn (June-September), particularly in Henan, Liaoning, and
   Xinjiang (-10.85, -5.56 and -3.99 mm/decade). For the climatic variable
   and yield variation (t/ha/y) in spring-summer (March-August) period,
   yield variations of all regions were not profoundly influenced by
   warming trends but they were significantly correlated with ppt trends.
   Therefore, it suggests that recent climate trends have had an implicit
   effect on grape yields in the major grape-producing regions in China.},

Abstract = {Climate change profoundly impacts agriculture system by changing
   variables such as rainfall, temperature, evapotranspiration, soil water
   content, and water availability. Henan provinece is ranked top among
   other provincs in China for agricultural production especially the
   winter wheat. As far, Climate change is affecting agricultural
   procedures greatly. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the
   variability of climatic extremes and trends of climatic parameters in
   Dongwan watershed, China. Twelve temperature (max. \& min.) and ten
   precipitation extreme indices were calculated using the RClimDex
   toolkit. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope (Q)
   estimator methods were applied to detect climate change trends and their
   magnitudes. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) technique was used to
   patterned the spatial variations in climatic variables. It was observed
   that the temperature increase showed a significant increase, especially
   the hot indices. Precipitation indices were not substantial but for few
   stations and few indexes. In the trend analysis, it was found that the
   extreme max. The temperature increased significantly during the study
   period. All through 1998-2014, the maximum temperature has amplified by
   1.1 degrees C as compared to 1979-1997. Similarly, precipitation also
   has increased by 46 mm in the second time step compared to the first.
   The change in temperature and precipitation may affect the crop water
   requirement, crop yield, and water availability in the Dongwan river
   watershed, impacting the Luhun, Sanmenxia, Guxian, and Xiaolangdi

Abstract = {New York State (NYS) is a geographically diverse area susceptible to
   climate change, but trends in climate extreme indicators have not been
   extensively studied. Our objectives are to describe temporal and spatial
   trends in various extreme indicators and their sensitivity to climate
   change and to demonstrate geographic differences in indicator trends in
   NYS. We analyzed data from the US Historical Climatology Network for NYS
   from 1948 to 2008. We assessed trends in 15 temperature and 11
   precipitation indicators using linear regression with bootstrapping in
   SAS and RClimDex software. The indicators showing the most substantial
   change per decade were frost days (-0.97 days per decade) and diurnal
   temperature (-0.11A degrees C). For precipitation indicators, the number
   of heavy precipitation days (+0.99 days), consecutive wet days (+ 0.42
   days), the total wet day precipitation (+30.19 mm), and the simple daily
   intensity index (+0.18 mm/day) showed the most change per decade. The
   most representative indicators that showed significant trends for more
   than half of the stations were number of cool nights, diurnal
   temperature, and number of frost days and increase in total wet day
   precipitation and simple daily intensity index for precipitation. The
   most sensitive regions for changes in extreme indicators were the
   eastern and Great Lakes regions of NYS. In light of these consistent
   temporal trends of warming and increasing precipitation in NYS with
   large geographic variation, the indicators that have been identified
   should be further evaluated and assessed for their health impact.
   Geographical differences in climate trends may be of use in informing
   policy and resource allocation for climate change adaptation.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes changes in the long-term (1901-2015) monthly values
   of potential evapotranspiration (PET), precipitation, and minimum (Tmin)
   and maximum (Tmax) temperatures across Africa to quantify trends and
   assess covariability between these climatic variables. Both warming and
   drying trends were observed across the continent. The 1979-2015 warming
   was stronger than that from 1901 to 1940. Some cooling occurred from
   1941 to the mid-1970s. The 1901-2015 annual Tmax, Tmin, and PET averaged
   over Africa exhibited increasing or drying trends across the continent
   at rates of 0.18 degrees C, 0.22 degrees C, and 3.5 mm per decade,
   respectively. The 1961-1990 annual precipitation averaged over the whole
   continent showed that Africa experienced drying at a rate of about -28
   mm per decade. When considering the period 1961-2015, the rate of
   precipitation decrease was about -8 mm per decade. From 1901 to 1915,
   areas around Lake Victoria in East Africa and along the western
   coastline south of the equator experienced wetting rates of up to 36 mm
   per decade. Significant (p < 0.01) warming trends occurred in Sudan,
   Southern and Northern Africa. Positive PET trends were significant (p <
   0.01) in the warm Mediterranean climate, and the western part of South
   Africa. Long-term temperature increase and precipitation decrease across
   northern Africa possibly indicated the Sahara Desert expansion over
   time. Except in the warm desert climate, the continent exhibited high
   precipitation variability. Equatorial climate experienced low
   temperature and PET variability. The strongest coherence between
   precipitation and temperature existed at multiple scales (6-8 years).
   Correlations between precipitation and PET (or temperature) were mostly
   negative and weak (p > 0.01). Because the sensitivity of T-min to local
   influences is higher than that of T-max, areas with strong negative
   correlation were larger in coverage for T-max than those of T-min. These
   results call for planned measures to tackle food insecurity in
   sub-Saharan Africa.},

Abstract = {Analysis of climate on regional scales has acquired special importance
   due to its ability to influence distribution and production of natural
   resources and food crops. There has been a long felt need for doing the
   climate variability studies at smaller units like sub-division or
   district, as causes of climate change are more global but there impacts
   are felt locally. Central India is uniquely known for its rich forest
   wealth, good agricultural production and being home to varied bio
   diversity. Large number of tribal people in Central India derives their
   livelihood and nutrition security from forest resources. Climate change
   is likely to impact the distribution of these natural resources by
   altering their phenology and production. This study was aimed to study
   the variation in climatic parameters (temperature and precipitation) at
   district level for multi-decadal (45 years) period in Western
   (Hoshangabad) and Eastern (Mandla) Madhya Pradesh. Mann-Kendall Test and
   Sen's Slope Estimator was used for studying the direction and magnitude
   of change in the selected parameters.
   Significant downward trends of Mean minimum temperature have been
   noticed at Mandla. Monsoon and post monsoon months are getting dried
   while pre-monsoon periods are becoming wetter. The rainfall records show
   a big shift in the total rains received at Hoshangabad. A westward shift
   in rainfall is seen in the state.},

Abstract = {Air temperature and precipitation data observed and recorded by the
   Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) from 1906 to 2005 were analyzed.
   Observed trends and correlations at 16 weather stations in urban and
   rural areas over Japan from Nemuro in the north (43.3(o)N) to Ishigaki
   in the south (24.3 N) were identified and quantified. Average annual
   values were emphasized in a previous analysis (Higashino and Stefan
   2014). Herein monthly values and extreme events at the daily and hourly
   timescale were extracted and interpreted. As shown in 2014, observed air
   temperature rises are much larger in urban than in rural areas and are
   statistically significant at all sites. Air temperature rises in Japan
   in the period 1906-2005 are strongest in spring (March, April, and May)
   and weakest in midsummer (July and August). Monthly air temperature
   rises have accelerated over time by a factor of about 3 from the period
   (1906-2005) to (1981-2005), except for a short period in August. In the
   period (1906-2005), daily minimum air temperature rises have occurred at
   all sites. Daily and yearly minimum air temperature trends are more than
   twice as strong as daily and yearly maximum temperature trends. The
   numbers of annual hot days and hot nights have also increased at most of
   the study sites in the period (1906-2005), but only the number of hot
   nights and the daily minimum air temperature are strongly correlated
   with annual average air temperature increases. The trends in the annual
   numbers of frost days and hot nights are well correlated with the annual
   average air temperature trend, one negative, the other positive, as to
   be expected. Trends in mean annual precipitation are very small, near
   zero for (1906-2005), mostly negative for 1956-2005, and mostly positive
   for 1981-2005. There is no correlation with trends in air temperature.
   Daily maximum precipitation for (1906-2005) and (1956-2005) shows only
   small and often non-statistically significant changes at the 16 study
   sites. In (1981-2005), trends have increased significantly but fluctuate
   significantly between positive and negative trends.},

Abstract = {To identify whether the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature
   extremes and precipitation extremes has changed in central and eastern
   China including Henan, Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, the
   spatial and temporal distributions of extreme temperature and
   precipitation indices trends during 1961-2011 were investigated and
   analysed. To guarantee the accuracy of trend analysis, daily maximum and
   minimum surface temperature and daily precipitation from 299
   meteorological stations were used. Eight extreme temperature indices and
   seven extreme precipitation indices were chosen. Mann-Kendall method was
   used to check the statistical significance of trends, while Sen's
   nonparametric method was used to calculate the trend magnitudes. The
   analyses of extreme temperature indices detected significant and stable
   trends in the majority of the stations, especially for the most part of
   southern Anhui and southern Jiangsu provinces. The strongly stable
   downward trends in cold extremes and the strongly stable upward trends
   in hot extremes were recorded in most of the regions. In contrast,
   significant and stable positive trends were insignificantly recorded for
   precipitation extremes in the study area, which predominantly occurred
   in the southern part of the region. Furthermore, the positive trends
   were more frequent than the negative trends in most extreme
   precipitation indices. The results may provide a reference for a more
   particular knowledge of the climate change in this region and provide
   guidance for agriculture development.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate variability in precipitation and air
   temperature data of all provinces in Turkey. The innovative trend pivot
   analysis method (ITPAM) was used to analyze the trend in precipitation
   (mm) and air temperature (degrees C) data of Turkey in this study.
   Analyzing the country as a whole using this method is one of the
   strengths of the study. In the study, 30-year datasets between 1991 and
   2020 were analyzed. As a result of the study, trend analysis results of
   precipitation and air temperature data of 81 provinces in Turkey were
   obtained. The significance level in trends was determined as 5\%. In
   this study, 41\% of the monthly total precipitation data of Turkey
   showed an increasing trend, 41\% showed a decreasing trend, while 18\%
   showed no trend. In the standard deviation of precipitation data, 44\%
   of the data showed an increasing trend, 42\% showed a decreasing trend
   and 14\% showed no trend. In addition, it was concluded that there was
   an increasing trend of 67\% in the monthly average air temperature data
   and an increasing trend of 46\% in the standard deviation data.
   According to these results, it is concluded that monthly average air
   temperature data have a largely increasing trend.},

Title = {Recent trends in observed temperature and precipitation extremes in the
   Yangtze River basin, China},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1-4},
Pages = {139-151},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The present study is an analysis of the observed extreme temperature and
   precipitation trends over Yangtze from 1960 to 2002 on the basis of the
   daily data from 108 meteorological stations. The intention is to
   identify whether or not the frequency or intensity of extreme events has
   increased with climate warming over Yangtze River basin in the last 40
   years. Both the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test and simple linear
   regression were utilized to detect monotonic trends in annual and
   seasonal extremes.
   Trend tests reveal that the annual and seasonal mean maximum and minimum
   temperature trend is characterized by a positive trend and that the
   strongest trend is found in the winter mean minimum in the Yangtze.
   However, the observed significant trend on the upper Yangtze reaches is
   less than that found on the middle and lower Yangtze reaches and for the
   mean maximum is much less than that of the mean minimum. From the
   basin-wide point of view, significant increasing trends are observed in
   1-day extreme temperature in summer and winter minimum, but there is no
   significant trend for 1-day maximum temperature. Moreover, the number of
   cold days <= 0 degrees C and <= -10 degrees C shows significant
   decrease, while the number of hot days (daily value >= 35 degrees C)
   shows only a minor decrease. The upward trends found in the winter
   minimum temperature in both the mean and the extreme value provide
   evidence of the warming-up of winter and of the weakening of temperature
   extremes in the Yangtze in last few decades.
   The monsoon climate implies that precipitation amount peaks in summer as
   does the occurrence of heavy rainfall events. While the trend test has
   revealed a significant trend in summer rainfall, no statistically
   significant change was observed in heavy rain intensity. The 1-day,
   3-day and 7-day extremes show only a minor increase from a basin-wide
   point of view. However, a significant positive trend was found for the
   number of rainstorm days (daily rainfall >= 50 mm). The increase of
   rainstorm frequency, rather than intensity, on the middle and lower
   reaches contributes most to the positive trend in summer precipitation
   in the Yangtze.},

Abstract = {The increasing temperature in an urban area has adversely affected the
   Earth's environment, human health and has been a subject of prior
   considerable attention. Hence, for the sustainable development and
   adaptation of the urban population to climate change, it is essential to
   find the trend and magnitude of temperature and precipitation over
   Indian cities. An endeavor has been made in the present study to find
   the trend and magnitude of temperature and precipitation over 139 major
   Indian cities with respect to different Koppen climatic zones using
   Climatic Research Unit datasets of last 115 years (1901-2015). The
   annual and seasonal trend and magnitude of temperature and precipitation
   of these cities were assessed using non-parametrical modified
   Mann-Kendall and Sens's slope test. The results indicate that the annual
   and seasonal temperature trend was significantly deceasing over the
   cities of north western region whereas an increasing trend in the south
   eastern cities of India. A significant relationship was observed between
   temperature and precipitation in the hot steppe (BSh), dry winter humid
   subtropical (Cwa) and tropical wet and dry (Aw) climatic zone. The
   distribution of precipitation trend is highly heterogeneous and uneven
   as compared to temperature. The eastern part of India shows decreasing
   precipitation trend in comparison with the western part.},

Abstract = {Eurasia is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change in the
   world. Its western and eastern coasts are very likely to exhibit
   different temperature and precipitation variations in response to the
   global climate change. By using precipitation (PRCP), maximum
   temperature (T-max), minimum temperature (T-min), and daily temperature
   range (DTR) data from 333 meteorological stations in Western (WE) and
   Eastern Eurasia (EE), we quantitatively compared spatio-temporal changes
   on both the seasonal and annual scales from 1961 to 2012. Results showed
   that PRCP mainly exhibited increasing trends in northern WE and
   decreasing trends in southern WE, whereas PRCP in EE recorded an
   increase-decrease-increase trend from high to low latitudes. The
   increase of annual PRCP in WE was higher than that in EE. On the
   seasonal scale, the PRCP in WE recorded an opposite trend from EE. T-max
   and T-min significantly increased for almost all stations on the annual
   and seasonal scales, especially during the winter. Nevertheless, the
   increase of T-min was higher than that of T-max in EE, resulting in a
   decreased DTR on both the seasonal and annual scales. An reverse trend
   of DTR was detected in WE. Our results concluded that the Arctic
   Oscillation was the major large-scale atmospheric circulation affecting
   the trends of PRCP (negative correlation) and temperature (positive
   correlation) over WE and EE, and it might play an important role in
   future climate change.},

Title = {Temperature and precipitation at migratory grounds influence demographic

Abstract = {Anthropogenic climate disruption, including temperature and
   precipitation regime shifts, has been linked to animal population
   declines since the mid-20th century. However, some species, such as
   Arctic-breeding geese, have thrived during this period. An increased
   understanding of how climate disruption might link to demographic rates
   in thriving species is an important perspective in quantifying the
   impact of anthropogenic climate disruption on the global state of
   nature. The Greenland barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) population has
   increased tenfold in abundance since the mid-20th century. A concurrent
   weather regime shift towards warmer, wetter conditions occurred
   throughout its range in Greenland (breeding), Ireland and Scotland
   (wintering) and Iceland (spring and autumn staging). The aim of this
   study was to determine the relationship between weather and demographic
   rates of Greenland barnacle geese to discern the role of climate shifts
   in the population trend. We quantified the relationship between
   temperature and precipitation and Greenland barnacle goose survival and
   productivity over a 50 year period from 1968 to 2018. We detected
   significant positive relationships between warmer, wetter conditions on
   the Icelandic spring staging grounds and survival. We also detected
   contrasting relationships between warmer, wetter conditions during
   autumn staging and survival and productivity, with warm, dry conditions
   being the most favourable for productivity. Survival increased in the
   latter part of the study period, supporting the possibility that spring
   weather regime shifts contributed to the increasing population trend.
   This may be related to improved forage resources, as warming air
   temperatures have been shown to improve survival rates in several other
   Arctic and northern terrestrial herbivorous species through indirect
   bottom-up effects on forage availability.},

Title = {Short-Term Precipitation and Temperature Trends along an Elevation
   Gradient in Northeastern Puerto Rico},
Journal = {EARTH INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As is true of many tropical regions, northeastern Puerto Rico is an
   ecologically sensitive area with biological life that is highly
   elevation dependent on precipitation and temperature. Climate change has
   the potential to increase the risk of losing endemic species and
   habitats. Consequently, it is important to explore the pattern of trends
   in precipitation and temperature along an elevation gradient.
   Statistical derivatives of a frequently sampled dataset of precipitation
   and temperature at 20 sites along an elevation gradient of 1000m in
   northeastern Puerto Rico were examined for trends from 2001 to 2013 with
   nonparametric methods accounting for annual periodic variations such as
   yearly weather cycles. Overall daily precipitation had an increasing
   trend of around 0.1 mm day(-1) yr(-1). The driest months of the annual
   dry, early, and late rainfall seasons showed a small increasing trend in
   the precipitation (around 0.1 mm day(-1) yr(-1)). There was strong
   evidence that precipitation in the driest months of each rainfall season
   increased faster at higher elevations (0.02 mm day(-1) more increase for
   100-m elevation gain) and some evidence for the same pattern in
   precipitation in all months of the year but at half the rate.
   Temperature had a positive trend in the daily minimum (around 0.028
   degrees C yr(-1)) and a negative trend in the daily maximum whose size
   is likely an order of magnitude larger than the size of the daily
   minimum trend. Physical mechanisms behind the trends may be related to
   climate change; longer-term studies will need to be undertaken in order
   to assess the future climatic trajectory of tropical forests.},

Title = {Temperature and precipitation trends and their links with elevation in
   the Hengduan Mountain region, China},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {75},
Number = {2},
Pages = {163-180},
Abstract = {Annual, seasonal, and monthly changes in temperature and precipitation
   and their links with elevation in the Hengduan Mountain region (HDMR) in
   China were analyzed based on the daily climate data of 90 meteorological
   stations from 1961-2011. The results demonstrate that the average annual
   mean temperature in the HDMR exhibited significant increasing trends of
   0.16 degrees C decade(-1) during 1961-2011. The warming trends were
   found to be more apparent in winter (December-January-February) and
   autumn (September-October-November) than in summer (June-July-August)
   and spring (March-April-May). All of the 12 monthly mean temperatures
   increased, with trends ranging from 0.01-0.24 degrees C per 10 yr.
   Temperatures increased by 0.06 degrees C per 10 yr per 1000 m for
   elevations ranging from 500-4000 m. The elevation dependency of climatic
   warming was most robust in winter followed by spring and summer, and was
   weakest in autumn. The magnitudes of the monthly temperature changes
   ranged from 0.02-0.10 degrees C per 10 yr per 1000 m. The relationships
   between annual, seasonal, and monthly temperature trends and elevation
   indicate evidence of elevation-dependent warming. The average annual
   total precipitation showed a nonsignificant decreasing trend of -11.41
   mm decade(-1) in the HDMR from 1961-2011. Summer, autumn, and winter
   precipitation showed nonsignificant decreasing trends during 1961-2011,
   while spring precipitation exhibited an increasing trend at a rate of
   7.34 mm decade(-1). The HDMR exhibited a wetting trend during January to
   May and a drying trend during June to December. The annual and seasonal
   precipitation changes showed positive correlations with elevation, but
   annual and seasonal precipitation decreased, except for the spring
   precipitation (which increased significantly). The relationships between
   annual and seasonal precipitation trends and elevation indicate that the
   higher altitude regions experienced a slower drying trend than regions
   at a lower altitude. The spring precipitation increasing trend was
   amplified with elevation. This study will be helpful for improving our
   understanding of the variabilities in temperature and precipitation in
   response to climate change, and will provide support for water resource
   management in the HDMR.},

   that monthly sea level pressure variability accounts for much of the
   short-term variations of temperature over most of the domain and of
   precipitation in certain regions. Removing the effect of atmospheric
   circulation through a regression approach reconciles the observed

   have been increasing significantly since the late 1970s, (2) drought
   severity and frequency have increased with time, and (3) the
   precipitation distribution has become more extreme over time. We discuss
   the implications of these trends within the context of regional and

   (AMSU-A) observations from a series of National Oceanic and Atmospheric

   modulate MSU and AMSU-A brightness temperatures. In this study, the
   effects of the radiation from clouds and precipitation on AMSU-A derived
   atmospheric temperature trend are assessed using the information from
   AMSU-A window channels. It is shown that the global mean temperature in
   the low and middle troposphere has a larger warming rate (about 20-30 \%
   higher) when the cloud-affected radiances are removed from AMSU-A data.
   It is also shown that the inclusion of cloud-affected radiances in the
   trend analysis can significantly offset the stratospheric cooling
   represented by AMSU-A channel 9 over the middle and high latitudes of

Abstract = {The Loess Plateau is the most severe soil and water loss area in the
   world. The changing trends of annual mean temperature and annual
   precipitation over the last 50 years in the Loess Plateau Region (LPR)
   are investigated using observed time series from all available stations.
   The trends are assessed for both the entire LPR and its five integrated
   management divisions using the gridded data. It is shown that the
   region-averaged annual mean temperature has significantly increased over
   the last 50 years (1.91 degrees C/50 yr), whereas the region-averaged
   annual precipitation shows a non-significant negative trend (-29.11
   mm/50 yr). Spatially, there is an enhanced warming gradient but an
   obvious drying to weak wetting gradient from the southeast to the
   northwest across the region. On divisional scales, a significant warming
   trend is detected for all the divisions. A significant drying trend and
   a nearly significant drying trend are found for the first and second
   divisions, respectively, and a non-significant positive trend for other
   divisions. Therefore the region can be divided into the southeast
   warming and drying sub-region (SESR) and the northwest warming and weak
   wetting sub-region (NWSR). Further analysis shows that the SESR has a
   significant warming trend (1.71 degrees C/50 yr) and a significant
   drying trend (-47.62 mm/50 yr), and the NWSR has a significant warming
   trend (2.25 degrees C/50 yr) but a non-significant wetting trend (1520
   mm/50 yr). These results may have important implication in addressing
   the challenge of climate change in terms of the integrated management of
   the LPR. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A mismatch between model-and proxy-based Holocene climate change, known
   as the ``Holocene conundrum{''}, may partially originate from the poor
   spatial coverage of climate reconstructions in, for example, Asia,
   limiting the number of grid cells for model-data comparisons. Here we
   investigate hemispheric, latitudinal, and regional mean time series and
   time-slice anomaly maps of pollen-based reconstructions of mean annual
   temperature, mean July temperature, and annual precipitation from 1908
   records in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. Temperature trends show
   strong latitudinal patterns and differ between (sub-)continents. While
   the circum-Atlantic regions in Europe and eastern North America show a
   pronounced Middle Holocene temperature maximum, western North America
   shows only weak changes, and Asia mostly shows a continuous Holocene
   temperature increase. Likewise, precipitation trends show certain
   regional peculiarities such as the pronounced Middle Holocene
   precipitation maximum between 40 and 50(?) N in Asia and Holocene
   increasing trends in Europe and western North America, which can all be
   linked with Holocene changes in the regional circulation pattern
   responding to temperature change. Given a background of strong regional
   heterogeneity, we conclude that the calculation of global or hemispheric
   means, which initiated the Holocene conundrum debate, should focus more
   on understanding the spatiotemporal patterns and their regional drivers.},

Journal = {POLAR SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The study of Antarctic precipitation has attracted a lot of attention
   recently. The reliability of climate models in simulating Antarctic
   precipitation, however, is still debatable. This work assess the
   precipitation and surface air temperature (SAT) of Antarctica (90
   degrees S to 60 degrees S) using 49 Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models and the European Centre
   for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ``Interim{''} reanalysis
   (ERA-Interim); the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate
   Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR); the Japan Meteorological Agency
   55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55); and the Modern Era Retrospective-analysis
   for Research and Applications (MERRA) datasets for 1979-2005 (27 years).
   For precipitation, the time series show that the MERRA and JRA-55 have
   significantly increased from 1979 to 2005, while the ERA-Int and CFSR
   have insignificant changes. The reanalyses also have low correlation
   with one another (generally less than + 0.69). 37 CMIP5 models show
   increasing trend, 18 of which are significant. The resulting CMIP5 MMM
   also has a significant increasing trend of 0.29 +/- 0.06 mm year(-1).
   For SAT, the reanalyses show insignificant changes and have high
   correlation with one another, while the CMIP5 MMM shows a significant
   increasing trend. Nonetheless, the variability of precipitation and SAT
   of MMM could affect the significance of its trend. One of the many
   reasons for the large differences of precipitation is the CMIP5 models'
   resolution.},

Abstract = {The present study is mainly concerned with the changing trends of
   rainfall and temperature of all the thirteen districts of the state
   Uttarakhand. The state lies on the southern slope of the Himalayan range
   and the climate and vegetation vary greatly with elevation, from the
   glaciers at the highest elevations to subtropical forests at lower
   elevations. In the present study, we have tried to analyze the most
   important climatic variables precipitation and temperature, for
   analyzing the trend in the area. For this, daily rainfall data of 41
   years from 1971 to 2011 and minimum and maximum temperature data of 37
   years from 1971 to 2007 has been processed in the study to find out the
   monthly variability of rainfall and temperature for which Mann-Kendall
   (MK) Test has been used together with the Sen's Slope Estimator for the
   determination of trend and slope magnitude. Monthly precipitation and
   temperature trend has been identified here to achieve the objective
   which has been shown by 41and 37 years of data. There are increasing
   trends of precipitation and temperature in some months and decreasing
   trends in some other months for all the thirteen districts of
   Uttarakhand obtained from these statistical tests suggesting overall
   insignificant changes in the area.},

Title = {Historical and projected trends in temperature and precipitation
   extremes in Australia in observations and CMIP5},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {34-56},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study expands previous work on climate extremes in Australia by
   investigating the simulation of a large number of extremes indices in
   the CMIP5 multi-model dataset and comparing them to multiple
   observational datasets over a century of observed data using consistent
   methods. We calculate 24 indices representing extremes of temperature
   and precipitation from 1911 to 2010 over Australia and show that there
   have been significant observed trends in temperature extremes associated
   with warming while there have been few significant observed trends in
   precipitation extremes. We compare the observed indices calculated from
   two mostly independent datasets with 22 CMIP5 models to determine how
   well global climate models are able to simulate observed climatologies,
   variability and trends. We find that generally temperature extremes are
   reasonably well simulated (climatology, variability and trend patterns)
   although the models tend to overestimate minimum temperature extremes
   and underestimate maximum temperature extremes. Some models stand out as
   being outliers and we exclude one model (INMCM4) entirely from the
   multi-model analysis as it simulates unrealistic minimum temperature
   extremes over the historical period. There is more spread between models
   for precipitation than temperature extremes but in most cases the
   observations sit within the model spread. Exceptions are consecutive wet
   days (CWD) where nearly all models overestimate the actual number of
   annual wet days and simple daily intensity (SDII) and one day
   precipitation maxima (Rx1day) where the models tend to underestimate
   precipitation intensity. However, some of these differences likely lie
   in observational uncertainty. Most models including the multi-model mean
   indicate that precipitation intensity has increased over the last
   century but the two observational datasets analysed disagree on the sign
   of change of precipitation intensity, one of them indicating a
   significant decrease. We use the CMIP5 simulations for two future
   Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5)
   to project changes in temperature and precipitation extremes across
   Australia. By the end of the century the number of cold temperature
   extremes substantially reduces and the number of warm temperature
   extremes substantially increases; changes scaling relative to the
   strength of emissions scenario. Changes in temperature extremes are
   often greatest in the tropics. While the results for precipitation
   extremes are less marked, simulations for the end of the century
   compared to present day indicate more periods of dryness while the most
   intense precipitation extremes increase substantially, with a separation
   becoming clear between emissions scenarios.},

Title = {Changes in Canada's Climate: Trends in Indices Based on Daily
   Temperature and Precipitation Data},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {Trends in indices based on daily temperature and precipitation are
   examined for two periods: 1948-2016 for all stations in Canada and
   1900-2016 for stations in the south of Canada. These indices, a number
   of which reflect extreme events, are considered to be impact relevant.
   The results show changes consistent with warming, with larger trends
   associated with cold temperatures. The number of summer days (when daily
   maximum temperature >25 degrees C) has increased at most locations south
   of 65 degrees N, and the number of hot days (daily maximum temperature
   >30 degrees C) and hot nights (daily minimum temperature >22 degrees C)
   have increased at a few stations in the most southerly regions. Very
   warm temperatures in both summer and winter (represented by the 95th
   percentile of their daily maximum and minimum temperatures,
   respectively) have increased across the country, with stronger trends in
   winter. Warming is more pronounced for cold temperatures. The frost-free
   season has become longer with fewer frost days, consecutive frost days,
   and ice days. Very cold temperatures in both winter and summer
   (represented by the 5th percentile of their daily maximum and minimum
   temperatures, respectively) have increased substantially across the
   country, again with stronger trends in the winter. Changes in other
   temperature indices are consistent with warming. The growing season is
   now longer, and the number of growing degree-days has increased. The
   number of heating degree-days has decreased across the country, while
   the number of cooling degree-days has increased at many stations south
   of 55 degrees N. The frequency of annual and spring freeze-thaw days
   shows an increase in the interior provinces and a decrease in the
   remainder of the country. Changes in precipitation indices are less
   spatially coherent. An increase in the number of days with rainfall and
   heavy rainfall is found at several locations in the south. A decrease in
   the number of days with snowfall and heavy snowfall is observed in the
   western provinces, while an increase is found in the north. There is no
   evidence of significant changes in the annual highest 1-day rainfall and
   1-day snowfall. The maximum number of consecutive dry days has
   decreased, mainly in the south.},

Title = {Trends in the consecutive days of temperature and precipitation extremes
   in China during 1961-2015},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {161},
Pages = {381-391},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background and aims: Consecutive climatic extremes have more intense
   impacts on natural ecosystems and human activities than occasional
   events. There were many studies about the frequency or intensity of
   extreme weather events, but few focused on the consecutiveness or
   continuousness of climatic extremes. We analyzed the temporal and
   spatial distributions and tendencies in the consecutive temperature and
   precipitation extremes in China during 1961-2015.
   Methods: Daily temperature and precipitation data at 1867 meteorological
   stations over China was used and four consecutive indices of climate
   extremes, i.e. cold spell duration indicator (CSDI), warm spell duration
   indicator (WSDI), consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days
   (CWD), were calculated by RClimDex 1.0. Linear trends in the time series
   of consecutive days of temperature and precipitation extremes were
   examined and their statistical significance was evaluated using
   Mann-Kendall test.
   Results and discussion: There were obvious differences in the spatial
   distributions of consecutive days of climate extremes in China. During
   1961-2015, CSDI and CWD decreased significantly at rates of 0.9 and 0.1
   days per decade respectively, while WSDI increased significantly at rate
   of 0.8 days per decade in China. Spatially, CSDI decreased at rates of
   0-3.0 days per decade in almost all parts of China, and WSDI increased
   at rates of 0-2.0 days per decade in most parts of China. The spatial
   trends of CDD and CWD were significant only in several regions of China.
   CSDI and WSDI had higher percent changes than those of CDD and CWD.
   Changes in the CSDI and WSDI were associated with large-scale oceanic
   and atmospheric circulation oscillations, such as Atlantic Multidecadal
   Oscillation (AMO), El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific
   Decadal Oscillation (PDO). With global warming, there will be fewer cold
   extremes, more frequent hot extremes and precipitation extremes.
   Conclusions: Given the increases in the frequency and intensity of some
   consecutive climatic extremes and an increasing physical exposure and
   socio-economic vulnerability to such extremes in China, more strategies
   and capacities of mitigation and adaptation to consecutive climatic
   extremes are essential for the local government and climate-sensitive
   sectors.},

Abstract = {The change of temperature and weather parameters is a major concern
   affecting sustainable development and impacting various sectors, such as
   agriculture, tourism, and industry. Changing weather patterns and their
   impact on water resources are important climatic factors that society is
   facing. In Thailand, climatological features such as ambient
   temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation play a substantial
   role in affecting extreme weather events, which cause damage to the
   economy, agriculture, tourism, and livelihood of people. To investigate
   recent serious changes in annual trends of temperature, relative
   humidity, and precipitation in Thailand, this study used the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test and innovative trend analysis (ITA) methods. The
   MK test showed that all six regions had an upward trend in temperature
   and humidity index (humidex, how hot the weather feels to the average
   person), while relative humidity and precipitation showed both upward
   and downward trends across different regions. The ITA method further
   confirmed the upward trend in temperature and humidex and showed that
   most data points fell above the 1:1 line. However, the upward trend in
   most variables was not significant at the 5\% level. The southern and
   eastern regions showed a significant upward trend in relative humidity
   and humidex at a 5\% level of significance according to the MK test. The
   output of this study can help in the understanding of weather variations
   and predict future situations and can be used for adaptation strategies.},

Abstract = {The trend analysis of annual temperature (daily average) and total
   precipitation has been conducted for 14 stations located in the Aegean
   Region, Turkey. The Sen, Spearman's rho, and Mann-Kendall test methods
   are used in the detection of the historical trends in the region. The
   Pettitt test is also implemented to find the significance of the trend,
   while the Theil-Sen approach is applied to detect the change point(s) in
   the time series. Findings of the following study indicate that both
   precipitation and temperature time series in the selected stations
   depict statistically significant trends with increasing nature. The rate
   of increase in precipitation and temperature by the Theil-Sen test is
   found to be 4.2-7.9 mm/year and 0.20-0.35 degrees C/decade,
   respectively. It is also found that the turn points of the temperature
   trends determined by the Pettitt test occurred in 1998 for all the
   stations. According to the results, the magnitude of the extreme events
   would change in the future, which may help in conceptualizing the
   framework and the resilience of the infrastructures against climate
   change.},

Abstract = {Trends in extreme temperature and rainfall were analyzed for two
   Caribbean islands in close proximity: Tobago (Crown Point) and Trinidad
   (Piarco) for the most recent period 1985-2015 using daily data. Most
   annual extreme temperature indices at Crown Point show no significant
   warming. However, warming at Crown Point manifests during the wet season
   and strongly in September. In contrast, most extreme temperature indices
   at Piarco show significant warming trends on annual and seasonal scales
   as well as for most months. Extreme precipitation indices show few
   trends. For Crown Point, trends indicate an increase in annual
   precipitation totals and extremely wet days were observed, whereas no
   significant trends in annual indices were found for Piarco. The greatest
   5-day rainfall amounts were found to increase during the dry season at
   both sites. When compared to previous regional studies, this specific
   territory approach highlights that most indices with no significant
   regional trends also do not show trends at the local scale. Furthermore,
   differences in trends between these two nearby sites, 80km apart,
   indicate that there is a spatial variation in warming trends.},

Abstract = {Aridity is a major indicator for defining the area of land that is prone
   to drought, land degradation, and desertification. The present research
   explores spatiotemporal variations of aridity using four different
   equations: (1) de Martonne aridity index (IDM); (2) Thornthwaite aridity
   index (AI); (3) moisture coefficient by V. I. Mezentsev (MI) and (4)
   Hydrothermal coefficient by Selyaninov (HTC) over Mongolia based on the
   primary climatic data from 70 different stations in Mongolia for the
   last 55 years (1961-2015). Utilizing these data using RegCM4-HadGEM
   climate change scenario, this study explores how the aridity level is
   likely to change in the future. The results showed that the total area
   of drylands (i.e., hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid and sub-humid regions)
   determined by IDM, MI, AI and HTC is approximately 64.1\%, 70.7\%, 85\%,
   and 98\%, respectively. Out of the four aridity indices considered, the
   metrics defined by AI and MI showed high correlation with the NDVI
   derived dryland regions. Time series analysis of AI and MI both showed a
   decreasing tendency for the period of 1961-2015. In the central and the
   northeastern regions in Mongolia, significantly decreasing trends in the
   aridity indices were observed. With respect to the stations with
   significantly decreasing trends in aridity, the relative changes of the
   aridity index magnitude varied between 14\% and 74\%. The aridity index
   calculated using climate change scenarios also indicated that the
   aridity level is likely to increase in the twenty-first century in the
   central part of Mongolia, whilst the extra arid areas will stable. The
   study has implications for water resources management, agriculture and
   social and economic life of the people of Mongolia and the other regions
   globally where aridity presents a significant challenge for decision
   makers.},

Title = {Trend analysis and forecast of annual precipitation and temperature
   series in the Eastern Mediterranean region},
Journal = {ATMOSFERA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {381-408},
Abstract = {The present study aims to examine the current trend of annual
   precipitation and temperature series referred to the Eastern
   Mediterranean basin on a national basis, including the annual
   variability of sea surface temperature anomalies and the connection
   effect with the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Mediterranean
   Oscillation indices (NAOI and MOI, respectively). The period under
   consideration is mainly the last 32 years, from 1990 to 2021.
   Additionally, the prediction of monthly and yearly temperature and
   precipitation series, based on the autoregressive integrated moving
   average model on a national base, for the next four or eight years, is
   another interesting feature of the present study. Results indicate
   rising trends in the annual precipitation during 1990-2021, mostly
   non-significant and significant warming trends in the annual
   temperature, including sea surface temperature. The NAOI is highly
   correlated mostly with annual temperature, whereas the MOI does not
   affect the variation of annual precipitation and temperature. The
   results of the present study are in general agreement with the results
   of available studies in the literature, and they could be of high
   interest to national authorities and environmental unions/organizations,
   to help decision-makers face climate change.},

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal trends of 11 (7) temperature (precipitation)
   extreme indices are examined for the Loess Plateau Region (LPR) and its
   southeast and northwest sub-regions based on daily observations at 214
   meteorological stations. Results show widespread significant warming
   trends for all the temperature extremes except for the diurnal
   temperature range (DTR) and the lowest daily maximum temperature in each
   year (TXn) during 1961-2010. When regionally averaged, a significant
   warming trend is detected for all the indices except for DTR and TXn in
   the past 50 years. Compared with the entire LPR, a significant warming
   trend is detected for all the indices except for DTR and TXn over the
   southeast sub-region of LPR; while it is observed for all the indices
   over the northwest. The trends for these indices are generally stronger
   in the northwest than in the southeast in the past 50 years. In
   contrast, for precipitation indices, only a small percentage of areas
   show significant drying or wetting trends and, when regionally averaged,
   none of them displays significant trends during the past 50 years. On
   the sub-regional scale, however, a larger percentage of areas show
   significant drying trends for precipitation indices generally over the
   southeast relative to the entire LPR, and noticeably, the sub-regional
   average heavy precipitation (R10mm) and wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT)
   display significant decreasing trends during the past 50 years; whereas
   only a slightly larger percentage of areas show significant wetting
   trends for these indices over the northwest compared with the entire
   LPR, and when sub-regionally averaged, none of the indices have
   significant trends during the past 50 years.},

Abstract = {The fundamentals of Chaos theory allow the study of climatic conditions
   and long-term modifications produced by changes in their spatial and
   temporal scales. The aim of this work is to analyse the variability and
   changes produced in the annual cycles of temperature and precipitation
   in Northern Patagonia, Argentina, applying multifractal analysis as a
   practical mathematical tool of Chaos theory. Data from the NASA POWER
   Project (2021) was implemented as an alternative dataset for carrying
   out climatological studies in the area. Annual mean temperature and
   precipitation time-series data (1981-2019) were analysed at 72 grid
   points with 1 degrees of spatial resolution. The Mann-Kendall test was
   used to calculate the trends through the annual cycles of the
   meteorological variables. Fractal dimension values were calculated using
   Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. The Hurst exponent,
   complexity and asymmetry were the multifractal dimensions describing the
   persistence of time-series trends and climatic variability. The results
   showed changes in the annual cycles of both variables during the study
   period. The most significant finding was a large area in the centre and
   north of the study area, where the decrease in the rainfall regime was
   persistent. The Hurst exponent detected a sector in the Patagonian Andes
   mountain range where the temperature increase was constant. This work
   demonstrates that fractal geometry is useful to describe meteorological
   variability and obtain better short-, medium- and long-term forecasts.},

Title = {Climate trends of temperature, precipitation and river discharge in the
   Volta Basin of West Africa},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-30},
Abstract = {The impact of climate change on precipitation and water availability is
   of major concern for policy makers in the Volta Basin of West Africa,
   whose economy mainly depends on rainfed agriculture and hydropower
   generation. It is therefore essential to know if, and to which extent
   climate trends in the Volta Basin exist that impact water availability.
   In this study, the present trends in precipitation, temperature, and
   river discharge for the Volta Basin were analysed. Linear trend and
   corresponding levels of significance were calculated for time series of
   annual and monthly maxima and corresponding means respectively. Trends
   of total annual precipitation and standard deviations for all considered
   variables were analysed. In addition, the stability of linear trends was
   considered via reverse arrangement test. Clear positive trends with high
   levels of significance were found for temperature time series.
   Precipitation time series showed both positive and negative trends,
   whereas most significant trends were negative. However, due to the small
   number of significant cases, only weak trends towards a decrease in
   precipitation can be concluded. Most of the significant trends of the
   standard deviation in precipitation were negative. Due to this
   observation a trend towards a decrease in the variability of
   precipitation is concluded. In case of discharge time series, a small
   amount of (predominantly positive) significant trends for the wet season
   was observed. The majority of the significant trends for the dry season
   were negative. For discharge no clear trend could be evaluated though,
   as the anthropogenic influences (e.g. building of dams, intensified
   irrigation) could not be quantified. Both, standard deviation of
   temperature and of river discharge show positive and negative
   significant trends. Thus one can not draw the conclusion of a change in
   temperature and river discharge variability.
   It is additionally shown that monthly precipitation trends can be weakly
   linked to climate indices. This was achieved by linear correlation
   analysis between monthly precipitation amounts and the climate indices

Abstract = {Covering sixty years (1955-2016), this paper analyzed the
   spatio-temporal trends of daily annual and seasonal means of
   precipitation, temperature, and extreme climate indices. The long-term
   decadel change analysis was carried out in two timeframes for
   consecutive analysis periods of 1955-1985 and 1986-2016 to capture the
   relative regional variations. The trends were evaluated using the
   modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) and Sen's slope (SS) statistical tests. The
   pattern visualized on maps was assessed for regions and districts
   located in the four states of the Indian Himalayan Region. The results
   revealed significant increases in the annual mean precipitation (1.61
   mm/year) and temperature (0.07 degrees/year) in Uttarakhand, followed by
   Himachal Pradesh from 1986 to 2016. The seasonal monsoonal precipitation
   showed a significantly increasing trend in parts of Himachal Pradesh,
   followed by Uttarakhand. The maximum and minimum temperature values
   increased in all the states, increasing temperature extremes.
   Significant trends in climate indices were observed in the second period
   of analysis. A rise of 0.02 degrees C/year in temperature extremes was
   observed in Uttarakhand. There is a progressive rise in precipitation
   indices, specifically in Uttarakhand (0.49 mm/year), and a drop in cold
   extremes with an increase of hot events in most states. The
   spatio-temporal variations were driven by multiple dominant mechanisms
   like orography, anthropogenic activities, land-use changes,
   teleconnections, and the emission of greenhouse gases. This study
   highlights the influence of climate change in different divisions of the
   Himalayas.},

Title = {Observed trends and future projections of precipitation and air
   temperature in the Lake Winnipeg watershed},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {72-82},
Abstract = {While the cause of eutrophication in Lake Winnipeg is known to be excess
   nutrient loading from watershed sources, few comprehensive studies have
   attempted to quantify the effects of changes in temperature and
   precipitation on the hydrological and nutrient transport regimes in the
   region. In this paper, results of spatial and temporal analyses of
   observed and regional climate model (RCM) projections of precipitation
   and air-temperature regimes within the Lake Winnipeg watershed (LWW) are
   presented. The Mann-Kendall trend analysis of observed data over a
   recent time period of 1961 to 2003 shows that, while there has been a
   consistent increasing trend in the mean annual air temperature in the
   region, there is no significant trend in annual precipitation.
   Seasonally, precipitation exhibited a significantly decreasing trend in
   the Saskatchewan and Assiniboine river basins during the winter and an
   increasing trend in part of the Red and Assiniboine river basins during
   summer season. Air temperatures showed significant increases in winter,
   spring and summer throughout the LWW. Future climate projections from
   three RCMs driven by the SRES's A2 emission scenario indicate that by
   the 2050s (2041-2070), total annual precipitation (air temperature)
   increases by 5.5-7.7\% (2.1-2.8 degrees C) compared to the 1980s
   (1971-2000). These observed and projected changes in the climate regimes
   of the LWW will have important implications for the hydrology and
   nutrient transport regimes of this region, which is the subject of
   additional investigation in a companion paper of this special issue

Abstract = {Since climate plays a crucial role on our planet and is an inseparable
   part of all human activities, it is necessary to precisely record all
   parameters in order to estimate current climate conditions, climate
   characteristics of a certain region, as well as to try to predict and
   calculate further trends of climate change. Therefore, for the purpose
   of this paper, air temperature and precipitation of four meteorological
   stations in the Nisava river valley in Southeastern Serbia
   (municipalities of Dimitrovgrad, Pirot, Bela Palanka and Nis) have been
   considered for the period 1960-2015 along with statistical methods for
   analysis of these parameters and prediction of their trends. Results
   have shown that there is a positive trend in mean annual air
   temperatures and average seasonal air temperatures for the whole region
   which can influence natural processes and human activities. For
   precipitation, it can be concluded that no significant change in mean
   annual precipitation for the observed period has occurred. However,
   there is a great difference in the amount of precipitation between
   consecutive years, especially from 2000 onwards which can cause very dry
   years or years with floods.},

Abstract = {This study explores the respective contributions of precipitation and
   temperature variability to the trends of the duration and severity of
   the dryness/wetness, and takes the Pearl River basin (PRB) in the
   southern China as a study example. The Standardized Precipitation
   Evapotranspiration Index (SPED, which uses the monthly precipitation and
   temperature as input variables, was calculated based on the monthly
   precipitation and temperature records of 42 meteorological gauges during
   1960-2015 in the PRB. The run theory was then applied to extract the
   dryness/wetness characteristics including the drought duration and
   severity and the wetting duration and severity. In addition, a simple
   algorithm for quantifying the respective contribution of the
   precipitation and temperature variability to the dryness/wetness trends
   was proposed; the algorithm determines the changes in the slopes
   magnitude (linear regression) for the dryness/wetness characteristics
   that were identified from different SPEI scenarios (i.e. the
   precipitation and temperature groups of observed, one of them detrended,
   and both detrended) using the run theory method. Our results showed that
   the increasing trends of drought duration and severity were more
   apparent in the northwestern areas with high elevation (> 1000 m) than
   the southeastern areas with low elevation (< 500 m), whereas the change
   trends of the wetness duration and severity exhibited opposite results.
   The variability of the precipitation and temperature played different
   roles in the trends of the dryness/wetness characteristics; the effects
   of the temperature changes on these trends were larger than the effects
   of the precipitation changes, i.e., an increase in the temperature
   clearly affected the change trends of duration and severity for the
   dryness/wetness. In the PRB, a slight increase in the average
   precipitation resulted in decreases in the trends of drought duration
   and severity of 9.89\% and 19.63\% respectively and increases in the
   trends of wetting duration and severity of 1.59\% and 11.52\%. However,
   a marked increase in the average temperature resulted in increases in
   the trends of drought duration, drought severity, wetting duration, and
   wetting severity of 48.38\%, 55.16\%, 46.21\%, and 34.40\%,
   respectively. Thus, in light of global warming, the government should
   focus more attention on the evolution of the dryness/wetness
   characteristics because increases in severe drought occurrences and
   flood severities and secondary disasters may result in more severe
   losses.},

Title = {Long-term changes/trends in surface temperature and precipitation during
   the satellite era (1979-2012)},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},

Abstract = {During the post-1979 period in which the satellite-based precipitation
   measurements with global coverage are available, global mean surface
   temperature rapidly increased up to late 1990s, followed by a period of
   temperature hiatus after about 1998/1999. Comparing observed surface
   temperature trends against the simulated ones by the CMIP5 historical
   experiments especially in the zonal mean context suggests that although
   the anthropogenic greenhouse-gases (GHG) forcing has played a major
   role, in addition to the anthropogenic aerosols and various natural
   forcings, the effects from decadal-to-interdecadal-scale internal modes
   specifically the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are also very strong.
   Evident temperature changes associated with the PDO's phase shift are
   seen in the Pacific basin, with decadal-scale cooling in the tropical
   central-eastern Pacific and most of the east basin and concurrent
   warming in the subtropics of both hemispheres, even though the PDO's net
   effect on global mean temperature is relatively weak. The Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) also changed its phase in the mid-1990s,
   and hence its possible impact is estimated and assessed as well.
   However, comparisons with CMIP5 simulations suggest that the AMO may
   have not contributed as significantly as the PDO in terms of the
   changes/trends in global surface temperature, even though the data
   analysis technique used here suggests otherwise. Long-term precipitation
   changes or trends during the post-1979 period are further shown to have
   been modulated by the two major factors: anthropogenic GHG and PDO, in
   addition to the relatively weak effects from aerosols and natural
   forcings. The spatial patterns of observed precipitation trends in the
   Pacific, including reductions in the tropical central-eastern Pacific
   and increases in the tropical western Pacific and along the South
   Pacific Convergence Zone, manifest the PDO's contributions. Removing the
   PDO effect from the total precipitation trends makes the spatial
   structures of precipitation trends more similar to those simulated by
   CMIP5 historical full forcing experiments particularly in the context of
   zonal-mean results. This also confirms that in spite of the PDO effect
   specifically on regional scales, the anthropogenic GHG signals are still
   discernible in observed precipitation during the time period. Following
   the increase of GHG, precipitation tends to increase roughly along the
   climatological ITCZ and decrease south of the equator and in the
   subtropics of both hemispheres.},

Title = {Dependence of Long-Term Temperature Trends on Wind and Precipitation at
   Urban Stations in Japan},

Abstract = {We analyzed long-term trends in temperature for urban areas in Japan,
   after classifying observations according to coincident wind speed and
   precipitation. Trends were defined as departures from regional
   temperatures at nearby rural sites with population density of less than
   100 people per square kilometer, using a 30 year data set from the
   Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) of Japan.
   ``High-wind{''} and ``low-wind{''} cases were defined by the upper and
   lower one-thirds of the geostrophic wind speed (GWS) calculated from
   sea-level pressure gradients at surrounding stations. ``Rain{''} days
   were defined as those having a precipitation rate greater than or equal
   to 1 mm per six hours, while ``no-rain{''} cases had less than this.
   Temperature trends were significantly higher in low-wind conditions than
   in high-wind conditions at stations where the population density was
   more than 3000 km(-2), and trends were higher in no-rain conditions than
   in rain conditions even for slightly urbanized areas with a population
   density from 100 to 300 km(-2). Analysis using surface wind speed
   instead of GWS yielded a result similar to that described above,
   although differences in trends between high- and low-wind conditions
   were smaller than those obtained from an analysis using GWS. At night,
   the differences in temperature trends between high-wind and low-wind
   conditions, and between rain and no-rain conditions, were greater than
   they were when daily mean temperatures were used. These results agree
   with our understanding that the urban heat island effect is more
   pronounced at night under clear skies and low-wind conditions. This
   study provides convincing evidence of urban-induced warming, not only in
   large cities but also at slightly urbanized sites in Japan.},

Abstract = {Agro-climatic classification helps to determine the different features
   of a region. This climatic classification provides a useful insight for
   a farmer to grow their crops according to the conditions of their
   region. This study identifies the shifting of moisture index from
   average values in different agro-climatic zones of Pakistan.
   Unpredictable climate remains dominant over long periods. Observational
   data of precipitation and evapotranspiration were used to determine the
   agro-climatic zone during the period 1951-2010. This study reveals that
   almost 87\% of Pakistan is in extremely arid to semi-arid zones, a 5\%
   decrease in over the last 30 years (1981-2010). The largest decrease of
   8\% and increase of 5\% were observed in the extremely arid and humid
   zones, respectively. The semi-arid zone is more vulnerable to drought,
   while intensity and severity are greater in the extremely arid region.
   An agro-climatic regional analysis identifies 1952, 1969, 2000, 2001 and
   2002 as years when the most severe droughts were observed during the
   study period. The trends of precipitation and temperature were performed
   at 95\% significance level on a monthly, seasonal and annual basis over
   the entire agro-climatic zone of Pakistan during 1951-2014. The annual
   precipitation trends show a significant increase of 0.828 mm year(-1) in
   arid regions, whereas the maximum temperature trends shows a significant
   increase of 0.014 degrees C year(-1) and 0.018 degrees C year(-1) in
   extremely arid and humid regions, respectively. The trend of minimum
   temperature shows an increase over the whole region, which may place
   pressure on the water demands of crops.},

Title = {Attribution and Prediction of Precipitation and Temperature Trends
   within the Sydney Catchment Using Machine Learning},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Droughts in southeastern Australia can profoundly affect the water
   supply to Sydney, Australia's largest city. Increasing population, a
   warming climate, land surface changes and expanded agricultural use
   increase water demand and reduce catchment runoff. Studying Sydney's
   water supply is necessary to manage water resources and lower the risk
   of severe water shortages. This study aims at understanding Sydney's
   water supply by analysing precipitation and temperature trends across
   the catchment. A decreasing trend in annual precipitation was found
   across the Sydney catchment area. Annual precipitation also is
   significantly less variable, due to fewer years above the 80th
   percentile. These trends result from significant reductions in
   precipitation during spring and autumn, especially over the last 20
   years. Wavelet analysis was applied to assess how the influence of
   climate drivers has changed over time. Attribute selection was carried
   out using linear regression and machine learning techniques, including
   random forests and support vector regression. Drivers of annual
   precipitation included Nino3.4, Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and DMI, and
   measures of global warming such as the Tasman Sea sea surface
   temperature anomalies. The support vector regression model with a
   polynomial kernel achieved correlations of 0.921 and a skill score
   compared to climatology of 0.721. The linear regression model also
   performed well with a correlation of 0.815 and skill score of 0.567,
   highlighting the importance of considering both linear and non-linear
   methods when developing statistical models. Models were also developed
   on autumn and winter precipitation but performed worse than annual
   precipitation on prediction. For example, the best performing model on
   autumn precipitation, which accounts for approximately one quarter of
   annual precipitation, achieved an RMSE of 418.036 mm2 on the testing
   data, while annual precipitation achieved an RMSE of 613.704 mm2.
   However, the seasonal models provided valuable insights into whether the
   season would be wet or dry compared to the climatology.},

Abstract = {Air temperature and precipitation variation trends of the upstream of
   Lancang river using the time series from 1957 to 2011 are evaluated. The
   Mann-Kendall method is applied to study the trend and climatic jump of
   the air temperature and precipitation time series. It shows that the
   temperature has an obvious uptrend with an increase of 0.023 degrees C
   per year. The annual precipitation of the upstream of Lancang river is
   954.96 mm without any change, however, the precipitation is gradually
   increased from upstream to downstream. This paper is significant for
   understanding the climate change over the years, and it has practical
   significance for water resources allocation and management in the
   future.},

Abstract = {We present results from a series of ensemble integrations of a global
   coupled atmosphere-ocean model for the period 1865-1997. Each ensemble
   consists of three integrations initialized from different points in a
   long-running GFDLR30 coupled model control simulation. The first
   ensemble includes time-varying forcing from greenhouse gases only. In
   the remaining three ensembles, forcings from anthropogenic sulfate
   aerosols, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere
   are added progressively, such that the fourth ensemble uses all four of
   these forcings. The effects of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols are
   represented by changes in surface albedo, and the effects of volcanic
   aerosols are represented by latitude-dependent perturbations in incident
   solar radiation. Comparisons with observations reveal that the addition
   of the natural forcings ( solar and volcanic) improves the simulation of
   global multidecadal trends in temperature, precipitation, and ocean heat
   content. Solar and volcanic forcings are important contributors to early
   twentieth century warming. Volcanic forcing reduces the warming
   simulated for the late twentieth century. Interdecadal variations in
   global mean surface air temperature from the ensemble of experiments
   with all four forcings are very similar to observed variations during
   most of the twentieth century. The improved agreement of simulated and
   observed temperature trends when natural climate forcings are included
   supports the climatic importance of variations in radiative forcing
   during the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {Incomplete climatic series require gap-filling approaches so they can be
   used in homogeneous long-term spatiotemporal trend analyses. Monthly
   mean Temperature (MT) and Precipitation (PR) databases from the
   meteorological stations of the Iberian Peninsula have a high percentage
   of data gaps: 80.21 \% and 73.25 \% for the period 1950-1979 (P1), and
   61.82 \% and 58.03 \% for the period 1980-2019 (P2). The different
   gap-filling methods of the Emmental software were tested to determine
   their performance and whether the gap-filling method influences these
   trend analyses. The nonparametric Theil-Sen approach and the
   Mann-Kendall test were used to assess the trend magnitude and its
   significance. The results showed (i) similar patterns between the
   evaluated methods, but with (ii) spatial differences, especially during
   P1. (iii) The comparison between standardized gap-filled and unfilled
   series did not show significant differences for MT and PR, although a
   reduction in the trend variability occurred in the first case (filled).
   (iv) Summer mean temperatures showed the largest warming trend (0.27
   degrees C/decade), while autumn showed the smallest (0.21 degrees
   C/decade) (median data for P1 and P2). Overall, an increase of 1.45
   degrees C occurred in the entire period (annual median). (v) PR did not
   show any clear trend in any month in the entire period. This research
   has shown how climate trends can be affected by a reduction in data
   variability due to the application of gap filling methods. Although
   accounting for variability is of crucial importance for climate
   analysis, ignoring discontinuities in derived climatic surfaces causes
   greater spatiotemporal inconsistencies in derived climate products.},

Abstract = {Climate change in the Aral Sea and Pre-Aral region is a complex
   combination of global, regional, and local processes of varying spatial
   and temporal scales. Investigating data on temperature and precipitation
   in the Aral Sea and Pre-Aral region during 1960-2016, we analyzed trends
   using the Mann-Kendall criterion (MK). Our results showed that the
   maximum temperature rises by (P < 0.001) and at a speed of 1.5 degrees
   C/decade, and the minimum temperature also rises with each decade at a
   speed of 6.2 degrees C. The Mann-Kendall static test showed that the
   trend of average temperatures increases by (P < 0.001) and at a speed of
   3.2 degrees C/decade. Annual precipitation showed a significant upward
   trend (P < 0.001) at a rate of 0.8 mm/decade. The correlation between
   air temperature and precipitation was R = 0.265. It is assumed that the
   results of this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of

Abstract = {Based on monthly mean temperature and precipitation data for 53 years,
   from 1957 to 2009, recorded at the Zhangweinan River Basin and five main
   meteorological stations around it, the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend
   test method and cumulative anomaly methods were adopted to analyze the
   long-term trends here of such key meteorological elements as annual mean
   temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation;
   the corresponding Hurst index was calculated; and future change trends
   for various meteorological elements were predicted. The results of the
   analyses indicate that: there is an inconspicuous downward trend in
   annual precipitation for the Zhangweinan River Basin, with large
   decreases appearing in summer, with an M-K slope of -11.82mm/10a; the
   annual mean temperature rises more significantly, and the M-K slope of
   the whole Basin's annual mean temperature reaches 0.17 degrees C/10a,
   the temperature increase being significant in spring and winter.
   According to the Hurst Index calculations, the annual mean temperature
   and precipitation series show strong continuity in the Zhangweinan River
   Basin, which indicates that the future trend will be consistent with
   that of the past. These research results will not only help provide
   evidence for the climate change in the Zhangweinan River Basin but can
   also lay the foundation for further studies on water resources security
   evaluation in conditions of climate change. (C) 2011 Published by

Title = {Deciphering the Trend and Interannual Variability of Temperature and
   Precipitation Extremes over Greenland during 1958-2019},

Abstract = {Greenland experienced multiple extreme weather/climate events in recent
   decades that led to significant melting of the ice sheet. However, how
   the intensity of extreme climate events over Greenland varied under
   recent warm-ing has not been fully examined. Here, we collect 176 in
   situ observations over Greenland and demonstrate that the ob-served
   extreme temperature/precipitation events over Greenland are well
   captured by the RACMO2.3p2 model, in terms of climatological
   distribution, interannual variability, and long-term trend. Thus, we
   then investigate the spatiotemporal features of extreme events over
   Greenland during 1958-2019, using the daily model outputs at 5.5-km
   resolution. The sim-ulated annual maximum temperature exhibits a
   significant increasing trend (-0.13 \& DEG;C decade -1) during
   1958-2019, whereas there is a weakening trend (-0.24 \& DEG;C decade -1)
   in annual minimum temperature over Greenland, especially after the 1990s
   (-1.24 \& DEG;C decade -1). For the interannual variability, changes in
   temperature extremes between warm and cold temperature years share large
   similarities with the distributions of long-term trends. The extreme
   precipitation events measured by an-nual maximum daily precipitation
   amount show a profound increasing trend (0.52 mm day -1 decade -1) over
   northeastern Greenland during 1958-2019, with large interannual
   variability in the ice-free coastal region and southern Greenland.
   Ad-ditionally, the changes in extreme warm and cold events are generally
   linked with the variation of Greenland blocking in summer and Arctic
   polar vortex in winter, respectively, in terms of favorable circulation
   background, and the extreme pre-cipitation events are often associated
   with the position of the polar jet stream.},

Abstract = {Long-term trend analysis of meteorological variables is required for
   implementing any hydrological model or water resources management model
   to a basin. Spatio-temporal variations in precipitation and temperature
   of a basin are helpful for meteorologists, agriculturists and
   policymakers to take appropriate decisions. This study performs
   long-term trend analysis for gridded precipitation (1901-2019) and
   temperature (1951-2019) datasets of 0.25o x 0.25o resolution in the
   Munneru river basin, India using five different trend tests for annual,
   seasonal and monthly time steps in sub-basin wise. An increasing trend
   is observed in annual precipitation in the first sub-basin (S1) at 8.6
   mm/decade and in the third sub-basin (S3) at 11.6 mm/decade. An
   increasing trend is observed for both annual average maximum and minimum
   temperature at a rate of 1.5oC and 0.06oC per decade for the basin,
   respectively. Twenty different climate extreme indices are calculated
   using daily data of precipitation and temperature. Increasing trend is
   observed for PCPTOT, R20mm, RX5DAY, R95PTOT, SDII, TX90P, TXX and WSDI
   indices. Decreasing trend is observed for CWD, CSDI, TN10P and TX10P at
   particular grid points. Results from this study are useful to understand
   the climate variability and its impact on water resources in the future
   periods and hydrological assessment in the basin.},

Abstract = {The selection of statistical methods to evaluate data depends on study
   questions and characteristics of available data. In climate science,
   some methods are more popularly used than others; however, the use of
   applicable alternative methods does not invalidate study findings.
   Regardless of limitations, some methods like Pearson ordinary
   correlation are widely used in all sciences including climate and by
   scientists at government agencies like NOAA and the USGS. In addition,
   the use of the robust Student's t test is valid for near-Gaussian
   distributions with high sample numbers, since it is resistant to data
   distribution inconsistencies. We wish to put in context the citation
   about our article and clarify the methods and justification for using
   them and to educate readers about the use of some conventional

Abstract = {As a geographically diverse region, Texas has a wide variety of local

   identify trends for the periods of 1895-2019 and 1990-2019. Results show
   no significant trends in the past century but significant cooling and
   wetting in the recent decades. Gridded trend maps revealed the spatial
   and seasonal heterogeneity, which exhibits cooling in summer and winter
   for most areas and increasing precipitation in western, south central
   and southern areas. The northern area has become hotter and drier. The
   high spatial resolution and long-term coverage captured features not
   discovered before, providing a fundamental step toward understanding

Journal = {ALL EARTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the historical and projected climate
   trend analysis in the Upper East Region, Ghana, using time series and
   modelled climate data under shared socio-economic pathways scenarios.
   Due to the climate data scarcity challenge in Ghana, there is a need to
   rely on high-resolution satellite-based climate products for climate
   change studies. Accordingly, temperature and precipitation data of six
   stations were obtained from Ghana meteorological stations; in addition,
   precipitation data of five satellite stations were obtained from CHIRPS
   data with 0.05' (5 km) resolution to complement the in-situ datasets;
   and the temperature data for the satellite station obtained from the
   NASA power project were extracted. Modelled climate data were obtained
   from five GCMs in the CMIP data portal on the WCRP website. R software
   was used to extract NetCDF-format GCM data to Excel format and CMhyd was
   used for downscaling GCM data. The variance scaling method and local
   intensity scaling methods were used for temperature and precipitation
   bias correction, respectively. The Mann-Kendall (MK) method was used to
   determine the statistical significance of a change and identify trends
   in temperature and precipitation. The results of historical temperatures
   were significantly increased, while historical precipitation was
   significantly decreased. The projected mean annual temperature will
   increase significantly, peaking at 1.80 degrees C by 2065, precipitation
   will, conversely, show significant spatial variability and seasonal
   dependency. For instance, by 2065, precipitation is projected to
   decrease between 10.05\% and 12.66\%. The results concluded by
   recommending policymakers develop climate change adaptation strategies
   guided by future climate scenarios.},

   HUIXTLA RIVER BASIN IN CHIAPAS, MEXICO},
Journal = {AGROCIENCIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {58},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {The objective of this work was to analyze whether there is a trend in
   climate change in the Huixtla River basin on the Mexican Pacific coast
   in the State of Chiapas. To detect this, temperature and precipitation
   trends were analyzed using data for the 1960-2014 period and the 27
   indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and
   Indices (ETCCDI) at Despoblado, Escuintla, Finca Chicharras, Huehuet \&
   aacute;n, Huixtla, and Motozintla weather stations of the National
   Meteorological Service (SMN). Missing data were collected where
   necessary for precipitation using the U.S. National Wheater Service
   method and for temperatures using the Climate Engine platform. The
   indices were obtained with RClimDex by conducting the proposed data
   quality controls and classified on the basis of their statistical
   significance (0.05) and their increasing or decreasing trend. Among the
   changes found, higher temperatures were detected in the middle and lower
   western parts of the basin (TX90p), as well as a longer period of hot
   days (WSDI). The upper and lower eastern parts of the basin presented a
   shorter period of hot days. The upper and lower parts of the basin
   showed a cooling trend, with colder days (TX10p) over longer periods
   (CSDI). Across the basin, precipitation has increased by one and five
   days (RX1day and RX5day) as well as in total amount (PRCPTOT). In
   general, there were shorter dry periods (CDD) and longer wet periods
   (CWD). Rainfall above the R5mm, R10mm, R20mm, R70mm, and R150mm
   thresholds across the basin showed an increasing trend.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Usnic acid contents in acetone extracts of 31 samples of lichen Parmelia
   flexilis collected from different altitudes were identified using thin
   layer chromatography (TLC) and determined by high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC). The usnic acid content varied in between highest
   5.13\% to lowest 1.66\% in oven dried (80 degrees C) lichen samples. The
   species collected from lower altitudes all show high levels of usnic
   acid. The negative relationship between usnic acid and altitude was
   obtained. Statistically, it is revealed that there is a significant
   difference between average percentages of usnic acid in lichen samples
   with varying altitudes (p < 0.05). Beside these, the precipitation
   averages of the regions where the species have been collected were
   linked with the content of usnic acid. It is clear that lichens from the
   regions receiving the highest precipitation produced lower amounts of
   usnic acid. The results suggest that the production of secondary
   metabolite in lichens is altered due to the climatic variables like
   temperature and precipitation at different altitude gradients.},

   1975-1994, which we find as very important period when atmospheric
   circulation was altered. Mean annual temperature and precipitation were
   greater in the second half-period, while the discharge was smaller, even
   all the signals had growth trend. Mean seasonal temperature increased
   for all seasons, as well as precipitation, except for summer (JJA). The
   discharge is lower in the second half-period for almost all seasons,

   (CMIP5). This study is focused on continental areas (60 degrees S-60
   degrees N) during 1930-2004 to ensure higher reliability in the
   observations. A nonparametric trend detection method is employed, and
   long-term persistence is quantified using the Hurst coefficient, taken
   from the hydrology literature. The authors found that the multimodel
   ensemble-mean global land-average temperature trend (0.07 degrees C
   decade(-1)) captures the corresponding observed trend well (0.08 degrees
   C decade(-1)). Globally, precipitation trends are distributed
   (spatially) at about zero in both the models and in the observations.
   There are large uncertainties in the simulation of regional-/local-scale
   temperature and precipitation trends. The models' relative performances
   are different for temperature and precipitation trends. The models
   capture the long-term persistence in temperature reasonably well. The
   areal coverage of observed long-term persistence in precipitation is
   60\% less (32\% of land area) than that of temperature (78\%). The
   models have limited capability to capture the long-term persistence in
   precipitation. Most climate models underestimate the spatial variability
   in temperature trends. The multimodel ensemble-average trend generally
   provides a conservative estimate of local/regional trends. The results
   of this study are generally not biased by the choice of observation
   datasets used, including Climatic Research Unit Time Series 3.1;
   temperature data from Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit, version 4;
   and precipitation data from Global Historical Climatology Network,
   version 2.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the changes in the exceedances of joint extremes of
   temperature and precipitation quantiles for a number of sites in Europe.
   The combination of cool/dry, cool/wet, warm/dry and warm/wet modes
   reveals a systematic change at all locations investigated in the course
   of the 20th century, with significant declines in the frequency of
   occurrence of the ``cold'' modes and a sharp rise in that of the
   ``warm'' modes. The changing behavior of these four modes is also
   accompanied by changes in the particular conditions of temperature and
   precipitation associated with each mode; for example, the average amount
   of precipitation during cool/wet events decreases while that during
   warm/wet events increases, even though mean precipitation at most
   locations shows no significant trend. In a ``greenhouse climate'', the
   ``cool'' modes are almost totally absent by 2100 whereas the warm/dry
   and warm/wet modes pursue the progression already observed in the 20th
   century. Citation: Beniston, M. (2009), Trends in joint quantiles of

Abstract = {In the southern Peruvian Andes, communities are highly dependent on
   climatic conditions due to the mainly rain-fed agriculture and the
   importance of glaciers and snow melt as a freshwater resource.
   Longer-term trends and year-to-year variability of precipitation or
   temperature severely affect living conditions. This study evaluates
   seasonal precipitation and temperature climatologies and trends in the
   period 1965/66-2017/18 for the southern Peruvian Andes using
   quality-controlled and homogenized station data and new observational
   gridded data. In this region, precipitation exhibits a strong annual
   cycle with very dry winter months and most of the precipitation falling
   from spring to autumn. Spatially, a northeast-southwest gradient in
   austral spring is observed, related to an earlier start of the rainy
   season in the northeastern part of the study area. Seasonal variations
   of maximum temperature are weak with an annual maximum in austral
   spring, which is related to reduced cloud cover in austral spring
   compared to summer. On the contrary, minimum temperatures show larger
   seasonal variations, possibly enhanced through changes in longwave
   incoming radiation following the precipitation cycle. Precipitation
   trends since 1965 exhibit low spatial consistency except for austral
   summer, when in most of the study area increasing precipitation is
   observed, and in austral spring, when stations in the central-western
   region of the study area register decreasing precipitation. All seasonal
   and annual trends in maximum temperature are larger than trends in
   minimum temperature. Maximum temperature exhibits strong trends in
   austral winter and spring, whereas minimum temperature trends are
   strongest in austral winter. We hypothesize, that these trends are
   related to precipitation changes, as decreasing (increasing)
   precipitation in spring (summer) may enhance maximum (minimum)
   temperature trends through changes in cloud cover. El Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO), however, has modifying effects onto precipitation
   and temperature, and thereby leads to larger trends in maximum
   temperatures.},

Abstract = {The Upper Indus Basin (UIB) is a major water resource for Pakistan, and
   recent years have seen it profoundly affected by climate change,
   resulting in catastrophic events. Analyzing climatic patterns in UIB and
   its sub-basins is vital for sustainable water resource management. This
   research delves into the precipitation and temperature trends within the
   Gilgit and Hunza River basins (sub-basins of UIB) from 1980 to 2019,
   utilizing an extensive dataset comprising ground station records and
   global climate datasets such as CRU and ERA 5. Our findings indicate a
   notable increase in temperatures, particularly pronounced in the Hunza
   basin compared to Gilgit. Conversely, precipitation trends reveal a
   predominant decrease. Employing validation techniques, we confirmed that
   ERA 5 surpassed CRU in providing accurate temperature and precipitation
   data. Employing methods including the Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope, and
   Abrupt Change Point Tests, we identified temperature increases of 0.21
   degrees C and 0.25 degrees C per decade. Additionally, CRU assessments
   unveiled a decline in diurnal temperature. Seasonal analysis showcased
   significant temperature rises during summer, autumn, and spring, while
   winter conditions remained consistently stable. Our analysis also
   pointed to slight increases in summer precipitation, with winters
   exhibiting heightened wetness according to the CRU datasets. Continual
   monitoring of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) is imperative for enhancing
   precision and reliability. This proactive approach, complemented by
   meticulous spatiotemporal analysis, will establish a robust foundation
   for comprehending and addressing climate changes in the region.},

Abstract = {Monthly temperature and precipitation time-series for the Zhujiang River
   Basin are analyzed in order to identify changes in climate extremes.
   Daily temperature and precipitation data from 1961 to 2007 of 192
   meteorological stations are used. Two temperature indicators (monthly
   mean and monthly maximum mean) and three precipitation indicators
   (monthly total, monthly maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation, and
   monthly dry days) are analyzed. Tendencies in all five indicators can be
   observed. Many stations show significant positive trends (above the 90\%
   confidence level) for monthly mean temperatures and monthly maximum mean
   temperatures. For all months, a significant increase in temperature from
   1961 to 2007 can be observed in the entire basin with the coastal area
   in particular. Positive trends of precipitation extremes can be observed
   from January to March. Negative trends are detected from September to
   November. The number of dry days in October increased significantly at
   40\% of all meteorological stations. Stations with changes of monthly
   precipitation extremes are scattered over the Zhujiang River Basin. An
   aggregation of heat waves and droughts can be detected which is
   accompanied by significant increases of temperature extremes and the
   negative tendencies in precipitation extremes. The detection of
   tendencies in climate extremes essentially relies on a good data quality
   and high station density.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal changes of temperature and precipitation extremes from
   1956 to 2015 were analyzed at 200 representative weather stations evenly
   distributed in the temperate continental zone (TCZ), temperate monsoon
   zone (TMZ), mountain plateau zone (MPZ), and (sub) tropical monsoon zone
   (SMZ) of China, using 16 extreme temperature and 11 extreme
   precipitation indexes. The results showed that warm days (TX90p) and
   warm nights (TN90p) increased significantly, while cool days (TX10p) and
   cool nights (TN10p) decreased significantly in the whole China. Overall
   increasing trends were found for maximum and minimum daily maximum
   temperature (TXx and TXn) and maximum and minimum daily minimum
   temperature (TNx and TNn). Warm indexes, including summer days (SU25),
   tropical nights (TR20), warm spell duration indicator (WSDI), and
   growing season length (GSL), showed increasing trends, whereas cold
   indexes such as frost days (FD0), ice days (ID0), cold spell duration
   indicator (CSDI), and diurnal temperature range (DTR) showed decreasing
   trends. These extreme temperature indexes exhibited high correlations
   with mean air temperature. MPZ exhibited the most remarkable change
   magnitudes among the four zones, while the smallest changes occurred in
   SMZ. An accelerating warming trend was particularly observed since 1986.
   Nationally, only daily rainfall intensity (SDII) showed significantly
   increasing trends, while the increasing trends of other precipitation
   indexes were not significant. Apart from consecutive wet days (CWD),
   changes of precipitation extremes presented increasing trends. PRCPTOT
   and R10mm exhibited the highest correlation coefficient across
   contrasting climatic zones. Regionally averaged precipitation totals
   were decreasing in TMZ during 1956-1985, but increasing trends were
   identified after 1985. The upward tendency of precipitation totals in
   MPZ and the west part of TCZ may alleviate the pressure of water
   shortage in arid and semi-arid regions of China, but the upward trend in
   SMZ, especially in the coastal areas of southeastern China, may
   aggravate the risk of flood-induced disasters in these regions.},

Title = {Farmer perceptions of climate change: Associations with observed
   temperature and precipitation trends, irrigation, and climate beliefs},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {133-142},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {How individuals perceive climate change is linked to whether individuals
   support climate policies and whether they alter their own
   climate-related behaviors, yet climate perceptions may be influenced by
   many factors beyond local shifts in weather. Infrastructure designed to
   control or regulate natural resources may serve as an important lens
   through which people experience climate, and thus may influence
   perceptions. Likewise, perceptions may be influenced by personal beliefs
   about climate change and whether it is human-induced. Here we examine
   farmer perceptions of historical climate change, how perceptions are
   related to observed trends in regional climate, how perceptions are
   related to the presence of irrigation infrastructure, and how
   perceptions are related to beliefs and concerns about climate change. We
   focus on the regions of Marlborough and Hawke's Bay in New Zealand,
   where irrigation is utilized on the majority of cropland. Data are
   obtained through analysis of historical climate records from local
   weather stations, interviews (n = 20), and a farmer survey (n = 490).
   Across both regions, no significant historical trends in annual
   precipitation and summer temperatures since 1980 are observed, but
   winter warming trends are significant at around 0.2-0.3 degrees C per
   decade. A large fraction of farmers perceived increases in annual
   rainfall despite instrumental records indicating no significant trends,
   a finding that may be related to greater perceived water availability
   associated with irrigation growth. A greater fraction of farmers
   perceived rainfall increases in Marlborough, where irrigation growth has
   been most substantial. We find those classes of farmers more likely to
   have irrigation were also significantly more likely to perceive an
   increase in annual rainfall. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
   perceptions of changing climate - regardless of their accuracy - are
   correlated with increased belief in climate change and an increased
   concern for future climate impacts. Those farmers that believe climate
   change is occurring and is human induced are more likely to perceive
   temperature increases than farmers who believe climate change is not
   occurring and is not human induced. These results suggest that
   perceptions are influenced by a variety of personal and environmental
   factors, including infrastructure, which may in turn alter decisions
   about climate adaptation. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Volume = {98},

Abstract = {For the analysis of trends in weather extremes, we introduce a
   diagnostic index variable, the exceedance product, which combines
   intensity and frequency of extremes. We separate trends in higher
   moments from trends in mean or standard deviation and use bootstrap
   resampling to evaluate statistical significances. The application of the
   concept of the exceedance product to daily meteorological time series
   from Potsdam (1893 to 2005) and Prague-Klementinum (1775 to 2004)
   reveals that extremely cold winters occurred only until the mid-20th
   century, whereas warm winters show upward trends. These changes were
   significant in higher moments of the temperature distribution. In
   contrast, trends in summer temperature extremes (e. g., the 2003
   European heatwave) can be explained by linear changes in mean or
   standard deviation. While precipitation at Potsdam does not show
   pronounced trends, dew point does exhibit a change from maximum extremes
   during the 1960s to minimum extremes during the 1970s.},

Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Analyzing long-term climate changes is a prerequisite for identifying
   hotspot areas and developing site-specific adaptation measures. The
   current study focuses on assessing changes in precipitation, maximum and
   minimum temperatures, and potential evapotranspiration in Zambia and
   Malawi from 1981 to 2021. High-resolution precipitation and temperature
   datasets are used, namely, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
   with Station data (0.05 degrees) and Multi-Source Weather (0.1 degrees).
   The Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's Slope methods are employed to
   assess the changes. The trend analysis shows a non-significant increase
   in annual precipitation in many parts of Zambia and Central Malawi. In
   Zambia and Malawi, the average annual and seasonal maximum and minimum
   temperatures show a statistically significant increasing trend (up to
   0.6 degrees C/decade). The change in precipitation during the major
   rainy seasons (December-April) shows a non-significant increasing trend
   (up to 3 mm/year) in a large part of Zambia and Central Malawi. However,
   Malawi and Northern Zambia show a non-significant decreasing trend (up
   to -5 mm/year). The change in December-April precipitation significantly
   correlates with El Ni \& ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (Indian Ocean
   Dipole) in Southern (Northern) Zambia and Malawi. To minimize the impact
   of the observed changes, it is imperative to develop adaptation measures
   to foster sustainability in the region.},

Abstract = {Annual and seasonal changes of temperature and precipitation were
   analyzed based on climate data at 27 meteorological stations in the
   Hengduan Mountains region during 1960-2008. The average annual, spring,
   summer, autumn, and winter temperatures exhibited significantly
   increasing trends of 0.15, 0.589, 0.153, 0.167 and 0.347 degrees
   C/decade over the studied period, respectively. Temperature increases
   showed a relationship with increasing elevation. In contrast to the
   temperature, the significance of changes in precipitation during
   1960-2008 was low. Regional precipitation for annual, spring, autumn,
   and winter showed nonsignificant increasing trends of 9.09, 8.62, 1.53,
   and 1.47 mm/decade. Summer precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend at
   a rate of -1.5 mm/decade. Under the influence of the longitudinal
   range-gorge, the regional trend in precipitation was on the decrease
   from the southwest to the northeast in Hengduan Mountains. During the
   summer monsoon period, the increase in temperature was 0.117 degrees
   C/decade, significant at the level of 0.001. Precipitation increased at
   6.01 min/decade, but also started to decrease and fluctuate after 2000.
   There was also a 0.25 degrees C/decade and 7.47 mm/decade increase of
   temperature and precipitation, significant at the 0.001 level, in the
   winter monsoon period. The climatic complexity in a mountainous region
   is reflected by the temporal and spatial differences of climate in the
   Hengduan Mountains. Compared with other regions in China, the climatic
   warming magnitude is relatively lower in the Hengduan Mountains. (C)

   in the second (1993-2018) compared with the first half (1967-1992) of
   our study (165 vs. 94 kg dry matter . ha(-1); P < 0.01). Precipitation
   was lower and more erratic in the second half of the time series,
   decreasing by 18.6\% (265.2 +/- 15.0 vs. 215.8 +/- 15.8 mm; P = 0.01).
   Conversely, mean maximum and mean ambient temperatures were higher
   during the 1993-2018 period (max T: 24.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 25.3 +/- 0.1
   degrees C; P < 0.01; mean T:14.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 15.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C; P <
   0.01). MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
   analysis showed that growing seasons began and ended later and became
   shorter (P < 0.05) over the 14 yr analyzed. During this period,
   increasing maximum spring and summer (May-September) ambient
   temperatures were associated with decreasing growing season NDVI values
   (P < 0.01). Over the 52-yr study period, Chihuahuan Desert rangelands at
   our research site lost 43\% of grazing capacity based on PGP. Nine
   drought yr occurred in the second half of our study compared with 2 yr
   in the first half. Our research supports predictions by climate
   scientists that higher temperatures, more frequent droughts, and lower,
   as well as more erratic, precipitation will adversely impact grazing
   capacity of rangelands in the southwestern United States. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {According to the daily maximum and minimum temperature and the
   precipitation at 40 meteorological stations in the Daqing River Basin of
   China during 1980-2015, the spatial and temporal trends of extreme
   temperature and precipitation are analyzed. The trend strengths,
   stability, and magnitude are calculated for ten indices of temperature
   and eight indices of precipitation. The results show that trends of
   extreme temperature indices are significant, but extreme precipitation
   indices are insignificant. Through the extreme temperature indices, the
   cold indices of extreme temperature decrease steadily and the warm
   indices of extreme temperature rise steadily, indicating that the trends
   of temperature rising in the basin are obvious and stable. In addition,
   indices of the extreme precipitation indicate that the consecutive dry
   days (CDD) decrease, the heavy precipitation days (R20) and the
   consecutive wet days (CWD) increase, and the annual total precipitation
   (PRCPTOT) increases steadily. The results have certain scientific value
   for climate change and a series of impacts brought by climate change in

Title = {Characterization of variability and trends in daily precipitation and
   temperature extremes in the Horn of Africa},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Abstract = {Modeling of extreme weather conditions is an important issue in
   environmental risk assessment, management and protection. In this paper,
   Annual and monthly maxima of daily temperature and rainfall data dating
   from 1901-2016 and 1950-2018 are characterized for nine countries within
   the greater horn of Africa. The generalized extreme value (GEV)
   distribution is fitted to the data sets from each of the nine countries
   using the method of maximum likelihood. Both the location and scale
   parameters of the GEV is formulated as a function of time to account for
   variability and trends in the extremes of temperature and rainfall so
   that their future behavior can be predicted. Based on our results, We
   provide return levels for the years 2, 10, 50 100, and 200 which could
   be used as measures of flood protection. To understand the spatial
   cross-correlation patterns on different time scales in each country and
   how rainfall and temperature are related to agricultural variables, we
   utilize the detrended cross-correlation coefficient (rho(DCCA)) and its
   generalization, (DMCx2) to account for that, respectively. Given the
   results of the (DMCx2) and the fact that climate extremes pose a huge
   threat to agriculture and food security, we employed copula based models
   to describe the structure of dependence between climatic variables and
   the crop related variables such as yield and production quantity. The
   results from the copula analysis show that irrespective of the country,
   climatic factors and the agricultural products(production/yield) the
   strongest dependence is demonstrated by the pairs involving cereal
   crops, while the weakest dependence is characterized by the pairs
   involving regular potato.},

Abstract = {The relationships between precipitation and temperature in the central
   Sudano-Sahelian belt are investigated by analyzing 50 years (1959-2008)
   of observed temperature (Tx and Tn) and rainfall variations. At daily
   time-scale, both Tx and Tn show a marked decrease as a response to
   rainfall occurrence, with a strongest departure from normal 1 day after
   the rainfall event (-0.5 to -2.5 A degrees C depending on the month).
   The cooling is slightly larger when heavy rainfall events (> 5 mm) are
   considered. The temperature anomalies weaken after the rainfall event,
   but are still significant several days later. The physical mechanisms
   accounting for the temperature response to precipitation are analysed.
   The Tx drop is accounted for by reduced incoming solar radiation
   associated with increased cloud cover and increased surface evaporation
   following surface moistening. The effect of evaporation becomes dominant
   a few days after the rainfall event. The reduced daytime heat storage
   and the subsequent sensible heat flux result in a later negative Tn
   anomaly. The effect of rainfall variations on temperature is significant
   for long-term warming trends. The rainfall decrease experienced between
   1959 and 2008 accounts for a rainy season Tx increase of 0.15 to 0.3 A
   degrees C, out of a total Tx increase of 1.3 to 1.5 A degrees C. These
   results have strong implications on the assessment of future temperature
   changes. The dampening or amplifying effects of precipitation are
   determined by the sign of future precipitation trends. Confidence on
   temperature changes under global warming partly depend on the robustness
   of precipitation projections.},

Abstract = {Regional Climate Models (RCMs) provide climate information required for
   evaluating vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation at finer scales than
   their global driving models. As they explicitly resolve the basic
   conservation and state equations, they solve physics with more detail,
   conserving teleconnection of larger scales provided by Global Climate
   Models (GCMs). In South America (SA), the regional simulations have been
   historically evaluated principally on climatological aspects, but the
   representativeness of extremes still needs a more profound assessment.
   This study aims to analyze three RCMs (RegCM4-7, REMO2015, and Eta)
   driven by different GCMs in SA, focusing on their capacity to reproduce
   extreme historical indices of daily precipitation and temperature. The
   indices of maximum consecutive 5 days precipitation (Rx5day),
   Consecutive Dry Days (CDD), daily maximum and minimum annual temperature
   (TXx and TNn, respectively) were evaluated regarding the historical
   spatio-temporal variability and trends. Furthermore, their projections
   for the 2071-2099 period, under the Representative Concentration Pathway
   8.5 scenario, were analyzed. The historical behavior of RCMs (1981-2005)
   was compared with two gridded products: Climate Prediction Center (CPC)
   and agrometeorological indicators derived from the fifth generation of
   global reanalysis produced by the ECMWF (AgERA5), previously compared
   with records from meteorological stations to evaluate them. The results
   show that the highest differences within the gridded products and
   stations were observed in the regions with more scarce surface stations
   (North and West of SA) and with complex topography (The Andes
   Cordillera), being more pronounced in the precipitation-based indices.
   We found that RCMs generally show more agreement in the spatial
   variability than in the inter-annual variability for all the indices and
   SA regions. When analyzing the observed trends, all models better
   reproduced the long-term variability of extreme temperature indices than
   those of rainfall. More disagreement was observed for Rx5day and CDD
   indices trends, including substantial spatial heterogeneities in both
   magnitude and sign of tendency. Climate change projections exhibited
   significant agreement to warmer conditions in TXx and TNn, but
   precipitation signals differed between RCMs and the driving GCM within
   each regional model. Maximum dry spells are expected to increase in
   almost all SA regions, whereas the climate change signals in extreme
   precipitation events are more consistent over southeastern SA (northern
   and southwestern SA), with positive (negative) changes by the end of the
   century.},

Abstract = {Among the projected effects of climate change, water resources are at
   the center of the matrix. Certainly, the southern African climate is
   changing, consequently, localized studies are needed to determine the
   magnitude of anticipated changes for effective adaptation. Utilizing
   historical observation data over the Olifants River Catchment, we
   examined trends in temperature and rainfall for the period 1976-2019. In
   addition, future climate change projections under the RCP 4.5 and RCP
   8.5 scenarios for two time periods of 2036-2065 (near future) and
   2066-2095 (far future) were analysed using an ensemble of eight regional
   climate model (RCA4) simulations of the CORDEX Africa initiative. A
   modified Mann-Kendall test was used to determine trends and the
   statistical significance of annual and seasonal rainfall and
   temperature. The characteristics of extreme dry conditions were assessed
   by computing the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The results
   suggest that the catchment has witnessed an increase in temperatures and
   an overall decline in rainfall, although no significant changes have
   been detected in the distribution of rainfall over time. Furthermore,
   the surface temperature is expected to rise significantly, continuing a
   trend already evident in historical developments. The results further
   indicate that the minimum temperatures over the Catchment are getting
   warmer than the maximum temperatures. Seasonally, the minimum
   temperature warms more frequently in the summer season from December to
   February (DJF) and the spring season from September to November (SON)
   than in the winter season from June to August (JJA) and in the autumn
   season from March to May (MAM). The results of the SPI affirm the
   persistent drought conditions over the Catchment. In the context of the
   current global warming, this study provides an insight into the changing
   characteristics of temperatures and rainfall in a local context. The
   information in this study can provide policymakers with useful
   information to help them make informed decisions regarding the Olifants
   River Catchment and its resources.},

Abstract = {Based on the monthly meteorological data collected from Kunming weather
   stations in recent 26 years, the change characteristics of annual and
   inter-annual precipitation and temperature are analysized by linearity
   trend estimation: the change characteristics of precipitation and
   temperature are given a phased analysis by analyzing annual temperature
   anomaly.Mann-Kendall technique is applied to detect the change trend of
   precipitation and temperature. The result demonstrates that: the
   precipitation shows an increasing but not obvious trend; the mean
   temperature shows a clear increase trend. The inter-annual precipitation
   and mean temperature is high in the middle and low at the two ends,
   which shows an obvious seasonal distribution. The result of Mann-Kendall
   trend test shows: the change trends of precipitation of different
   seasons are not in accordance with the trend of the whole year, and
   there is a obvious increase in spring winter and the whole year and
   obvious decrease in fall; the change trends of mean temperature in
   different season are in accordance with that of the whole year, and all
   these periods have obvious increase trends.},

Abstract = {Freshwater lakes are an important natural and cultural resource in
   national parks across the USA. At Cape Cod National Seashore, in
   southeastern Massachusetts, the water quality of these water bodies
   (known as kettle ponds), along with local precipitation chemistry, has
   been measured since the 1980s. These datasets, along with air
   temperature obtained from a local weather station, were analyzed to
   assess temporal trends in the air temperature, precipitation acidity,
   pond temperature, and pond pH, and are interpreted within the context of
   regional air quality improvements and increasing temperatures from
   regional climate warming. The results suggest that all parameters have
   increased significantly during the last several decades. As temperature
   and pH regulate a wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological
   processes, these changes may be influencing the overall ecology of the
   kettle ponds. This analysis provides an opportunity to gauge the future
   trajectory of this important resource and may ultimately guide
   management strategies for their continued protection against a backdrop
   of climate change and atmospheric emission controls.},

Abstract = {The longest precipitation and temperature series of the peninsular Spain
   and Balearic Islands are analysed covering the periods 1880-1995 and
   1900-1997 respectively. To identify coherent behaviour in these series,
   the PCA method has been used, resulting in several major noise-filtered
   time series. For temperature data, although two statistically
   significant EOFs have been obtained for the western and eastern parts of
   Spain, the entire region can be described by one EOF and its time
   evolution by the first PC series. These time series show a general
   upward trend and some abrupt changes. On the other hand, for
   precipitation, we have obtained three significant EOFs, except for
   winter, when we find four EOFs. The first EOF can be associated with
   Andalusia and Spanish Interior, the second and third EOFs with
   Mediterranean and Cantabric coasts, alternatively, depending on the
   season. The analysis of the principal components series using moving
   average and the Mann-Kendall test, show significant long term decreases
   in precipitation for Mediterranean region and Interior (at least in some
   seasons) and an increase of the precipitation for the Northern coastal
   region. The changes found have been related to changes in the
   circulation patterns and discussed from the perspective of climatic
   change.},

Abstract = {Kansas extends 660 km from the moderate elevations and semi-humid
   conditions of the Lower Missouri Basin to the High Plains lying above
   the Ogallala Aquifer and along the Rockies' eastern slope. Such
   characteristics result in significant climate variability across the
   state, making timely and accurate climate trend and change information
   valuable for water resources management and crop production. Here we
   used high-quality daily and monthly climate observations spanning a
   long-term period of 121 years (1895-2015) to assess trends and changes
   in air temperature, precipitation, drought, and frost-free days across
   Kansas. We show that a statewide average warming rate of 0.06 degrees C
   (0.11 degrees F) per decade was mainly driven by trends in daily minimum
   temperatures. However, there were no statistically significant trends in
   precipitation in either western, central, or eastern Kansas. Western
   Kansas tended toward increasing dryness, but central and eastern Kansas
   trended wetter as indicated by changes in the Palmer Drought Severity
   Index (PDSI), a trend that was consistent with a weak wetting signal in
   eastern Kansas. The length of frost-free season increased by 5.2 days in
   western, 7.2 days in central, and 12.6 days in eastern Kansas, which
   reflected more warming in the east and less in the west, especially for
   changing magnitudes of nighttime temperatures. Such increases of
   frost-free days, especially in moisture-limited areas (e.g., western
   Kansas), might increase seasonal evapotranspiration loss, thus
   exacerbating soil moisture stress and associated management challenges.},

Abstract = {The study of the statistical trends on rainfall and temperature is much
   more efficient for hydrological design and planning for scarce water
   availability zones. In the present study, the sequential Mann-Kendall
   test (SqMKT) on the Mat-Lab platform is used to study the pattern of
   rainfall series and temperature series data of the Tikamgarh area of
   India, surrounded by five stations (nearby) from 2000 to 2020. The SqMKT
   is mainly used to perform non-linear trends on the rainfall and
   temperature series. In the SqMKT analysis on rainfall series projects,
   there was no significant trend in all months, except in the month of
   June. These months have intersecting points, and each point has Z values
   in the range of -0.5 < Z < 1.5. The SqMKT analysis on the temperature
   series shows a significant trend in the months of April, June, July and
   December, respectively, whereas the remaining months do not have any
   pattern or trend, similar to the rainfall series and temperature series
   have u values in the range of -0.5 < u < 1.5. The global climatic
   pattern is somewhat directly or indirectly connected to the Indian
   climate pattern, which results in variations in rainfall and temperature
   patterns from year to year. The indefinite variation in rainfall and
   temperature results in a direct impact on crop yield and crop water
   demand or total water availability.},

Title = {Application of Machine Learning to Attribution and Prediction of
   Seasonal Precipitation and Temperature Trends in Canberra, Australia},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Southeast Australia is frequently impacted by drought, requiring
   monitoring of how the various factors influencing drought change over
   time. Precipitation and temperature trends were analysed for Canberra,
   Australia, revealing decreasing autumn precipitation. However, annual
   precipitation remains stable as summer precipitation increased and the
   other seasons show no trend. Further, mean temperature increases in all
   seasons. These results suggest that Canberra is increasingly vulnerable
   to drought. Wavelet analysis suggests that the El-Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) influences precipitation and temperature in Canberra,
   although its impact on precipitation has decreased since the 2000s.
   Linear regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR) were applied
   to attribute climate drivers of annual precipitation and mean maximum
   temperature (TMax). Important attributes of precipitation include ENSO,
   the southern annular mode (SAM), Indian Ocean Dipole (DMI) and Tasman
   Sea SST anomalies. Drivers of TMax included DMI and global warming
   attributes. The SVR models achieved high correlations of 0.737 and 0.531
   on prediction of precipitation and TMax, respectively, outperforming the
   LR models which obtained correlations of 0.516 and 0.415 for prediction
   of precipitation and TMax on the testing data. This highlights the
   importance of continued research utilising machine learning methods for
   prediction of atmospheric variables and weather pattens on multiple time
   scales.},

Abstract = {Reconciling observations and simulations of tropical upper tropospheric
   temperature trends remains an important problem in climate science.
   Examining atmospheric models running over observed sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs), Flannaghan et al. (2014) show that this
   reconciliation is affected by the SST data set used and that a
   precipitation-weighted SST (PSST) is valuable in explaining this result.
   Here we show that even for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
   Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 AMIP) simulations
   forced with identical SSTs, tropical upper tropospheric temperature
   trends across models (and between ensemble members) show a substantial
   spread (standard deviation similar to 10\% of the average trend). About
   60\% of this spread between ensemble means, as well as deviations from
   the ensemble means, can be explained by PSST calculated from the
   time-evolving precipitation in each model run. Both PSST and atmospheric
   temperature trends show statistical evidence for systematic differences
   between models. We conclude that the response of precipitation patterns
   to changes in SST patterns is a significant source of uncertainty for
   tropical temperature trends.},

Title = {Analysis of spatio-temporal precipitation and temperature variability
   and trend over Sudd-Wetland, Republic of South Sudan},
Journal = {CLIMATE SERVICES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {34},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Sudd Wetland, which supports millions of pastoralists and farmers,
   as well as the internationally renowned Ramsar Wetland, are under
   pressure from population growth and climate change extremes such as
   flooding and drought. Using the Climate Hazards Group Infrareds
   Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Climate Research Unit
   (CRU-TS4.06) datasets, this study investigates the spatiotemporal trend
   and variability of precipitation and temperature. As a result,
   descriptive statistics were used to describe the spatiotemporal behavior
   of precipitation and temperature. The Rotated Empirical Orthogonal
   Function (REOF) was used to detect the spatiotemporal variability of
   precipitation. The Pearson correlation method was used to investigate
   the relationship between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and
   precipitation. The results revealed that Sudd-wetland receives 910 mm
   mean spatial annual precipitation and experienced 36 C-degrees mean
   annual temperature with high spatio-temporal variations. It receives the
   highest precipitation in summer season followed by autumn and spring.
   The precipitation amount decreases towards the north in all seasons. In
   both the summer and winter seasons, observed rainfall variability
   corresponds substantially to ENSO variability, whereas the spring and
   autumn seasons are more connected with Atlantic and Indian Ocean Sea
   surface temperature gradients. The Sudd wetland has been affected by
   prolonged drought and frequent flood events alternatively. The prolonged
   drought linking with the shrinking of the wetland are potential threats
   to the farmers and pastoralists to adapt the changing climate. Hence, it
   is imperative to systematically analyze the wetland ecosystem from
   different dimensions and adjust the livelihood settings of the people in
   to less climate sensitive activities. Therefore, we suggest in depth
   drought and flood risk evaluation and implementation of realistic
   adaptation strategy to sustain the ecological and economic benefit of
   the wetland.},

Title = {Trends and projections of temperature, precipitation, and snow cover
   during snow cover-observed period over southwestern Iran},

Abstract = {In the present study, tendencies in temperature, precipitation, and snow
   cover area over the southwestern part of Iran have been assessed. The
   research mainly focused on snow cover-observed period which included the
   months of December, January, February, March, and April in the area.
   This research has been divided into two parts. First part consists of an
   analysis of the trends in temperature, precipitation, and snow cover
   area during the above months. Trends in these parameters were tested by
   linear regression, and significance was determined by t test.
   Mann-Kendall rank test (MK test) was also employed to confirm the
   results of linear regression. Sequential Mann-Kendall test (SQ-MK test)
   was applied for change point detection in the series. For snow cover
   analysis, remote sensing images from National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) satellite with advanced very high resolution
   radiometer (AVHRR) sensor for the period 1987-2007 were used. The second
   part of the research involved future projections based on four models
   under B1 and A1B emission scenarios. The models used were centre
   national de recherches meteorologiques (CNRM), European Center Hamburg
   model (ECHAM), Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROCH)
   and United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMOC) under the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR4. The analysis of
   temperature trends revealed a significant increase during February and
   April. Temperature projections showed that temperature may increase
   between 1.12 to 7.87 A degrees C by 2100 in the study area. The results
   of precipitation series indicated that majority of the stations
   registered insignificant trends during the twentieth century. However,
   precipitation may decrease according to most of the models under both
   scenarios, but the decrease may not be large, except according to MIROCH
   model. The results of trend analysis of snow cover area indicated that
   no significant trends were detected by any statistical tests at 95 \%
   confidence level during the twentieth century. Snow cover projection
   showed that snow cover area may decrease as indicated by all the models
   under both scenarios at the end of twenty-first century consistent with
   the projected increase in temperature.},

Title = {A new mean-extreme vector for the trends of temperature and

Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {129},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A mean-extreme (M-E) vector is defined to combine the changes of climate
   means and extremes. The direction of the vertical axis represents
   changes in means, whereas the direction of the horizontal axis
   represents changes in extremes. Therefore, the M-E vector can clearly
   reflect both the amplitude and direction of changes in climate means and
   extremes. Nine types of M-E vectors are defined. They are named as MuEu,
   MuEd, MuEz, MdEu, MdEd, MdEz, MzEu, MzEd, and MzEz. Here M and E stand
   for climate means and extremes, respectively, whereas u, d, and z
   indicate an upward, downward trend and no trend, respectively. Both
   temperature mean and extremely high temperature days are consistently
   increased (MuEu) in nearly whole China throughout four seasons. However,
   the MuEd-type vector dominates in some regions. The MuEd-type vector
   appears over the Huang Huai river basin in spring, summer and winter.
   For the M-E vector of temperature mean and extremely low temperature
   days, the MuEd-type spreads the entire China for all seasons. The M-E
   vector for precipitation mean and the extreme precipitation days
   possesses identical trends (MuEu or MdEd) despite of seasons. The
   MuEu-type dominates in northeastern China and west of 105A degrees E in
   spring, northwestern and central/southern China in summer, west of 100A
   degrees E and northeastern China in autumn, and nearly whole China in
   winter. Precipitation mean and extreme precipitation days are all
   decreased (MdEd) in the rest of China for all reasons. The trends
   relationship in means and extremes over China presented herein could
   provide a scientific foundation to predict change of extremes using
   change of mean as the predictor.},

Title = {Recent trends in Inner Asian forest dynamics to temperature and

Abstract = {Semi-arid ecosystems play an important role in regulating global climate
   with the fate of these ecosystems in the Anthropocene depending upon
   interactions among temperature, precipitation, and CO2. However, in
   cool-arid environments, precipitation is not the only limitation to
   forest productivity. Interactions between changes in precipitation and
   air temperature may enhance soil moisture stress while simultaneously
   extending growing season length, with unclear consequences for net
   carbon uptake. This study evaluates recent trends in productivity and
   phenology of Inner Asian forests (in Mongolia and Northern China) using
   satellite remote sensing, dendrochronology, and dynamic global
   vegetation model (DGVM) simulations to quantify the sensitivity of
   forest dynamics to decadal climate variability and trends. Trends in
   photosynthetically active radiation fraction (FPAR) between 1982 and
   2010 show a greening of about 7\% of the region in spring (March, April,
   May), and 3\% of the area `browning' during summertime (June, July,
   August). These satellite observations of FPAR are corroborated by trends
   in NPP simulated by the LPJ DGVM. Spring greening trends in FPAR are
   mainly explained by long-term trends in precipitation whereas summer
   browning trends are correlated with decreasing precipitation. Tree ring
   data from 25 sites confirm annual growth increments are mainly limited
   by summer precipitation (June, July, August) in Mongolia, and spring
   precipitation in northern China (March, April, May), with relatively
   weak prior-year lag effects. An ensemble of climate projections from the
   IPCC CMIP3 models indicates that warming temperatures (spring, summer)
   are expected to be associated with higher summer precipitation, which
   combined with CO2 causes large increases in NPP and possibly even
   greater forest cover in the Mongolian steppe. In the absence of a strong
   direct CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth (e.g., due to nutrient
   limitation), water stress or decreased carbon gain from higher
   autotrophic respiration results in decreased productivity and loss of
   forest cover. The fate of these semi-arid ecosystems thus appears to
   hinge upon the magnitude and subtleties of CO2 fertilization effects,
   for which experimental observations in arid systems are needed to test
   and refine vegetation models. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The Koshi river basin is a sub-basin of the Ganges shared among China,
   Nepal, and India. The river system has a high potential for investment
   in hydropower development and for irrigation in downstream areas. The
   upper part of the basin contains a substantial reserve of freshwater in
   the form of snow and glaciers. Climate variability, climate change, and
   climate extremes might impact on these reserves, and in turn impact on
   systems that support livelihoods, such as agriculture, biodiversity and
   related ecosystem services. Climatological variability and trends over
   the Koshi river basin were studied using RClimDex. Daily temperature
   data (20 stations) and precipitation data (50 stations) from 1975 to
   2010 were used in the analysis. The results show that the frequency and
   intensity of weather extremes are increasing. The daily maximum
   temperature (TXx) increased by 0.1 degrees C decade(-1) on average
   between 1975 and 2010 and the minimum (TNn) by 0.3 degrees C decade(-1).
   The number of warm nights increased at all stations. Most of the extreme
   temperature indices showed a consistently different pattern in the
   mountains than in the Indo-Gangetic plains, although not all results
   were statistically significant. The warm days (TX90p), warm nights
   (TN90p), warm spell duration (WSDI), and diurnal temperature range (DTR)
   increased at most of the mountain stations; whereas monthly maximum and
   minimum values of daily maximum temperature, TX90p, cool nights (TN10p),
   WSDI, cold spell duration indicator (CSDI), DTR decreased at the
   stations in the Indo-Gangetic plains, while the number of cold days
   increased. There was an increase in total annual rainfall and rainfall
   intensity, although no clear long-term linear trend, whereas the number
   of consecutive dry days increased at almost all stations. The results
   indicate that the risk of extreme climate events over the basin is
   increasing, which will increase people's vulnerability and has strong
   policy implications.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal characteristics of temperature and precipitation in
   the Zhujiang River Basin, South China, are analysed in order to identify
   tendencies in dryness and wetness. Trend tests are applied to daily
   temperature and precipitation data from 1961 to 2007 of 192 weather
   stations. Nine indicators are applied in order to detect cycles of
   dryness and wetness and are compared with the drought indices
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
   (PDSI).
   Tendencies in temperature and precipitation characteristics can be
   observed. Significant positive trends (> 90\% confidence level) can be
   found for annual temperature, number of warm days, longest warm period,
   no rain days, and longest dry period. A significant increase in
   temperature by more than 0.7 K from 1961 to 2007 can be observed in the
   entire basin and the coastal and far western areas in particular.
   Negative trends are observed for annual cool days, cool period, wet
   days, and wet period. Almost no significant trends in annual mean and
   extreme precipitation are detected. Rain days decreased, and a tendency
   to longer dry periods and shorter wet periods can be observed.
   The magnitude of indices describing dryness has increased in the
   Zhujiang River Basin, and dry periods have become longer while wet
   periods have shortened in time. Rainfall intensity has increased along
   the coastline and in the far west of the catchment. This tendency can be
   partially explained by the weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon.
   Regarding the high temperature increases, the influences of the urban
   heat island effect due to urbanization and industrialization, especially
   along the coast and at the delta, should be considered. The high station
   density and data quality are very useful for describing detailed changes
   in wetness and dryness in the Zhujiang River basin. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper presents results of trend analysis and change point detection
   of annual and seasonal precipitation, and mean temperature (TM), maximum
   temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature (TMIN) time series of the
   period 1950-2007. Investigations were carried out for 50 precipitation
   stations and 39 temperature stations located in southwest Iran. Three
   statistical tests including Pettitt's test, Sequential Mann-Kendall test
   (SQ-MK test) and Mann Kendall rank test (MK-test) were used for the
   analysis. The results obtained for precipitation series indicated that
   most stations showed insignificant trends in annual and seasonal series.
   Out of the stations which showed significant trends, highest numbers
   were observed during winter season while no significant trends were
   detected in summer precipitation. Moreover, no decreasing significant
   trends were detected by statistical tests in annual and seasonal
   precipitation series. The analysis of temperature trends revealed a
   significant increase during summer and spring seasons. TMAX was more
   stable than TMIN and TM, and winter was stable compared to summer,
   spring and autumn seasons. The results of change point detection
   indicated that most of the positive significant mutation points in TM,
   TMAX and TMIN began in the 1990s.},

Abstract = {We analyse 20th century trends in six indices for precipitation extremes
   and four indices for temperature extremes, calculated from daily
   observational data for European stations. The indices chosen reflect
   rather moderate extremes. Most of the similar to 80 stations used are
   situated in central and western Europe; therefore, results mainly refer
   to this region. Trends are calculated over 1901 -99, 1921 -99, 1901 -50
   and 1946-99. Two different trend estimators are used, and significance
   is assessed with a bootstrap technique. We find that:
   Significant increasing precipitation trends over the 20th century
   dominate in winter for both average precipitation intensity and
   moderately strong events. Simultaneously, the length of dry spells
   generally increased insignificantly.
   There are few significant trends of any sign for precipitation indices
   in summer, but there are insignificant drying trends over Scandinavia
   and wetting trends over central and western Europe for 1921 -99. The
   length of dry spells in summer generally increased insignificantly.
   Both the warm and cold tails of the temperature distribution in winter
   warmed over the entire 20th century. Notably low values in the cold tail
   for daily Tmax and Tmin occurred in the early 1940s, leading to strong
   but insignificant negative trends for 1901-50, whereas little change
   occurred before 1940.
   Warming of winters during 1946-99 occurred in both the warm and cold
   tails for both Tmax and Tmin, with the largest warming in the cold tail
   for Tmin.
   The warm tail of daily Tmin (and to a smaller extent Tmax) in summer
   warmed significantly during the past century. There is more evidence for
   summer warming in the first half of the century compared with the second
   half.
   During 1946-99, the warm tail of daily Tmax in summer was generally
   warming while the cold tail was cooling (both insignificantly).
   More digitized daily observational data from various European
   sub-regions are needed to permit a spatially more extensive analysis of
   changes in climate extremes over the last century. Copyright (C) 2005

Abstract = {Understanding historical trends in temperature, precipitation, and
   runoff is important but incomplete for developing adaptive measures to
   climate change to sustain fragile ecosystems in cold and arid regions,
   including the Balagaer River watershed on the Mongolian Plateau of
   northeast China. The objective of this study was to detect such trends
   in this watershed from 1959 to 2017. The detection was accomplished
   using a Mann-Kendall sudden change approach at annual and seasonal time
   scales. The results indicated that the abrupt changes in temperature
   preceded that in either runoff or precipitation; these abrupt changes
   occurred between 1970 and 2004. Significant (alpha = 0.05) warming
   trends were found at the minimum temperatures in spring (0.041 degrees C
   a(-1)), summer (0.037 degrees C a(-1)), fall (0.027 degrees C a(-1)),
   and winter (0.031 degrees C a(-1)). In contrast, significant decreasing
   trends were found in the precipitation (-1.27 mm a(-1)) and runoff
   (-0.069 mm a(-1)) in the summer. Marginally increasing trends were found
   in the precipitation in spring (0.18 mm a(-1)) and fall (0.032 mm
   a(-1)), whereas an insignificant decreasing trend was found in the
   runoffs in these two seasons. Both precipitation and runoff in the wet
   season exhibited a significant decreasing trend, whereas in the dry
   season, they exhibited a marginally increasing trend. Sudden changes in
   spring runoff and sudden rises in temperature are the main causes of
   sudden changes in basin rainfall.},

Title = {Impacts of internal variability on temperature and precipitation trends
   in large ensemble simulations by two climate models},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {289-306},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {It is known that internal climate variability (ICV) can influence trends
   seen in observations and individual model simulations over a period of
   decades. This makes it difficult to quantify the forced response to
   external forcing. Here we analyze two large ensembles of simulations
   from 1950 to 2100 by two fully-coupled climate models, namely the CESM1
   and CanESM2, to quantify ICV's influences on estimated trends in annual
   surface air temperature (Tas) and precipitation (P) over different time
   periods. Results show that the observed trends since 1979 in global-mean
   Tas and P are within the spread of the CESM1-simulated trends while the
   CanESM2 overestimates the historical changes, likely due to its
   deficiencies in simulating historical non-CO2 forcing. Both models show
   considerable spreads in the Tas and P trends among the individual
   simulations, and the spreads decrease rapidly as the record length
   increases to about 40 (50) years for global-mean Tas (P). Because of
   ICV, local and regional P trends may remain statistically insignificant
   and differ greatly among individual model simulations over most of the
   globe until the later part of the twenty-first century even under a high
   emissions scenario, while local Tas trends since 1979 are already
   statistically significant over many low-latitude regions and are
   projected to become significant over most of the globe by the 2030s. The
   largest influences of ICV come from the Inter-decadal Pacific
   Oscillation and polar sea ice. In contrast to the realization-dependent
   ICV, the forced Tas response to external forcing has a temporal
   evolution that is similar over most of the globe (except its amplitude).
   For annual precipitation, however, the temporal evolution of the forced
   response is similar (opposite) to that of Tas over many mid-high
   latitude areas and the ITCZ (subtropical regions), but close to zero
   over the transition zones between the regions with positive and negative
   trends. The ICV in the transient climate change simulations is slightly
   larger than that in the control run for P (and other related variables
   such as water vapor), but similar for Tas. Thus, the ICV for P from a
   control run may need to be scaled up in detection and attribution
   analyses.},

Abstract = {Iraq is classified as the fifth most vulnerable country in the world to
   decreased water and food availability, extreme temperatures, and
   associated health problems. The current study aims to analyze the
   historical and current climate of Iraq by studying the climatic
   characteristics of annual, monthly, and seasonal averages of temperature
   and precipitation for the observed period 1971-2020. The Coupled Global
   Climate Model (CCSM3) based on the National Center for Atmospheric
   (NCAR) used to study the changes of temperature and precipitation during
   the twenty-first century, under the Special Report on Emissions
   Scenarios (SRES), which includes the low B1, medium A1B, and high A2
   future emission scenarios. During 1971-2020, the results showed that the
   temperature anomaly increased to +2.1 degrees C, and precipitation
   anomaly decreased to -84 mm in 2020, especially in the last decade of
   the twentieth century, due to drought and increase temperature and
   climate change consequences. The southern and southwestern regions of
   Iraq are the most affected by both high temperatures and lack of
   precipitation. The temperature is projected to increase by 0.4 degrees
   C, 1.2 degrees C, and 2.4 degrees C for B1, A1B, and A2, respectively,
   in 2099, while the precipitation is projected to greatest decrease under
   A1B from 121 mm in 2050 to 104 mm in 2099. Understanding and predicting
   climate change is vital to clarifying its potential future consequences
   for society and policy-making, as Iraq is one of the five most

Abstract = {This work investigates seasonal and annual trends of temperature and
   precipitation from 1951/1971 to 2007 in the south-eastern part of
   Styria, Austria. Linear trends are calculated by least squares
   regression and analyzed for single station records and two different
   area-average time series. The focus area is represented by a regional
   mean and the two single stations Bad Gleichenberg and Gleisdorf. The
   regional mean over the focus area is calculated on the basis of
   seventeen stations in total previously tested by the standard normal
   homogeneity test. Changes in south-eastern Styria are compared with the
   urban station Graz University and with trends on a larger scale by the
   supra-regional mean over a greater territory north-east of the Alpine
   crest. In addition, some information regarding the sensitivity of linear
   trends is briefly discussed. The results reflect the warming in the
   20(th) century and its acceleration since the 1950s and, in particular,
   since the 1970s. In the period from 1971 to 2007, significant trends are
   detected on annual and seasonal scales, except for winter temperatures.
   Similar trends are observed in spring and autumn (similar to 1.8 degrees
   C) but the maximum increase occured in summer (similar to 2.5 degrees
   C). For precipitation, annual data as well as the summer and winter
   seasons show a decreasing tendency from 1951 to 2007 and from 1971 to
   2007. Although spring and autumn conditions are characterized by a much
   higher spatial variability, the regional mean over the focus area
   indicates an increase from 1971 to 2007. The findings of the present
   study illustrate south-eastern Styria as a region of high sensitivity to
   global warming. In particular since the 1970s, the changes in
   temperature and precipitation are an enhanced reflection of the
   large-scale trends.},

Abstract = {The regional observed temperature and precipitation changes and their
   abrupt jumps disturbed by large-scale reclamation in the Sanjiang Plain,
   Northeast China were studied. Mean annual temperature of the region was
   tending to go up and has increased by 1.2-2.2 degrees C over the past 50
   years. A warming jump of mean annual temperature of the region occurred
   in the 1980s, which had an increase amplitude of 0.9 degrees C. Linear
   tendency rates of annual precipitation were negative in most of the
   region. The maximum of annual precipitation decrease was 155.8mm over
   the past 50 years. An abrupt decrease of regional annual precipitation
   happened in the middle of the 1960s, which had a decrease of 102.1 mm.
   Based on the fact of climatic change of the Sanjiang Plain over the past
   50 years, it is held that the region had larger warming amplitude than
   that of the surrounding areas in the recent years, which resulted from
   the large-scale reclamation of various kinds of wetlands.},

Abstract = {The analysis of a territory's climate trends are currently major
   research interests, as this is a viable method for identifying changes
   in climatic parameters against the background of global climate change,
   which at the same time can provide basic support for environmental
   system adjustments. The present study aims to identify the temporal
   trends of the main climate parameters (temperature, precipitation and
   potential evapotranspiration) in southern Oltenia, based on climate data
   provided by five regional weather stations (Drobeta Turnu Severin,
   Calafat, Craiova, Bechet and Turnu Magurele). The analysis covers the
   1961 - 2009 period, and the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was used as
   trend quantification method. The entire study was conducted on three
   temporal analysis scales - annual, seasonal (spring, summer, autumn and
   winter) and monthly. The results showed specificities for each climatic
   parameter on each of the three temporal scales. For the average
   temperature, trends are mainly upward on annual and seasonal scales
   (generally statistically significant), except for autumn, when a slight
   cooling trend lacking statistical significance was found. The same
   general pattern was identified for evapotranspiration, save for the fact
   that autumn's negative trends are statistically relevant. For rainfall,
   while trends are generally decreasing annually and seasonally, except
   for autumn (characterized by positive trends), its dynamics status is
   uncertain as a result of the general lack of statistical significance.
   The monthly regime analysis revealed visibly more pronounced trend
   dynamics for all three climatic parameters.},

Abstract = {Trends in near-surface air temperature and precipitation over South
   America are examined for the periods 1975-2004 and 1955-2004,
   respectively, using multiple observational and climate model data sets.
   The results for observed near-surface air temperature show an overall
   warming trend over much of the continent, with the largest magnitudes
   over central Brazil. These observed trends are found to be statistically
   significant using pre-industrial control simulations from the fifth
   phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as the
   baseline to estimate natural climate variability. The observed trends
   are compared with those obtained in natural-only CMIP5 simulations, in
   which only natural forcings (i.e. volcanoes and solar variability) are
   included, and in historical CMIP5 simulations, in which anthropogenic
   forcings (i.e. changes in the atmospheric composition) are further
   incorporated. The historical CMIP5 simulations are more successful in
   capturing the observed temperature trends than the simulations with
   natural forcings only. It is suggested that anthropogenic warming is
   already evident over much of South America. Unlike the warming trends,
   observed precipitation trends over South America are less spatially
   coherent with both negative and positive values across the continent.
   Significant positive trends are found over South America in only one of
   the data sets used, and over a region that roughly encompasses the
   southern part of La Plata Basin (southern Brazil, Uruguay, and
   northeastern Argentina) in all data sets used. The historical CMIP5
   simulations do not capture this feature. No firm conclusions are
   reached, therefore, for anthropogenic influences on precipitation
   changes in the period selected for study.},

Abstract = {Considering the linkages between climate change and water management, a
   lack of effort has been observed in analyzing the imprints of climate
   change over the transboundary Teesta river basin, where the changing
   climatic conditions can trigger substantial changes in eco-hydrological
   and socio-politico-economic setups. Therefore, to stimulate effective
   basin management, we investigated the trends in temperature,
   precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and water availability
   under 1.5 and 2 degrees C warming levels across the transboundary Teesta
   river basin. The ensemble median of five bias-corrected model outputs
   from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) was used
   for this purpose. The results indicate that the temperature is expected
   to significantly increase (decrease) in the near (far) future, along
   with an overall significant increasing trend in monsoon precipitation.
   The evaporation paradox is found in the near future, and the water
   availability is likely to increase, with some exceptions for the
   pre-monsoon season. The perpetuation of such changes might result in
   environmental degradation through snow melting, glacial recession, and
   floods. Anticipating the changing climatic scenarios and their possible
   impacts, in this study, we recommend a variety of short- and long-term
   strategies for the concerned stakeholders to implement the Sustainable
   Development Goal 13, i.e., ``Climate Action{''}, over the Teesta river
   basin.},

Abstract = {Extreme climate events often have a significant and direct impact on
   social, economic, and environmental systems. This study is an attempt to
   characterize the current trends and future projections of extreme
   climatic indices in an arid region of Morocco on both an annual and a
   seasonal scale using 12 precipitation and temperature-based indices. The
   Mann-Kendall test was used to assess the trends, and the inverse
   distance weighted interpolation method was employed to analyze the
   spatial distribution of extreme precipitation indices. The results
   showed that the most extreme climate indices are spatially distributed
   with a clear gradient from the mountainous area toward the plains.
   Furthermore, the analysis indicates nonsignificant downward trends in
   the number of days with a rainfall amount greater than 10 or 20 mm.
   However, a significant negative trend in the consecutive dry days was
   observed at the Iloujdane and Sidi Bouathmane stations. The temperature
   indices have recorded statistically significant upward trends at all the
   stations. Finally, based on the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, future
   climate change simulations show, respectively, annual precipitation
   decreases of 23 and 34\% and temperature increases of 1.9 and 2.8
   degrees C, which could imply substantial losses of cereal yield in the
   rainfed agriculture.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have recently shown the effects of global warming on
   worldwide and regional precipitation and temperature patterns. Despite
   knowing that the spatial and temporal impact of climate variability on
   agricultural production on different scales is substantial, few studies
   have addressed the effect of climate change on crop yield. This study
   aimed to provide information on regional trends by evaluating ETCCDMI
   extreme indices based on long-term (from 1970 to 2015), multi-station
   (57 weather stations), daily air temperature, and precipitation
   observations across the state of Nebraska located in the Central Great
   Plains, USA. We analyzed climate variability's spatial and temporal
   impact on agricultural production since agriculture is the most
   important economic sector for Nebraska. A predominant increase in mean
   maximum and minimum temperatures in Nebraska in the last four decades
   was observed with a nighttime warming trend. The extreme maximum
   temperatures and diurnal temperature range indices are environmental
   factors that negatively impact the rainfed crop production in Nebraska.
   As expected, the extreme precipitation events indices showed significant
   positive correlations with the rainfed crop yield. Further research is
   needed to evaluate the effect of extreme temperatures on plant growth at
   different phenological stages and its impact on productivity.},

Abstract = {Using station data from the United States Historical Climatology
   Network, we preformed a running trend analysis of temperature,
   precipitation and drought in the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and
   Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river basins for the time period
   1895-2012 on annual and monthly timescales.
   Our study found that long-term precipitation and temperature trends were
   statistically detectible but relatively slight in the order of an
   increase at 3mm per decade for precipitation and a decline of 0.02
   degrees C per decade for temperature. Running trend analyses for the
   time period 1895-2012 found field-significant and relatively large
   annual precipitation increases and temperature decreases between the
   1950s and early 1980s associated with the `warming hole'. The magnitude
   of precipitation trends for the aforementioned period was in the range
   of 7mm per year for precipitation and 0.6 degrees C per decade for
   temperature. For temperature, we observed generally decreasing maximum,
   minimum and mean temperatures in the 1960s and 1970s and increasing
   temperatures from the 1970s to present. Minimum temperatures
   particularly showed a strong increase in recent summer months in the
   range of 0.3 degrees C per decade.
   Trends in the diurnal temperature range showed a recent narrowing during
   summer and fall months. Differences in the standardized precipitation
   index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index
   (SPEI) did not show a strong effect of temperature on drought for this
   region.},

Abstract = {Vegetation plays a crucial role in providing organic matter and
   regulating energy exchange on the Earth's surface. This study
   investigates the changes in vegetation cover, temperature, and
   precipitation in northeastern Iran during 2001-2020. MODIS-NDVI time
   series data and climatic data from 11 synoptic stations were utilized.
   The nonparametric Mann-Kendall method was employed to detect trends in
   vegetation cover and climatic variables. Additionally, the correlation
   between climatic parameters and vegetation was examined. Trend analysis
   revealed significant increases/decreases in vegetation cover in
   32\%/26\% of the region, respectively. The increasing trend in
   vegetation cover was predominantly observed in highlands, suggesting
   that a warmer climate has enhanced the living conditions for plants in
   these regions. The vegetation trend map indicates an expansion of
   vegetation cover in the northern and central parts of Iran during the
   past 20 years, whereas the southern and eastern portions experienced
   declines. The relationship between vegetation and elevation revealed
   that vegetation increased above 1,850 m and decreased below 850 m. Trend
   analysis showed no significant trend in precipitation data since the
   beginning of the twenty-first century, but an increasing trend in
   temperature was observed in 82\% of the region's area, excluding the
   western strip. Correlation coefficients between temperature,
   precipitation, and vegetation indicated that declining temperatures are
   the limiting factors for vegetation in the highlands, while in lowland
   areas, the decrease in precipitation significantly diminishes vegetation
   growth.},

Title = {A spatiotemporal analysis of Midwest US temperature and precipitation

Abstract = {Since late 1970s, climate warming has been widely recognized. In the
   Midwest, farmers cannot rely on the normal calendar anymore, and it has
   become critically necessary to evaluate the most recent climate trends
   relative to growing season in order to conduct adaptation efforts for
   agriculture. Based on the homogenized historical monthly temperature and
   precipitation records during the period of 1980-2013 from 302 observing
   stations in the 12 Midwestern US states, we investigate the climate
   trends on four timescales: monthly, early growing season, late growing
   season, and the entire growing season. The climate metrics include
   maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, diurnal
   temperature range, and precipitation. Nonparametric Sen's Slope together
   with the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test is used to estimate the decadal
   trend and to detect the statistical significance. The results show that
   growing season average temperature has increased at a rate of 0.15
   degrees C decade(-1) over the Midwest United States. Within the growing
   season, minimum temperature is increasing faster in the early growing
   season, especially in June, while maximum temperature is increasing
   faster in the late growing season, especially in September. Spatially,
   statistically significant (p <= 0.05) growing season warming is more
   focused in the southern part of the region in the early growing season
   but in the northern part of the region in the late growing season. Over
   the Midwest, dominant trends in diurnal temperature range are decreasing
   during most months, with the exception of September. The majority of the
   locations show increasing trends in growing season precipitation, yet
   few are statistically significant. Furthermore, precipitation has been
   increasing in the early growing season but decreasing in the late
   growing season. This within-season reversing trend in precipitation is
   found in 8 of 12 Corn Belt states: Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota,
   Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.},

Abstract = {The evolution of daily extreme precipitation and temperature from 1958
   to 2001 was investigated within the German side of the Rhine basin.
   Trends of a set of extreme precipitation and temperature indices defined
   on daily time series of precipitation and temperature were calculated at
   611 precipitation and 232 temperature stations located within the study
   area and their corresponding Significances were tested using the
   non-parametric Kendall- tau test. The results obtained indicated that
   both the daily minimum and maximum extreme temperatures have increased
   over the investigation period, with the degree of change showing
   seasonal variability. On an annual basis, the change in the daily
   minimum extreme temperature was found to be greater than that of the
   daily maximum extreme temperature. The daily extreme heavy precipitation
   has shown increasing trends both in magnitude and frequency of
   occurrence in all seasons except summer, where it showed the opposite
   trend. The station values of the daily precipitation were also
   interpolated on a regular grid of 5 km x 5 km so that the changes in the
   indices could be investigated on areal precipitation by aggregating the
   interpolated precipitation to any desired scale. This enables assessment
   of the hydrological consequences of the changes in the extreme
   precipitation. Although the spatial pattern remained more or less
   similar with that of the point-scale trends for all indices, the average
   trend magnitude showed an increase with the scale of the area on which
   precipitation was aggregated. Copyright (C) 2005 Royal Meteorological

   A case study of temperature and precipitation},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Trend testing is essential for time sequence analysis. However, the
   existing trend testing methods mainly study the trends of the sequence
   as a whole, while there is a lack of feasible research tools for the
   internal trends of the sequence. Therefore, a non-parametric method was
   proposed to study the overall and internal trends of the sequence using
   the ideas of set pair, Cox-Stuart, Innovative Trend Analysis
   Methodology, and Mann-Kendall and applied to temperature and
   precipitation sequences. The applied study indicated that the overall
   and internal trends for global temperature were significantly increasing
   at the confidence level of alpha = 0.05. For precipitation, the trends
   (both overall and internal) of Laifeng and Leibo were increasing and
   decreasing, respectively, and some of the internal trends were
   significant (alpha = 0.05); however, the overall and internal trends of
   Pingbian and Sangzhi were not exactly the same, i.e., the trend of high
   (low) values in Pingbian (Sangzhi) was different from the other trends
   of the rest. In general, the method successfully tested not only the
   overall trends in temperature and precipitation, but also their internal
   (divided into low, middle, and high values) trends. These results agreed
   with the linear slope, Sen's slope, Mann-Kendall, and its improved.

Abstract = {Earth's average air temperature is warming at a substantial rate leading
   to an increase in the frequency and severity of extremes with major
   environmental and socio-economic impacts. The present study discusses
   temperature and precipitation extremes in Kashmir Valley using
   observational data from six meteorological stations. An Expert Team on
   Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI)
   (http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/) provides 25 extreme climate indices
   (15 for temperature and 10 for precipitation) to be used. The absolute
   extreme temperature indices (TXx, TXn, TNx, and TNn) exhibit increasing
   tendencies, according to the findings. The number of changes witnessed
   in daily maximum temperature was greater than the daily minimum
   temperature which was manifested by increasing diurnal temperature range
   (DTR; 0.012 degrees C/year). These changes in extremes have impacts that
   pose a threat to agriculture, snow day and cover, glaciers, water
   resources, ecosystem services, etc. of the study region. The region is
   undergoing significant urban and land system changes making it further
   vulnerable to natural hazards. The findings are expected to further
   augment the hazard and risk analysis and the necessary disaster risk
   reduction measures for climate-related disasters in the region. These
   analyses will be helpful for the development of strategies for climate
   risk management in Kashmir.},

Title = {Vegetation Greenness Trend in Dry Seasons and Its Responses to
   Temperature and Precipitation in Mara River Basin, Africa},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The Mara River Basin of Africa has a world-famous ecosystem with vast
   vegetation, which is home to many wild animals. However, the basin is
   experiencing vegetation degradation and bad climate change, which has
   caused conflicts between people and wild animals, especially in dry
   seasons. This paper studied the vegetation greenness (VG), vegetation
   greenness trends (VGT), and their responses to climate change in dry
   seasons in the Mara River Basin, Africa. Firstly, based on Google Earth
   Engine (GEE) platform and Sentinel-2 images, the vegetation distribution
   map of the Mara River Basin was drawn. Then dry seasons MODIS NDVI data
   (January to February and June to September) were used to analyze the
   VGT. Finally, a random forest regression algorithm was used to evaluate
   the response of VG and VGT to temperature and precipitation derived from
   ERA5 from 2000 to 2019 at a resolution of 250 m. The results showed that
   the VGT was fluctuating in dry seasons, and the spatial differentiation
   was obvious. The greenness increasing trends both upstream and
   downstream were significantly larger than that of in the midstream. The
   responses of VG to precipitation were almost twice larger than
   temperature, and the responses of VGT to temperature were about 1.5
   times larger than precipitation. The climate change trend of rising
   temperature and falling precipitation will lead to the degradation of
   vegetation and the reduction of crop production. There will be a
   vegetation degradation crisis in dry seasons in the Mara River Basin in
   the future. Identifying the spatiotemporal changes of VGT in dry seasons
   will be helpful to understand the response of VG and VGT to climate
   change and could also provide technical support to cope with
   climate-change-related issues for the basin.},

Abstract = {The study assesses trends of precipitation and temperature extremes over
   Malawi and Mozambique from 1981 to 2020, based on model data and
   observations. Decadal precipitation trends during the primary rainfall
   season were analyzed using Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation
   with Station data (CHIRPS) and Climate Research Unit (CRU). The spatial
   and temporal trends of wet and dry anomalies were examined using
   Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). NASA's
   NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 downscaled data was also analyzed to examine projected
   temperature trends up to 2050. Clear decadal trends were manifested
   using monthly and seasonal mean precipitation. Seasonal mean
   precipitation trends showed consistent decade-to-decade drying over
   northeastern region (CHIRPS), whereas CRU data show patches of dry
   conditions across the entire study domain, including southern parts
   despite increased frequency of tropical cyclones and associated floods
   during recent decades. The 6-12-month SPEI series also show consistent
   dry conditions especially over Malawi from 1981, with a peak during
   1990-2000. This contrasts with the earlier decades, especially the 1960s
   which mostly experienced wetter conditions. The decadal differences with
   reference to 1961-2020 average, using 3-month SPEI, also show consistent
   drying particularly along the coast of Mozambique. Over Malawi, drier
   conditions were dominant in the northern region, while the southern
   region experienced relatively wetter conditions. With respect to
   temperature, the NEX-GDDP historical trends are consistent with CRU from
   1981 to 2015. The projected mean temperature trends show consistent
   increase for all the 4 downscaled CMIP6 models, and for both SSP-245 and
   SSP-585 scenarios especially in the northern and southern parts of
   Malawi.},

Abstract = {The ability of the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project (CMIP5) to reproduce twentieth-century climate trends over the
   seven CONUS regions of the National Climate Assessment is evaluated.
   This evaluation is carried out for summer and winter for three time
   periods, 1895-1939, 1940-1979, and 1980-2005. The evaluation includes
   all 206 CMIP5 historical simulations from 48 unique models and their
   multi-model ensemble (MME), as well as a gridded in situ dataset of
   surface air temperature and precipitation. Analysis is performed on both
   individual members and the MME, and considers reproducing the correct
   sign of the trends by the members as well as reproducing the trend
   values. While the MME exhibits some trend bias in most cases, it
   reproduces historical temperature trends with reasonable fidelity for
   summer for all time periods and all regions, including at the CONUS
   scale, except the Northern Great Plains from 1895 to 1939 and Southeast
   during 1980-2005. Likewise, for DJF, the MME reproduces historical
   temperature trends across all time periods over all regions, including
   at the CONUS scale, except the Southeast from 1895 to 1939 and the
   Midwest during 1940-1979. Model skill was highest across all of the
   seven regions during JJA and DJF for the 1980-2005 period. The
   quantitatively best result is seen during DJF in the Southwest region
   with at least 74\% of the ensemble members correctly reproducing the
   observed trend across all of the time periods. No clear trends in MME
   precipitation were identified at these scales due to high model
   precipitation variability.},

Abstract = {Understanding the impacts of future climate change in Kansas is
   important for agricultural and other socioeconomic sectors in the
   region. To quantify these impacts, seasonal trends in air temperature
   and precipitation patterns from decadally averaged monthly output of 21
   global climate models under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
   AIB scenario used in the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change
   Assessment Report 4 are examined for six grid cells representing Kansas.
   To ascertain the performance of the models, we compared model output to
   kriged meteorological data from stations in the Global Historical
   Climate Network for the period from 1950 to 2000. Agreement between
   multimodel ensemble mean output and observations is very good for
   temperature (r(2) all more than 0.99, root mean square errors range from
   0.84 to 1.48 degrees C) and flood for precipitation (r(2) ranging
   between 0.64 and 0.89, root mean square errors range from 322 to 1144
   mm). Seasonal trends for the second half of the 20th century are
   generally not observed except in modelled temperature trends. Linear
   trends for the 21st century are significant for all seasons in all grid
   cells for temperature and many for precipitation. Results indicate that
   temperatures are likely to warm in all seasons, with the largest trends
   being on the order of 0.04 degrees C/year in summer and fall.
   Precipitation is likely to increase slightly in winter and decrease in
   summer and fall. These changes have profound implications for both
   natural ecosystems and agricultural land uses in the region. Copyright

Abstract = {This study first developed a comprehensive semiautomatic data
   homogenization procedure to produce gap-infilled and homogenized monthly
   precipitation data series for 425 long-term/critical stations in Canada,
   which were then used to assess Canadian historical precipitation trends.
   Data gaps in the 425 series were infilled by advanced spatial
   inter-polation of a much larger dataset. The homogenization procedure
   repeatedly used multiple homogeneity tests without and with reference
   series to identify changepoints/inhomogeneities, the results from which
   were finalized by manual analysis using metadata and visual inspection
   of the multiphase regression fits. As a result, 298 out of the 425 data
   series were found to be inhomogeneous. These series were homogenized
   using quantile matching adjustments. The homogenized dataset shows
   better spatial consistency of trends than does the raw dataset. The
   improved gridding and regional mean trend esti-mation methods also
   provide more realistic trend estimates. With these improvements,
   Canadian historical precipitation trends were found to be dominantly
   positive and significant, except in central-south Canada where the
   trends are generally insignificant and small with mixed directions. For
   annual precipitation, the largest increases are seen in southeastern
   Canada and along the Pacific coast; however, the largest relative
   increases (in percent of the 1961-90 mean) are seen in northern Canada.
   The largest trend difference between northern and southern Canada is
   seen in winter, in which significant increases in the north were matched
   with significant decreases in the south.},

Title = {Trends and periodicity of daily temperature and precipitation extremes

Volume = {132},

Abstract = {In this study, the trends and periodicity in climate extremes are
   examined in Hunan Province over the period 1960-2013 on the basis of 27
   extreme climate indices calculated from daily temperature and
   precipitation records at 89 meteorological stations. The results show
   that in the whole province, temperature extremes exhibit a warming trend
   with more than 50\% stations being statistically significant for 7 out
   of 16 temperature indices, and the nighttime temperature increases
   faster than the daytime temperature at the annual scale. The changes in
   most extreme temperature indices show strongly coherent spatial
   patterns. Moreover, the change rates of almost all temperature indices
   in north Hunan are greater than those of other regions. However, the
   statistically significant changes in indices of extreme precipitation
   are observed at fewer stations than in extreme temperature indices,
   forming less spatially coherent patterns. Positive trends in indices of
   extreme precipitation show that the amount and intensity of extreme
   precipitation events are generally increasing in both annual and
   seasonal scales, whereas the significant downward trend in consecutive
   wet days indicates that the precipitation becomes more even over the
   study period. Analysis of changes in probability distributions of
   extreme indices for 1960-1986 and 1987-2013 also demonstrates a
   remarkable shift toward warmer condition and increasing tendency in the
   amount and intensity of extreme precipitation during the past decades.
   The variations in extreme climate indices exhibit inconstant frequencies
   in the wavelet power spectrum. Among the 16 temperature indices, 2 of
   them show significant 1-year periodic oscillation and 7 of them exhibit
   significant 4-year cycle during some certain periods. However,
   significant periodic oscillations can be found in all of the
   precipitation indices. Wet-day precipitation and three absolute
   precipitation indices show significant 1-year cycle and other seven
   provide significant power at the 4-year period, which are mainly found
   during 1970-1980 and after 1992.},

   Extremes in Different Agroecologies of Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia},

Abstract = {Ethiopian climate-sensitive economy is particularly vulnerable to the
   effects of climate-related extreme events. Thus, examining extreme daily
   precipitation and temperature in the context of climate change is a
   critical factor in advocating climate change adaptation at the local
   scales. Spatial changes of climate indices for extreme precipitation and
   temperatures were conducted for the period 1986-2016 in three different
   agroecologies of the Gurage zone, Southern Ethiopia. The study used the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator to estimate the trend
   and magnitude of changes in precipitation and temperature. The analysis
   from the observation indicates that there had been a consistent warming
   trend and inconsistent changes in precipitation extremes in the study
   agroecologies. A statistically significant increase in the numbers of
   warm days and nights and a statistically significant reduction in the
   numbers of cold days and nights were observed in most of the
   agroecologies. The duration of extreme trend showed inconsistency;
   however, a drier condition is observed in lowland agroecology.
   Therefore, based on the findings of this study, appropriate climate
   adaptation efforts are needed at the local scale.},

   Analysis of Temperature, Precipitation, and River Discharge},
Journal = {WATER},

Abstract = {Floods in Germany have become increasingly frequent and severe over
   recent decades, with notable events in 2002, 2013, and 2021. This study
   examines the trends and drivers of flood occurrences in Germany from
   1990 to 2024, focusing on the influence of climate-change-related
   variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and river discharge.
   Using a comprehensive time series analysis, including Auto-Regressive
   Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   models and correlation and regression analyses, we identify significant
   correlations between these climatic variables and flood events. Our
   findings indicate that rising temperatures (with a mean of 8.46 degrees
   C and a maximum of 9 degrees C) and increased precipitation (averaging
   862.26 mm annually)are strongly associated with higher river discharge
   (mean 214.6 m3/s) and more frequent floods (mean 197.94 events per
   year). The ANN model outperformed the ARIMA model in flood forecasting,
   showing lower error metrics (e.g., RMSE of 10.86 vs. 18.83). The
   analysis underscores the critical impact of climate change on flood
   risks, highlighting the necessity of adaptive flood-management
   strategies that incorporate the latest climatic and socio-economic data.
   This research contributes to the understanding of flood dynamics in
   Germany and provides valuable insights into future flood risks.
   Combining flood management with groundwater recharge could effectively
   lower flood risks and enhance water resources' mitigation and
   management.},

Abstract = {This study analyses spatio-temporal trends in precipitation,
   temperature, and river discharge in the northeast of Iran during recent
   decades (1953-2013). The Pettitt, SNHT, Buishand, Box-Pierce, Ljung-Box,
   and McLeod-Li methods were applied to examine homogeneity in time series
   studied. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator tests
   were used to detect possible significant (p < 0.05) temporal trends in
   hydrometeorological time series and their magnitude, respectively. For
   time series with autocorrelation, the trend-free pre-whitening (TFPW)
   method was used to determine significant trends. To explore spatial
   distributions of trends, their magnitudes were interpolated by the
   inverse distance whitening (IDW) method. Trend analysis shows that for
   daily, monthly, and annual precipitation time series, 12.5, 19, and 12.5
   \% of the stations revealed significant increasing trends, respectively.
   For mean temperature, warming trends were found at 38, 23, and 31 \% of
   the stations on daily, monthly, and annual timescales, in turn. Daily
   and monthly river discharge decreased at 80 and 40 \% of the stations.
   Overall, these results indicate significant increases in precipitation
   and temperature but decreases in river discharge during recent decades.
   Hence, it can be concluded that decreasing trends in river discharge
   time series over the northeast of Iran during 1953-2013 are in response
   to warming temperatures, which increase the rate of evapotranspiration.
   Differences between the results of our comprehensive large-scale study
   and those of previous researches confirm the necessity for more
   model-based local studies on climatic and environmental changes across
   the northeast of Iran.},

Abstract = {Geographical distributions of trends in climate indices with statistical
   significance in Japan are investigated at each of the 51 observation
   stations for the recent 120 years. We employed a comprehensive set of
   the 70 climate indices on an annual timescale to detect climate changes
   and to facilitate climate information for a variety of sectors, which
   are developed by expert team on sector-specific indices in the World
   Meteorological Organization. The rising trends have regional differences
   such as the annual mean of daily maximum and minimum surface air
   temperatures in the Kanto-Koushin region. The statistically significant
   increasing trends in three daily heavy precipitation-relevant climate
   indices, R95p, R99p, and RX1day, are seen in Hokuriku, Shikoku, the
   western part of Northern and Southern Kyusyu regions, and isolated
   stations in the other regions. Rotational empirical orthogonal function
   analysis of R99p revealed different features of statistically
   significant modes suggesting the trends are attributed to changes in
   different atmospheric phenomena as well as those of warm spell duration
   index. The number of the stations with statistically significant trends
   varies with an index. Indies relevant to daily minimum surface air
   temperatures have statistically significant trends at most of the 51
   stations. Consecutive dry days are the most sensitive to climate changes
   for the 120 years among the indices relevant to precipitation in this
   analysis. The indices relevant to heavy precipitation are not always
   been most sensitive to climate change detections in Japan. The
   geographical distributions of the percentage of the number of indices
   with statistically significant changes to the total number of the
   stations provide information about stations sensitive to climate
   changes. The highest sensitivity is seen at Kumamoto. These results
   directly provide detection of climate changes and show the potentials of
   which index is sensitive to ongoing climate changes from the viewpoint
   of geographical distributions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Climate change is a pressing issue that is affecting the lives and
   livelihoods of millions of people across the world. This study
   investigates the trend analysis and spatial-temporal variations of
   temperature and precipitation on a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis
   in Rajasthan state, India, over the past 40 years (1981-2020). The trend
   analysis of temperature and precipitation were analysed using the
   Mann-Kendall test at the confidence level of 95\%. The magnitude (slope)
   was determined by using Theil-Sen's slope test. The results of the
   analysis revealed significant positive and negative trends of
   temperature and precipitation observed on a monthly, seasonal, and
   annual basis in all the 33 districts of Rajasthan state. The summer
   season experienced the maximum average temperature, while the winter
   season had the minimum. The study also found that the northern and
   western parts of Rajasthan experience ``Mawat{''} rain during the winter
   due to cyclones happening in the Mediterranean Sea during that season.
   The annual average temperature and precipitation were observed to be
   maximum in the southern part and minimum in the northern and western

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of temperature
   increases and irregular rainfall distribution, associated with climate
   change, on water availability for rainfed vineyards cultivated in a
   Mediterranean climate area. The study includes the analysis of the
   interrelations between precipitation distribution, temperature,
   evapotranspiration and runoff rates, and the resulting water storage in
   vineyards soils of the Penedes region (NE Spain). A hierarchical cluster
   analysis was applied to classify the years according to water
   availability. The influence of water stored into the soil on yield for
   some one of the main vine varieties cultivated in the area is analysed.
   A vineyard, representative of the land management practices in this
   area, was selected for soil moisture monitoring and runoff evaluations,
   as well as for grape yield, which was compared with yields recorded in
   other plots.
   According to rainfall distribution and water availability, the 12
   analysed years represent five different situations: wet years with
   positive and negative water balance: dry years; years with average
   annual rainfall but irregularly distributed throughout the year leading
   to a negative water balance: and extreme situations. Significant water
   deficits were observed in years in which total rainfall amount was above
   the annual average in the area, being similar to those observed in dry
   years: in 8 of the 12 analysed years deficits higher than 100 mm (up to
   309 mm) during the growing period (budbreak-harvest) were recorded. At
   annual scale, 42\% of the analysed years recorded deficits ranging
   between 27.7 and 191.4 mm. In the driest years, and those with more
   irregular rainfall distribution, soil moisture contents below the
   wilting point were reached. The high intensity rainfalls, producing
   important runoff losses (in many cases out of the periods in which crop
   water needs are higher), together with the increasing temperature
   trends, which give rise to significant evapotranspiration increases
   (values up to 32\% higher than the average were recorded during the
   study period), are the main responsible factors for the water deficits
   recorded during grape development. Winegrape yield was influenced by the
   water stored into the soil, bloom-veraison or during budbreak-bloom
   depending on the variety. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The effects of increasing sea surface temperature (SST) and aerosol
   loading in a drought region in Southern China are studied using aerosol
   optical depth (AOD), low-level cloud cover (LCC), visibility, and
   precipitation from observed surface data; wind, temperature, specific
   humidity, and geopotential height from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis fields;
   and SST from the NOAA archive data. The results show a warming of the
   SST in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, and a strengthening of
   the West Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) in the early summer during the
   last 40 yr, with the high pressure system extending farther westward
   over the continent in Southern China. Because the early summer average
   temperature contrast between the land and ocean decreased, the
   southwesterly monsoon from the ocean onto mainland China weakened and a
   surface horizontal wind divergence anomaly occurred over Southern China
   stabilizing the boundary layer. Thus, less moisture was transported to
   Southern China, causing a drying trend. Despite this, surface
   observations show that AOD and LCC have increased, while visibility has
   decreased. Precipitation has decreased in this region in the early
   summer, consistent with both the second aerosol indirect effect
   (reduction in precipitation efficiency caused by the more numerous and
   smaller cloud droplets) and dynamically induced changes from convective
   to more stratiform clouds. The second aerosol indirect effect and
   increases in SST and greenhouse gases (GHG) were simulated separately
   with the ECHAM4 general circulation model (GCM). The GCM results suggest
   that both effects contribute to the changes in LCC and precipitation in
   the drought region in Southern China. The flooding trend in Eastern
   China, however, is more likely caused by strengthened convective
   precipitation associated with increases in SST and GHG.},

Title = {CLIMATE REGIONALIZATION AND TRENDS BASED ON DAILY TEMPERATURE AND

Journal = {CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {The south of Pampas (36 degrees 32'-40 degrees 44' S; 63 degrees 24'-60
   degrees 30' W), as most of Argentina, is a semiarid region. Its economy
   is based on rain-fed agriculture and livestock. Traditionally, the
   climate has been studied considering the analyses of monthly and annual
   climate parameters, but there is evidence that in this type of areas,
   the short-term climatic events have a substantial impact on the climate.
   Therefore, this study aimed at developing a climate regionalization from
   the analysis of daily temperature and precipitation extremes in the
   south of the Pampas for the period 1970-2017. Subsequently, it focuses
   on analyzing both trends and breakpoints of these events in the
   different sub-climates. To do so, we applied a Cluster-based Principal
   Component Analyses with a Ward hierarchical supervised method to
   generate a climate regionalization considering 29 daily extreme climatic
   indices and the elevation. We identify four sub-regions, and we analyzed
   trends during 1970-2017, and in the two-time series defined by applying
   breakpoints. Both minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation had
   structural changes in the last 15 years, exposing the region to warming
   and dryness trends. The maximum temperature increases 0.5 degrees
   C,while precipitation decreases 30 mm. The short-term climate
   variability allows us to identify areas climatically more detailed and
   to conclude that the south of the Pampas is characterized by its high
   dependency on short-term climatic events.},

Title = {Separating the Precipitation- and Non-Precipitation- Driven Water
   Storage Trends in China},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is a critical component for sustainable
   societal development and ecosystem cycles. The Gravity Recovery and
   Climate Experiment satellites have tracked changes in global TWS under
   the combined effects of various factors with unprecedented accuracy
   since 2002. In this study, we separate the trends in TWS driven by
   precipitation and non-precipitation factors for the Chinese mainland
   from 2003 to 2016 based on the statistical reconstruction method and
   linear regression and analyze the driving mechanisms combining with
   multi-source data. The results show that: (a) during the study period,
   TWS shows different degrees of increase in most of the Yangtze River
   basin, the northern part of the Tibetan Plateau, and part of the
   Heilongjiang Province, while TWS shows a significant decrease in the
   Tien Shan Mountains, the southeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, and
   the North China Plain; (b) precipitation is one of the dominant factors
   leading to the rise of TWS, and the construction of reservoirs and dams
   also contributes. In contrast, anthropogenic activities (agricultural
   irrigation, industrial water use, etc.) and accelerated glacial melting
   due to global warming are the dominant factors in the decline of water
   storage; (c) the contribution of long-term precipitation change to water
   storage is significantly larger in the northern China region (north of
   the 800 mm isopleth). This study provides a feasible method for
   quantifying the contribution of precipitation and non-precipitation
   factors to TWS, which is meaningful for understanding the impact of
   climate change and anthropogenic factors on water resources.},

Title = {Trends in total precipitation and frequency of daily precipitation

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {18},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1096-1108},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Based on a newly developed daily precipitation dataset of 740 stations
   in China and more robust trend detection techniques, trends in annual
   and seasonal total precipitation and in extreme daily precipitation,
   defined as those larger than its 95th percentile for the year, summer,
   and winter half years, have been assessed for the period 1951-2000.
   Possible links between changes in total precipitation and frequency of
   extremes have also been explored. The results. indicate that there is
   little trend in total precipitation for China as a whole, but there are
   distinctive regional and seasonal patterns of trends. Annual total
   precipitation has significantly decreased over southern northeast China,
   north China, and over the Sichuan Basin but significantly increased in
   western China, the Yangtze River valley, and the southeastern coast. In
   western China, precipitation increase has been observed for both cold
   and warm seasons. However, trends differ from one season to another in
   eastern China. Spring precipitation has increased in southern northeast
   China and north China but decreased significantly in the midreach of the
   Yangzte River. The summer precipitation trend is very similar to that of
   annual totals. Autumn precipitation has generally decreased throughout
   eastern China. In winter, precipitation has significantly decreased over
   the northern part of eastern China but increased in the south. The
   number of rain days has significantly decreased throughout most parts of
   China with northwest China being an exception. Meanwhile, precipitation
   intensity has significantly increased. This suggests that the
   precipitation increase in western China is due to the increase in both
   precipitation frequency and intensity. In eastern China, the impact of
   reduced number of rain days seems to be more dominant in the north while
   the influence of enhanced intensity prevails in the south. Over regions
   with increasing precipitation trends, there have been much higher than
   normal frequency of precipitation extreme events. For example,
   significant increases in extreme precipitation have been found in
   western China, in the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and in
   parts of the southwest and south China coastal area. A significant
   decrease in extremes is observed in north China and the Sichuan Basin.
   Trends in the number of extremes and total precipitation from nonextreme
   events are generally in phase. An exception is southwest China where an
   increase of extreme events is associated with a decrease in total
   nonextreme precipitation.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, precipitation and
   wind speed from 1960 to 2013 at 179 meteorological stations situated in
   the desertification prone region (DPR) of China are analysed using the
   Mann-Kendall test and the Theil-Sen's slope estimator on monthly,
   seasonal and annual timescales. The results indicate that annual mean
   temperature has increased at a rate of 0.33 degrees C (10 year)(-1) over
   the DPR. T-min generally increased at a higher rate than T-max in the
   majority of the months and seasons over the past 54 years; this has
   resulted in a decrease in the diurnal temperature range. Precipitation
   increased for the majority of the meteorological stations in the western
   area of the DPR, and decreased in the eastern area, but few of these
   trends are statistically significant on all timescales. The majority of
   meteorological stations recorded a significant decrease in wind speed at
   the majority of timescales. Results from this investigation show that
   the climate is becoming warmer and wetter in the western area of the
   DPR, and warmer and drier in eastern area of the DPR. A greater
   understanding of how the historical climate has been changing enables
   scientific support for the adaption of mitigation policies for land
   desertification/degradation, water resources, ecological projects and
   agricultural production. These policies will aid in combating the
   desertification processes, maintaining ecological security and promoting
   sustainable development in the DPR.},

Abstract = {Climate change stands as one of the most paramount environmental
   predicaments in the present world. Recent years have seen an escalation
   of climate change into a truly global issue. In light of this, our study
   aims to identify the spatiotemporal patterns of climate change,
   specifically with regards to temperature and precipitation, in Kandy
   district throughout the period spanning 1992 to 2022. By critically
   appraising the contemporaneous situation, the study seeks to provide
   recommendations aimed at curbing the impact of climate change. Another
   relevant study was conducted, focusing on secondary data, mainly
   climatological observations. The current investigation utilised the Sri
   Lanka Metrology Department's spatial trend data administered through the
   IDW method on Arc GIS 10.4. On the other hand, the temporal trend data
   were evaluated using the Mann Kendall trend and Sen's slope estimator
   methods through MiniTab16. The outcomes of this research have been
   presented through the processing of imagery and tabulating data, which
   have been subjected to rigorous statistical analyses. As far as the
   district of Kandy is concerned, the variability of rainfall and
   temperature across different areas is undeniable. The district's average
   temperature lies at 0.516 degrees C, with the average high temperature
   being 0.606 degrees C and the average low temperature being 0.408
   degrees C. Rainfall in Kandy district has intensified to 2604 mm, with
   the Nawalapitiya rainfall observation station showing an increase in
   trend to 2763 mm, while the Duck wary Estate rainfall observation
   station displaying a decreased trend to 996.927 mm. In the monsoon
   season, the south-westerly monsoon season promotes increased rainfall up
   to 1905 mm, while the north-easterly monsoon season loses its previously
   known influence on seasonal rainfall, resulting change.},

Abstract = {The present study attempts to explore the variations and linkages
   between precipitation and temperature and its impact on the Cryosphere
   Himalayan Highland Region (CHHR) and the dynamics of the cryosphere. The
   precipitation and Temperature data between the years 1981 and 2019 have
   been collected and trend analysis is performed using the Mann-Kendell
   trend test (alpha <= 0.05; alpha <= 0.10) and Sen's slope. The
   Precipitation Anomaly Index (PAI) was computed to understand the
   temporal patterns and variations of precipitation and there existed a
   trend in the precipitation over 39 years. Monthly, seasonal and annual
   temperature anomalies were also calculated and it was observed that
   there was a distinct pattern of cooling and warming cycles. Seasonal and
   annual mean temperature and precipitation were calculated using linear
   regression and it was found that R-2 is robust for MAM and JJA seasons.
   The NDSI and LST were computed for which values show that the melting of
   snow has been accelerating over the years. This study is useful for
   developing appropriate strategies to mitigate the adverse impact of
   climate change in the mid-Himalayan region.},

Title = {Assessing the uncertainty of CESM-LE in simulating the trends of mean
   and extreme temperature and precipitation over China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Climate change affects mean and extreme temperature and precipitation,
   increasing the risk of related disasters. Assessing the performance of
   current models in simulating these aspects is therefore crucial to
   future projection and policymaking. Based on a large ensemble (LE; 30
   members) of the Community Earth System Model (CESM-LE), this study seeks
   to answer the following two questions: (1) Are the simulated trends of
   mean and extreme temperature and precipitation over China consistent
   with observations? (2) What is the range of model uncertainty due to
   internal variability? The results show that CESM-LE can capture the
   trends of observed annul mean temperature and extremely low temperature
   days (ELD) over 16-26\% of China, but has difficulty in reproducing the
   observed trends in extremely high temperature days (EHD). For
   precipitation, CESM-LE demonstrates similar capability in reproducing
   the observed trends in annual mean precipitation and extreme
   precipitation days (EPD). For consecutive dry days (CDD), the decreasing
   trends over part of northwestern China can be captured, but the
   increasing trends over northern China cannot be reproduced by CESM-LE.
   Regarding the uncertainty of the model resulting from natural internal
   variability, because all 30 ensemble members of CESM use the same model
   and external forcing, CESM-LE's spread (uncertainty) is mainly due to
   internal variability. Larger uncertainty in simulated trends is found
   over northern China and the Tibetan Plateau for annual mean temperature,
   over northeastern China and the Huang-Huai region for ELD, and over the
   Tibetan Plateau for EHD. The trends in annual mean precipitation show
   uniform uncertainty over nearly all of China, except for the northwest.
   Larger uncertainty trends appear over southern and northwestern China
   for EPD, and over the Tibetan Plateau and northern China for CDD.},

Year = {2005},

Abstract = {Against the background of the fundamental importance of air temperature
   T-a and precipitation N as climate variables with significance to forest
   management, comparative trend analyses for T-a and N were carried out
   for two collectives of climate stations of the German Weather Service in
   Baden-Wuerttemberg (south-west Germany). The first collective consists
   of 14 stations representing different forest growth areas. The second
   collective forms a nesting within the first collective, as it covers 17
   stations in the south-western part of the Swabian Jura. The trend
   analyses are based on daily values of T-a and N, which refer to the
   period 1950 to 2000 for the first collective and to the climate standard
   period 1961 to 1990 for the second collective.
   The results show an average increase of the mean annual T-a values by
   0.22 degrees C/decade. The trends for the T-a means in the winter and
   summer half year were also positive with a higher trend amount in the
   winter half year. Therefore, the annual heat sum increased on average,
   while the annual cold sum decreased. The annual precipitation exhibited
   also an average increase (first collective: 25.1 mm/decade; second
   collective: 9.1 mm/decade). The positive trend amount, however, was
   still more pronounced for N of the winter half year. For the first
   collective, the trends of N of the summer half year were characterized
   by a station-to-station variability resulting in a slightly negative
   trend on average (-2.2 mm/decade). All stations of the second collective
   had a negative trend for N of the summer half year. Therefore, the
   average N trend was more pronounced (-16.6 mm/decade) than for the first
   collective. The average T-a and N trends showed the tendency of a
   dependence on the station elevation. The trends of the single stations,
   however, scattered broadly around the linear regression lines.
   Altogether, the resulted trends displayed a certain station-to station
   variability, which was mainly caused by the different structure of the
   investigation areas and variable climate conditions within the two
   investigation periods. Hence, the question arises how suited are the
   results of retrospective analyses of climate data for the climate
   adjusted silviculture.},

Abstract = {Precipitation and temperature are the two important factors which have
   more influence and role in climate change as well as hydrology cycle;
   therefore in this research, the fluctuating trends of rainfall and
   temperature of the Kabul River basin, Afghanistan, at eight different
   stations are analyzed. The annual and monthly data were used to detect
   the trends of precipitation, whereas for temperature trend the maximum
   and minimum annual data were used. Precipitation data from 2000 to 2018
   for eight different metrological stations of the Kabul River basin were
   analyzed to find the changes in rainfall trend, while for temperature
   data from the five available weather stations for a period from 2008 to
   2018 were used. Temporal precipitation and temperature variation were
   calculated on monthly and annual intervals. Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope
   method was used for the trend analysis, which supports nonparametric
   statistical analysis. The trend of annual precipitation was calculated
   over 18 years for all stations. After trend analysis of precipitation
   with Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope, the result showed the increasing
   precipitation trend of 4.88-30.42 mm/year, as well as the minimum
   temperatures have increased significantly at a different rate of (-0.02)
   to (0.71) degrees C/year. The outcome of the present study may be useful

Title = {Assessment of changing trends of daily precipitation and temperature
   extremes in Bamako and Segou in Mali from 1961-2014},

Abstract = {In Mali the annual rainfall is highly variable, ranging from less than
   200 mm-1 300 mm and its distribution is unevenly spread between north
   and south. Climate change threatens to increase air temperatures and
   evapotranspiration, increase the risk of intense rainstorms, and
   increase the risk of heat waves associated with drought. The objective
   of this study is to assess the change trends of daily temperature and
   precipitation extremes in Bamako and Segou in Mali during the period
   between 1961 and - 2014. Analyses of the changes in trends of daily
   temperature and precipitation extremes in two regions were studied by
   calculated extreme climate extreme indices series in RClimdex software.
   Trends in extreme indices were studied for 5 temperature and 4
   precipitation series. Results showed a positive significant decrease of
   warming trends in cool days, cool nights, whereas warm extreme nights,
   day times and warm spells on the contrary showed positive significant
   increasing warming throughout the Segou region. In Bamako, temperature
   extreme showed an insignificant trend for negative extremes decreasing
   warming trends for cold nights and cold days while warm nights, warm
   days and warm spells showed insignificant positive trends over the
   period from 1961 to 2014. The results of precipitation extremes for
   Segou showed positive significant decrease in consecutive wet day and in
   extremely wet, whereas Maximum 5 day's precipitation showed positive
   insignificant increase and the total annual precipitation showed a
   positive insignificant decrease. In Bamako consecutive wet day, Maximum
   5 day's precipitation and total annual precipitation showed positive
   insignificant decrease. Despite the small number of homogenous
   temperature and rainfall indices series, the study could present a
   proportion of significant extremes in Segou station averages trends. The
   study provided evidence that during the last 53 years; Segou was
   particularly affected by warm extremes based on night time indices
   rather than cold extremes based on day time indices.},

Title = {Flipping of temperature and precipitation trends over the Indian
   subcontinent due to diametrically opposing influence of GHGs and
   aerosols},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {Despite significant development in the Earth system models (ESMs) and
   releases of several coupled model intercomparison projects (CMIPs), the
   evolving patterns of Indian summer monsoon rainfall and its future
   trajectory is still uncertain, with low confidence in its direction.
   This could be because of differential impacts from increasing greenhouse
   gas (GHG) and aerosol concentrations. We found that the observed
   pre-2000 (1951-2000) declining monsoon was likely attributed to the
   increasing aerosol concentrations. On the contrary, the reported revival
   of post-2000 monsoon rainfall is due to GHG dominance. These are
   spatiotemporally consistent with individual CMIP Phase 6 (CMIP6) ESM
   simulations with GHG and aerosols separately. Similar results were
   obtained for temperature in India, which showed no to low warming signal
   in pre-2000 due to aerosol-driven cooling. The dominance of GHG impacts
   has increased India's warming trend in post-2000. This research
   highlights a notable trend in temperature and precipitation across the
   Indian subcontinent during the past two decades, emphasizing the dynamic
   character of climate change explained by contrasting anthropogenic
   influences, including GHGs and aerosols.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to investigates the precipitation and temperature
   trends over ten districts of Jimma zone in the twenty-first century
   using observed and model simulation data sets. The precipitation and
   temperature trends are analyzed for the reference (1981-2010) and two
   future periods, namely, mid-century (2031-2060), and end-century
   (2071-2100) using Innovative Trend Analysis. For future period, we
   analyzed the ensemble mean of precipitation and temperature based on
   data from four high resolution models, namely, High-Resolution Hamburg
   Climate Model 5, Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO22T), Climate
   Limited-Area Modeling Community (CCLM4), and the Rossby Centre Regional
   Atmospheric Model (RCA4). Based on the analysis, the annual, summer and
   autumn rainfall trend during the reference period are - 4.079 mm/year,
   2.147 mm/year, and - 1.639 mm/year, respectively. The winter rainfall
   reveals a negative trend (- 0.135 mm/year) during the reference period.
   However, the winter rainfall shows a positive trend (0.465 mm/year and
   0.067 mm/year) towards the end-century period under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5
   scenarios. On the contrary, the autumn rainfall showed consistent
   decreasing trend during the two future periods. The maximum increasing
   trend (1.376 mm/year) in annual rainfall was obtained during the
   mid-century period under RCP4.5 scenario, whereas the maximum annual
   decreasing rainfall trend was obtained during the mid-century period
   under RCP8.5 scenario (- 0.649 mm/year). The minimum temperature showed
   significant increasing trend throughout the study periods. However, the
   maximum temperature showed decreasing trend during annual and winter in
   the mid-century period under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The highest
   increasing trend of the minimum temperature was during winter and
   autumn, while the highest increasing trend of the maximum temperature
   was during the summer and autumn seasons. The result further indicate
   that the minimum temperature increment was faster as compared to the
   maximum temperature. The study can be used as a first-hand information
   to develop efficient adaptation policies and mitigation measures that
   aids to combat the adverse impact of climate change.},

   GLOBAL AND REGIONAL TREND PATTERNS OF PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE},
Journal = {ERDKUNDE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {A main task of climate research is to provide estimates about future
   climate change under global warming conditions. The main tools for this
   are dynamic climate models. However, different models vary
   quantitatively - and in some aspects even qualitatively - in the climate
   change signals they produce. In this study, this uncertainty about
   future climate is tackled by the evaluation of climate models in a
   standardized setup of multiple regions and variables based on four
   sophisticated metrics. Weighting models based on their performance will
   help to increase the confidence in climate model projections. Global and
   regional climate models are evaluated for 50-year trends of simulated
   seasonal precipitation and temperature. The results of these evaluations
   are compared, and their impact on probabilistic projections of
   precipitation and temperature when used as bases of weighting factors is
   analyzed. This study is performed on two spatial scales: seven globally
   distributed large study areas and eight sub-regions of the Mediterranean
   area. Altogether, over 62 global climate models with 159 transient
   simulations for precipitation and 119 for temperature from four
   emissions scenarios are evaluated against the ERA-20C reanalysis. The
   results indicate large agreement between three out of four metrics. The
   fourth one addresses a new climate model characteristic that shows no
   correlation to any other ranking. Overall, especially temperature shows
   a high agreement to the reference data set while precipitation offers
   better potential for weighting. Because of the differences being rather
   small, the metrics are better suited for performance rankings than as
   weighting factors. Finally, there is conformity with previous model
   evaluation studies: both the model performance and the implications of
   weighting for probabilistic climate projections strictly depend on the
   selected region, season and variable. Thus, none of the climate models
   generally outperforms all others.},

Abstract = {Strangles is a highly contagious upper respiratory infection of equids
   that is globally distributed. The causative agent of strangles,
   Streptococcus equi subspecies equi, can be spread through indirect
   contact with infected fomites, and studies have shown this microbe to
   live well in varying environmental conditions. The purpose of this study
   was to analyze strangles case numbers across the United States of
   America from 2018 to 2022 to investigate potential temporal or weather
   patterns associated with outbreaks. Diagnosed case records were obtained
   from the Equine Disease Communication Center, university databases,
   government agencies, or veterinary diagnostic labs, and geographic
   information systems (GISs) were used to map cases and to acquire
   relevant meteorological data from outbreak areas. These data were
   analyzed using logistic regression to explore trends that occur between
   outbreaks and changes in temperature and precipitation. Initial review
   of weather data suggested monthly changes in strangles case numbers
   corresponded with changing seasons. Logistic regression indicated that
   changes in monthly average temperature and minimum temperature were
   significantly associated with increased or decreased odds of strangles
   outbreaks, respectively. Future analyses should focus on weather data
   isolated within a smaller region or state to better resolve trends in
   strangles outbreaks throughout the continental USA.},

Abstract = {This study aims to examine how future climate, temperature and
   precipitation specifically, are expected to change under the A2, A1B,
   and B1 emission scenarios over the six states that make up the Southern
   Climate Impacts Planning Program (SCIPP): Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas,
   Louisiana, Tennessee, and Mississippi. SCIPP is a member of the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-funded Regional Integrated
   Sciences and Assessments network, a program which aims to better connect
   climate-related scientific research with in-the-field decision-making
   processes. The results of the study found that the average temperature
   over the study area is anticipated to increase by 1.7A degrees C to 2.4A
   degrees C in the twenty-first century based on the different emission
   scenarios with a rate of change that is more pronounced during the
   second half of the century. Summer and fall seasons are projected to
   have more significant temperature increases, while the northwestern
   portions of the region are projected to experience more significant
   increases than the Gulf coast region. Precipitation projections,
   conversely, do not exhibit a discernible upward or downward trend. Late
   twenty-first century exhibits slightly more precipitation than the early
   century, based on the A1B and B1 scenario, and fall and winter are
   projected to become wetter than the late twentieth century as a whole.
   Climate changes on the city level show that greater warming will
   happened in inland cities such as Oklahoma City and El Paso, and heavier
   precipitation in Nashville. These changes have profound implications for
   local water resources management as well as broader regional decision
   making. These results represent an initial phase of a broader study that
   is being undertaken to assist SCIPP regional and local water planning
   efforts in an effort to more closely link climate modeling to
   longer-term water resources management and to continue assessing climate
   change impacts on regional hazards management in the South.},

Abstract = {Many studies have reported the excellent ability of high-resolution
   satellite precipitation products (0.25 degrees or finer) to capture the
   spatial distribution of precipitation. However, it is not known whether
   the precipitation trends derived from them are reliable. For the first
   time, we have evaluated the annual and seasonal precipitation trends
   from two typical sources of high-resolution satellite-gauge products,
   TRMM 3B43 and PERSIANN-CDR, using rain gauge observations over China,
   and they were also compared with those from gauge-only products (0.25
   degrees and 0.5 degrees precipitation products, hereafter called CN25
   and CN50). The evaluation focused mainly on the magnitude, significance,
   sign, and relative order of the precipitation trends, and was conducted
   at gridded and regional scales. The following results were obtained: (1)
   at the gridded scale, neither satellite-gauge products precisely measure
   the magnitude of precipitation trends but they do reproduce their sign
   and relative order; regarding capturing the significance of trends, they
   exhibit relatively acceptable performance only over regions with a
   sufficient amount of significant precipitation trends; (2) at the
   regional scale, both satellite-gauge products generally provide reliable
   precipitation trends, although they do not reproduce the magnitude of
   trends in winter precipitation; and (3) overall, CN50 and TRMM 3B43
   outperform others in reproducing all four aspects of the precipitation
   trends. Compared with CN25, PERSIANN-CDR performs better in determining
   the magnitude of precipitation trends but marginally worse in
   reproducing their sign and relative order; moreover, both of them are at
   a level in capturing the significance of precipitation trends.},

Abstract = {This research presents an alternative method for scandium (Sc) recovery
   from impure bauxite residue solutions containing Fe(III), Al, Ca, Nd,

   solution, while co-precipitation of other elements in the synthetic
   pregnant leach solution remained negligible. When using dibasic
   phosphate as the precipitant, in the pH range of 1.5-2.5, both Sc and Fe
   were removed rapidly, while co-precipitation of other ions remained low.
   Experimental results were used to propose the preliminary design of a
   three-stage precipitation process capable of producing a scandium

Title = {Daily precipitation and temperature for 2021-2050 over China: Multiple

Abstract = {Daily climate data are extremely important to drive ecological models,
   but the outputs of climate models are often deviated from the
   observations. The bias correction methods mostly highlight the target
   statistical parameters (e.g., mean and variance) for a target period,
   but perturb the simulated change trend and variability. In this study,
   we utilize a trend-preserving bias correc-tion method that can
   simultaneously consider the frequency and intensity of climatic
   variables to adjust the daily maximum and minimum temperature, and
   precipitation (Tmax, Tmin, and Pre) from CORDEX-EA regional climate
   models for the period of 2021-2050 over China. Results show that: (a)
   the bias correction method greatly improves the spatial patterns of
   simulated Tmax, Tmin, and Pre since the corrected data has higher
   correlation and smaller dif-ferences across the whole domain. The
   differences in mean Tmax, Tmin, and Pre between climate models and
   observations have been reduced from -4.5 +/- 6.41 degrees C, -2.06 +/-
   0.58 degrees C, 177.25 +/- 51.55 mm before correction to 0.01 +/- 0.02
   degrees C, -0.01 +/- 0.02 degrees C, -26.22 +/- 6.39 mm after
   correction, respec-tively. In addition, the simulated change trend and
   climate variability at all time scales are well preserved. (b)
   Spatially, the warming rates in the west would be higher than in the
   east, and they are larger under the most severe future emissions
   scenario (RCP8.5) relative to the low-mid emissions scenario (RCP4.5).
   The Pre change would mainly occur over east China with the signifi-cant
   upward trend. The dataset presented in this article has been published

Abstract = {Urbanization plays an important role in altering local to regional
   climate. In this study, the trends in precipitation and the air
   temperature were investigated for urban and peri-urban areas of 18 mega
   cities selected from six continents (representing a wide range of
   climatic patterns). Multiple statistical tests were used to examine
   long-term trends in annual and seasonal precipitation and air
   temperature for the selected cities. The urban and peri-urban areas were
   classified based on the percentage of land imperviousness. Through this
   study, it was evident that removal of the lag-k serial correlation
   caused a reduction of approximately 20 to 30\% in significant trend
   observability for temperature and precipitation data. This observation
   suggests that appropriate trend analysis methodology for climate studies
   is necessary. Additionally, about 70\% of the urban areas showed higher
   positive air temperature trends, compared with peri-urban areas. There
   were not clear trend signatures (i.e., mix of increase or decrease) when
   comparing urban vs peri-urban precipitation in each selected city.
   Overall, cities located in dry areas, for example, in Africa, southern
   parts of North America, and Eastern Asia, showed a decrease in annual
   and seasonal precipitation, while wetter conditions were favorable for
   cities located in wet regions such as, southeastern South America,
   eastern North America, and northern Europe. A positive relationship was
   observed between decadal trends of annual/seasonal air temperature and
   precipitation for all urban and peri-urban areas, with a higher rate
   being observed for urban areas.},

Title = {Recent summer precipitation trends in the Greater Horn of Africa and the

Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},

Abstract = {We utilize a variety of climate datasets to examine impacts of two
   mechanisms on precipitation in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) during
   northern-hemisphere summer. First, surface-pressure gradients draw moist
   air toward the GHA from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Congo Basin.
   Variability of the strength of these gradients strongly influences GHA
   precipitation totals and accounts for important phenomena such as the
   1960s-1980s rainfall decline and devastating 1984 drought. Following the
   1980s, precipitation variability became increasingly influenced by the
   southern tropical Indian Ocean (STIO) region. Within this region,
   increases in sea-surface temperature, evaporation, and precipitation are
   linked with increased exports of dry mid-tropospheric air from the STIO
   region toward the GHA. Convergence of dry air above the GHA reduces
   local convection and precipitation. It also produces a clockwise
   circulation response near the ground that reduces moisture transports
   from the Congo Basin. Because precipitation originating in the Congo
   Basin has a unique isotopic signature, records of moisture transports
   from the Congo Basin may be preserved in the isotopic composition of
   annual tree rings in the Ethiopian Highlands. A negative trend in
   tree-ring oxygen-18 during the past half century suggests a decline in
   the proportion of precipitation originating from the Congo Basin. This
   trend may not be part of a natural cycle that will soon rebound because
   climate models characterize Indian Ocean warming as a principal
   signature of greenhouse-gas induced climate change. We therefore expect
   surface warming in the STIO region to continue to negatively impact GHA
   precipitation during northern-hemisphere summer.},

Abstract = {Record-breaking precipitation events have been frequent in Japan in
   recent years. To investigate the statistical characteristics of the
   frequency of record-breaking events, observations can be compared with
   the values derived from sampling theory with a stationary state. This
   study counted the number of record-breaking daily and 3-day total
   precipitation events at 58 rain-gauge stations in Japan between 1901 and
   2018. The average number of record-breaking events over the 118-year
   period was 5.9 for daily total precipitation, which is larger than the
   theoretical value of 5.4 derived using the assumption that the climate
   system over the same period was stationary. Sampling theory was used to
   incorporate the influence of the long-term temperature trend from the
   Clausius-Clapeyron relation associated with the saturation vapor
   pressure. In theory, the long-term temperature trend gives a similar
   number of observed record-breaking events when the long-term temperature
   trend is approximately 0.5 Kelvin/100 years.},

Title = {Changes in extreme temperature and precipitation in the Arab region:
   long-term trends and variability related to ENSO and NAO},

Abstract = {A workshop was held in Casablanca, Morocco, in March 2012, to enhance
   knowledge of climate extremes and their changes in the Arab region. This
   workshop initiated intensive data compilation activities of daily
   observational weather station data from the Arab region. After
   conducting careful control processes to ensure the quality and
   homogeneity of the data, climate indices for extreme temperatures and
   precipitation were calculated.This study examines the temporal changes
   in climate extremes in the Arab region with regard to long-term trends
   and natural variability related to ENSO and NAO. We find consistent
   warming trends since the middle of the 20th Century across the region.
   This is evident in the increased frequencies of warm days and warm
   nights, higher extreme temperature values, fewer cold days and cold
   nights and shorter cold spell durations. The warming trends seem to be
   particularly strong since the early 1970s. Changes in precipitation are
   generally less consistent and characterised by a higher spatial and
   temporal variability; the trends are generally less significant.
   However, in the western part of the Arab region, there is a tendency
   towards wetter conditions. In contrast, in the eastern part, there are
   more drying trends, although, these are of low significance.We also find
   some relationships between climate extremes in the Arab region and
   certain prominent modes of variability, in particular El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The
   relationships of the climate extremes with NAO are stronger, in general,
   than those with ENSO, and are particularly strong in the western part of
   the Arab region (closer to the Atlantic Ocean). The relationships with
   ENSO are found to be more significant towards the eastern part of the
   area of study. (c) 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

Journal = {WETLANDS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Temperature and precipitation changes play critical roles in permafrost
   thaw, wetland water storage, plant growth and greenhouse gas emissions.
   This study evaluates the spring (AMJ) and fall (SON) - shoulder season
   temperature and precipitation conditions for Polar Bear Pass (PBP), a
   Ramsar wetland site of international importance, to assess significant
   changes since the early 1980s when a weather station was deployed here
   on a polar desert upland adjacent to the wetland. Temperature and
   precipitation records are compared to the nearby government weather
   station at Resolute Bay (RB). Fall temperature conditions at PBP and RB
   show significant warming, though spring temperature conditions do not.
   The North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO) accounts for most of the
   variability in air temperature at the sites. Surface temperatures are
   increasing in the spring at PBP but cannot yet be linked to an earlier
   loss of snow cover. There is an earlier trend to snow on validating
   recent High Arctic space-based snow cover studies. The identified trends
   during the shoulder seasons highlight the importance of year-round
   monitoring and the need for improved data collection techniques in
   important ecological environments such as High Arctic wetlands.},

Abstract = {Hydrological features on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, include
   groundwater, freshwater lakes, permanent and seasonal ponds, streams,
   and estuaries. Rainfall and evaporation/evapotranspiration have long
   been considered the dominant factors influencing both lake and
   groundwater levels in this sole-source, unconfined aquifer. However,
   increases in sea level may also have an effect, especially on this
   narrow peninsula with a sandy substrate of high permeability. In this
   study, we analyzed trends between 2000 and 2017 in eleven groundwater
   wells and nine kettle ponds situated with Cape Cod National Seashore
   (CCNS). We further explored relationships of these hydrologic variables
   with local precipitation, temperature and sea level during this period.
   The results suggest that while precipitation patterns influence seasonal
   and inter-annual variability, it appears that sea level rise (SLR) may
   be partially responsible for driving the longer-term trend of rising
   groundwater levels in several wells. Pond stages did not exhibit any
   statistically significant trends, and responded more to precipitation
   during this period of time. Notwithstanding, further acceleration of
   SLR, along with potential changes in precipitation patterns, can alter
   the freshwater hydrology of CCNS that may subsequently have biological,
   chemical, and physical effects throughout these systems.},

Abstract = {Extreme climate events often cause catastrophic damage to nature and
   human society. Therefore, regional assessments in various climates and
   geographic regions are needed for understanding the uncertainties of the
   change trends for extreme climate events. The objective of this study
   was to assess the spatial distribution and temporal trends of extreme
   precipitation and temperature events on the Loess Plateau of China
   during 1961-2007. Nine indicators (pq90, px5d, pint, pxcdd, pnl9, txq90,
   tnq10, tnfd, bchw90) were chosen to quantify extreme climate events, the
   Mann-Kendall method and linear trend analysis were used to test the
   change in trend and the magnitude, and inverse distance weighted
   interpolation was used to interpolate the spatial patterns. Results
   showed that most extreme climate indicators were spatially distributed
   with obvious gradients from the southeast to the northwest. Heavy
   rainfall threshold (pq90), greatest 5-day total rainfall (px5d), heavy
   rainfall days (pnl9) and cold-night threshold (tnq10) decreased from the
   southeast to the northwest, while simple daily rainfall intensity
   (pint), longest dry period (pxcdd) and number of frost days (tnfd)
   increased from the southeast to the northwest. Most stations had
   monotonic trends in extreme indicators during 1961-2007. However, the
   number of stations with significant trends varied greatly.
   Precipitation-based indicators showed more mixed patterns of change and
   few stations had significant trends. However, temperature-based
   indicators had more uniform changes and most stations had significant
   trends. Hot-day threshold (txq90) and cold-night threshold (tnq10), and
   the longest heatwave (txhw90) tended to increase while the number of
   frost days decreased since the 1960s on the Loess Plateau. Overall,
   extreme precipitation events did not change significantly; however,
   extreme temperature events became more severe and frequent. The results
   implied that extreme climate events on the Loess Plateau will continue
   to have adverse impacts, and adaptive measures should be considered for
   future ecological construction and agriculturally sustainable
   development. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {July mean temperature and annual precipipation during the last 9900 cal.
   yr BP were reconstructed from pollen assemblages preserved in a sediment
   core from northern Finland. Quantitative reconstructions were performed
   using a modern pollen-climate calibration model based on
   weighted-averaging partial least squares regression. The predictive
   ability of the model was evaluated against modern meteorological data
   using leave-one-out cross-validation. The prediction error for July mean
   temperature is c. 1.0 degreesC and for annual precipitation 340 mm. The
   July mean temperatures during the earliest Holocene were low, c. 11.0
   degreesC, and annual precipitation was high, c. 600-800 torn. Between
   8200 and 6700 cal. yr BP July mean temperatures reached their maxima,
   12.5-13.0 degreesC, which are c. 1.4-1.7 degreesC higher than at
   present. At the same time precipitation decreased. During the late
   Holocene, July mean temperatures declined and the last 2000 years have
   been the coolest since the early Holocene. Precipitation has slightly
   increased. The spatial coherence between our results and of several
   other climate reconstructions from northern Europe indicates that the
   Holocene climate was strongly influenced by North Atlantic oceanic and
   atmospheric circulation patterns. We propose that the distinctly oceanic
   climate of the early Holocene was due to enhanced westerly (latitudinal)
   airflow which was replaced at c. 8200 cal. yr BP by a more meridional
   flow pattern and by the development of predominantly anticyclonic summer
   conditions.},

Abstract = {In the framework of the IWAS/Agua-DF project, this study focuses on
   changes in mean surface air temperature and accumulated precipitation in
   Central Brazil over the past 40 years. It has two main objectives: (1)
   comparison between two climatological periods (2001-2010 and 1971-2000)
   and (2) trend analysis of climate variables. Time series of
   meteorological and rain gauge stations from Central Brazil have been
   organized in a databank, which contains tools for homogeneity tests.
   From that, 4 temperature and 55 precipitation time series were
   sufficient homogeneous, while 1 temperature and 5 precipitation time
   series were identified as inhomogeneous. Reliable spatial distribution
   was produced using proper interpolation method. Trends and significance
   levels were calculated by Rapp's estimator of slope and Mann-Kendall
   test, respectively. The most important results of the comparisons and
   trend analysis in the last four decades are: (1) marked increase in
   annual and seasonal mean surface air temperature, (2) evident decreases
   of accumulated rainfall in winter and autumn, and (3) apparent increase
   of precipitation amounts in the rainy season.},

Abstract = {The Highlands region, in Algeria, covers an area about 260,000 km(2)
   wide and it is populated by more than 10 million inhabitants, whose
   activities are overstressing the water resource. As a case study to test
   a workflow, based on solid proven methodologies, the Algerian highlands
   climatic assessment was performed by analyzing precipitation,
   temperature, and evapotranspiration data (from 1985 to 2014), then by
   computing the aridity index, the standardized precipitation index, and
   the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and by modeling the
   stochastic time series in order to predict climatic parameters using
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The
   seasonal-ARIMA (SARIMA) model performed better than the other models and
   returned significant p values for all the studied variables. An
   increasing trend in precipitation was detected for most of the study
   area, while no significant trend in temperature or evapotranspiration
   was usually detected. The trends were confirmed by the SARIMA forecasted
   model (2015-2024). Furthermore, the forecast model results were compared
   with the NDVI index for the periods of 2010-2014 and 2015-2020. This
   difference confirmed the results obtained in terms of precipitation
   trends for the forecast between 2015 and 2024 by an increase in the NDVI
   index in most of the study area. The proposed workflow could be reliable
   for water resource management and planning in order to help decision
   makers to face climate change.},

Title = {Projections of temperature and precipitation trends using CMhyd under
   CMIP6 scenarios: A case study of Iraq's Middle and West},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {306},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Climate change is becoming a leading issue in the 21st century due to
   its devastating environmental and socioeconomic impacts. It is believed
   to have significant impacts on the water resources and groundwater in
   the Middle East region, especially in Iraq. In this study, three
   different global climate models, under the 6th IPCC report, were
   downscaled under two SSPs scenarios in the middle and west of Iraq. The
   downscaled models were fixed for bias using CMhyd (climate model data
   for hydrologic modeling) over the study area. This was achieved using
   data from four locally chosen weather stations from 1983 to 2022. Three
   CMIP6 global models were considered and compared. These were the
   Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator version 1
   (ACCESS-CM2), the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model version 2
   (BCC-CSM2-MR), and the sixth version of the Model for Interdisciplinary
   Research on Climate (MIROC6).The findings of this study show that the
   temperature and precipitation changes in the three models under two
   scenarios in the future period (2023-2050) show an increasing trend
   compared to the observation period (1983-2014). The results of the
   generated predictions show that there will be an increase in annual
   maximum temperatures by this century's end, by 1.26-2.08 degrees C under
   scenario SSP2-4.5 and 1.57-2.34 degrees C under scenario SSP5-8.5 across
   all study stations. The study found that the annual increase in
   precipitation over the observed period varies between scenarios
   (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), ranging from +3.56 to +3.87\% for SSP2-4.5 and
   + 7.22\% to +12.61\% for SSP5-8.5. The results should help improve our
   understanding of the effects of climate change on the study region and
   encourage planners and stakeholders to identify optimal strategies for
   mitigating them.},

   Entropy},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the north Indian
   temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration (PET)
   change patterns were evaluated during the monsoon season across the last
   century. Trends and shifts in 146 districts were assessed using
   nonparametric statistical tests. To quantify their temporal variation,
   the concept of apportionment entropy was applied to both the annual and
   seasonal scales. Results suggest that the El Nino years played a greater
   role in causing hydro-climatological changes compared to the La Nina or
   neutral years. El Nino was more influential in causing shifts compared
   to trends. For certain districts, a phase change in ENSO reversed the
   trend/shift direction. The century-wide analysis suggested that the vast
   majority of the districts experienced significant decreasing
   trends/shifts in temperature and PET. However, precipitation experienced
   both increasing and decreasing trends/shifts based on the location of
   the districts. Entropy results suggested a lower apportionment of
   precipitation compared to the other variables, indicating an
   intermittent deviation of precipitation pattern from the generic trend.
   The findings may help understand the effects of ENSO on the
   hydro-climatological variables during the monsoon season. Practitioners
   may find the results useful as monsoon is the most important season for
   India causing climate extremes.},

Title = {Precipitation and Temperature Trends and Cycles Derived from Historical
   1890-2019 Weather Data for the City of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Patterns in historical climate data were analyzed for Ottawa, Ontario,
   Canada, for the interval 1890-2019. Variables analyzed included records
   of annual, seasonal, and extreme temperature and precipitation, diurnal
   temperature range, and various environmental responses. Using LOWESS
   regressions, it was found that annual and seasonal temperatures in
   Ottawa have generally increased through this interval, precipitation has
   shifted to a less snowy, rainier regime, and diurnal temperature
   variation has decreased. Furthermore, the annual growing season has
   lengthened by 23 days to similar to 163 days, and the annual number of
   frost-free days increased by 13 days to similar to 215 days. Despite
   these substantial climatic shifts, some variables (e.g., extreme weather
   events per year) have remained largely stable through the interval.
   Time-series analyses (including multitaper spectral analysis and
   continuous and cross wavelet transforms) have revealed the presence of
   several strong cyclical patterns in the instrumental record attributable
   to known natural climate phenomena. The strongest such influence on
   Ottawa's climate has been the 11-year solar cycle, while the influence
   of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic
   Oscillation, and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation were also observed and
   linked with the trends in annual, seasonal, and extreme weather. The
   results of this study, particularly the observed linkages between
   temperature and precipitation variables and cyclic climate drivers, will
   be of considerable use to policymakers for the planning, development,
   and maintenance of city infrastructure as Ottawa continues to rapidly
   grow under a warmer, wetter climate regime.},

Abstract = {Spatial variabilities and their relationships of the trends of
   temperature, water vapor, and precipitation in the North American
   Regional Reanalysis are examined for each season from March 1979 to
   February 2007. Results show that warming dominates the domain in the
   troposphere from the surface to 300 hPa. Water vapor increases at lower
   levels but does not change much at mid-upper levels. Because of the
   large increase of water vapor holding capacity of the air at all levels
   due to the warming, relative humidity has a decreasing trend at all
   levels. The decrease is small at the surface and largest at midlevels.
   Precipitation, which corresponds well to ascending motion in trends,
   both increases and decreases in about half of the domain. Statistical
   analysis from the very large spatial samples indicates that the
   precipitation trend positively relates to both specific humidity trend
   and relative humidity trend. However, temperature trend positively
   relates to specific humidity trend but negatively relates to relative
   humidity trend. So, in strong warming places, whether precipitation
   increases or not depends on whether the decrease of relative humidity
   becomes a limiting factor; small decrease of relative humidity may still
   allow precipitation to increase, but large decrease of relative humidity
   may make precipitation decrease. The uncertain relationship between the
   trends of precipitation and temperature can also be understood from the
   nonlinear characteristics of the atmospheric processes.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis benefits collecting and analyzing reliable data in
   climate change studies. In this context, long-term temperature and
   precipitation data analysis, two variables sensitive to climate change,
   is essential. This study aims to holistically and partially determine
   the annual trends of precipitation and temperature time series for
   1970-2019 at nine selected stations in the Susurluk Basin, Turkey. The
   innovative trend significance test (ITST), innovative crossing trend
   analysis (ICTA) method, and Mann-Kendall (MK) test were used to
   determine holistic trends. Also, partial trends were determined using
   successive average methodology (SAM). For the precipitation variable,
   while an increasing trend was determined for the ITST, there was mostly
   no trend for the other methods. While a strong increasing trend was
   detected for the temperature according to the ITST and MK methods, no
   trend was observed in any station according to the ICTA method.
   According to the SAM results, the maximum trend durations for the peak
   and trough change points were 4.9 (10.3) and 5.3 (8.4) years,
   respectively, for precipitation (temperature). The strong temperature
   trends in the basin will likely continue, requiring precautions against
   extreme events such as drought.},

Abstract = {The internal relationship between summer temperature (ST), annual
   precipitation (AP), annual mass balance (AM) and annual runoff (AR) of
   Glacier No. 1 from 1959 to 2006, a so- called ` summer accumulation
   type' glacier, was examined with several statistical methods including
   simple linear regression, the Mann- Kendall test and wavelet analysis.
   In total, ST, AP and AR increase with a rate of 0.02 degrees W/year,
   1.53 mm/year and 2.83 x 10(4) m(3)/year, respectively, while AM
   decreases at a rate of -14.5 mm/year. A step change of ST, AP, AM and AR
   was identified to have occurred in the mid- 1990s. After that, ST and AR
   increase significantly. Meanwhile, the period of coherence changes
   from4- 8 years to 2- 4 years, implying that when temperature increases
   greatly, the period tends to be shorter due to the fast response of the
   glacier. The increase of AR is caused by the loss of AM. The rise of ST
   is found to be responsible for the loss of AM, although the rise of AP
   is beneficial to the glacier accumulation. Our results on the dominant
   effect of temperature (rather than precipitation) on runoff of Glacier
   No. 1 could be used as the input to models in hydrology, geomorphology,
   climatology and paleoclimatology.},

Title = {Observed Trends and Variability of Temperature and Precipitation and

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Having an extreme topography and heterogeneous climate, the Upper Indus
   Basin (UIB) is more likely to be affected by climate change and it is a
   crucial area for climatological studies. Based on the monthly minimum
   temperature (T-min), maximum temperature (T-max) and precipitation from
   nine meteorological stations, the spatiotemporal variability of
   temperature and precipitation were analyzed on monthly, seasonal, and
   annual scales. Results show a widespread significant increasing trend of
   0.14 degrees C/decade for T-max, but a significant decreasing trend of
   -0.08 degrees C/decade for T-min annually, during 1955-2016 for the UIB.
   Seasonally, warming in T-max is stronger in winter and spring, while the
   cooling in T-min is greater in summer and autumn. Results of seasonal
   T-max indicate increasing trends in winter, spring and autumn at rates
   of 0.38, 0.35 and 0.05 degrees C/decade, respectively, while decreasing
   in summer with -0.14 degrees C/decade. Moreover, seasonal T-min results
   indicate increasing trends in winter and spring at rates of 0.09 and
   0.08 degrees C/decade, respectively, while decreasing significantly in
   summer and autumn at rates of -0.21 and -0.22 degrees C/decade
   respectively for the whole the UIB. Precipitation exhibits an increasing
   trend of 2.74 mm/decade annually, while, increasing in winter, summer
   and autumn at rates of 1.18, 2.06 and 0.62 mm/decade respectively. The
   warming in T-max and an increase in precipitation have been more
   distinct since the mid-1990s, while the cooling in T-min is observed in
   the UIB since the mid-1980s. Warming in the middle and higher altitude
   (1500-2800 m and >2800 m) are much stronger, and the increase is more
   obvious in regions with elevation >2800 m. The wavelet analysis
   illustrated sporadic inter-annual covariance of seasonal T-max, T-min
   and precipitation with ENSO, NAO, IOD and PDO in the UIB. The
   periodicities were usually constant over short timescales and
   discontinuous over longer timescales. This study offers a better
   understanding of the local climate characteristics and provides a
   scientific basis for government policymakers.},

Abstract = {A key challenge for climate projection science is to serve the growing
   needs of impact assessments in an environment with substantial
   differences in the projections of climate models and an increasing
   number of relevant climate model results. In order to assist the
   assessment of water resources impacts under future climate change, this
   work provides a synthesis of the simulations of General Circulation
   Models (GCMs) for the region of Distrito Federal, Brazil. The work
   analyzes projections of mean surface air temperature and precipitation
   of 22 GCMs, as well as seven extreme indices of 10 GCMs. Trends of the
   multi-model ensemble median, as well as their significance, were
   calculated. The consistency in the sign of change was assessed through
   the percentage of agreement of simulations with the median. Finally, the
   probability density function of the multi-model ensemble provides
   valuable information about the uncertainties of projections.
   Investigations were performed for annual and seasonal temporal scales
   for the period 2011-2050. The main results here identified are: (a) a
   consensus of the multi-model ensemble and median to increasing
   temperature; (b) a slightly, but less consistent, decrease of
   precipitation in the dry season; and (c) increase of heat waves and
   droughts events, although changes in precipitation extremes are much
   less coherent than for temperature. The approach used gives a
   comprehensive assessment of the possible future climate until the middle
   of the twenty-first century, as well as the uncertainties involved in
   the multi-model ensemble projections.},

Abstract = {Trends in air temperature and precipitation data are investigated for
   linkages to global warming and climate change. After checking for serial
   correlation with trend-free pre-whitening procedure, the Mann-Kendall
   test is used to detect monotonic trends and the Mann-Whitney test is
   used for trend step change. The case study is Maharlo watershed,
   Southwestern Iran, representing a semi-arid environment. Data are for
   the 1951-2011 period, from four temperature sites and seven
   precipitation sites. A homogeneity test investigates regional similarity
   of the time series data. The results include mean annual, mean annual
   maximum and minimum and seasonal analysis of air temperature and
   precipitation data. Mean annual temperature results indicate an
   increasing trend, while a non-significant trend in precipitation is
   observed in all the stations. Furthermore, significant phase change was
   detected in mean annual air temperature trend of Shiraz station in 1977,
   indicating decreasing trend during 1951-1976 and increasing trend during
   1977-2011. The annual precipitation analysis for Shiraz shows a
   non-significant decrease during 1951-1976 and 1977-2011. The result of
   homogeneity test reveals that the studied stations form one homogeneous
   region. While air temperature trends appear as regional linkage to

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal changes in total precipitation as well as the magnitude
   and frequency of extreme precipitation events in Iran are assessed using
   187 gauging stations with at least 41 years of records until 2009. The
   spatial distribution of extreme precipitation is evaluated based on the
   generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution fitted to the
   annual/seasonal maximum daily series at each location. Temporal trends
   of the magnitude of extreme precipitation events are also analysed using
   the annual/seasonal maximum daily series, while temporal trends of the
   frequency of extremes are assessed based on records exceeding the 99th
   percentile threshold. Results show an overall declining trend of the
   annual precipitation in particular in regions located on the north, west
   and northwest of Iran. Seasonal analysis shows the largest contribution
   of winter to this declining trend. In addition, precipitation has
   significantly decreased in the northwest during spring. Although the
   changes in the magnitudes of extreme precipitation events are
   insignificant, with increasing trends in 50\% of the stations, the
   overall frequencies show significant declines in particular during
   winter. The magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation have also
   significantly declined in the northwest region during spring.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the spatial and temporal variability of selected
   extreme precipitation indices in Northern Portugal. Data were collected
   in the period of 1950-2000 from 39 meteorological and gauge stations.
   Tests of homogeneity (e.g., Pettit, SNHT, Buishand and Von Neumann
   tests) were performed for all the data collected from the gauge series,
   in order to identify and select the useful series to time variability
   analysis. Four extreme precipitation indices were investigated: total
   precipitation in wet days, with daily precipitation >= 1 mm (PRCPTOT);
   number of days with precipitation amount >= 30 mm (R30mm); the maximum 5
   day precipitation amount (Rx5day); and total precipitation amount >=
   95th percentile (R95p). The Mann-Kendall non-parametric test was applied
   to detect long term (1950-2000) trends in the aforementioned indices of
   extremes. Annual and seasonal trends were analyzed in this study. The
   results showed a decrease in extreme precipitation indices during annual
   scale, spring, winter and summer but showed a slight increase during
   autumn. For most series, there is no statistically significant trend in
   the parameters of extreme precipitation analyzed. Out of all of the
   indices examined, only three rain-gauges showed significant trends on
   annual scale. On a seasonal timescale, extreme precipitation indices
   tended to decrease in winter, spring and summer in more than 80\% of the
   precipitation series. The opposite was observed in autumn in which the
   four indices studied showed that more than 70\% of the series had a
   positive trend. However, only 15\% of the series showed a significant
   trend in winter, 46\% in spring, only 2\% in summer and 4\% in autumn.

Abstract = {Annual rainfall series trends were investigated for more than 100 years
   of data using two non-parametric trend tests Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's
   slope (Q) for five selected meteorological stations in Victoria,
   Australia. The annual rainfall time series showed no significant trends
   for any of the five stations. To assess the sensitivity of trends to the
   length of the time periods considered, the annual rainfall analysis was
   repeated using recent data from approximately half the data set between
   1949 and 2011. Contrasting results from the original full data set
   analysis were revealed. All five stations showed decreasing trends with
   two stations showing significant trends suggesting that this recent time
   period has added more low precipitation data to the time series. The
   year of abrupt changes for all the five stations identified using the
   sequential MK test varied. Conclusions drawn from this paper, point to
   the importance of selecting the time series data length in identifying
   trends and abrupt changes. Due to the climate variability, trend testing
   results might be biased and strongly dependent on the data period
   selected. Therefore, use of the full data set available would be
   required in order to improve understanding of change or to undertake any
   further studies.},

Abstract = {In recent years, gridded precipitation products have been widely used in
   hydrology studies and other fields of water sciences. This study
   evaluated the potential of several gridded precipitation products,
   including GPCC, TRMM, CRU, ERA-Interim, and ERA5, in trend analysis of
   precipitation depth and the number of rainy days in various regions of
   Iran. Moreover, the observational precipitation data of the daily time
   series were collected from 68 Iranian synoptic stations. The
   Mann-Kendall test was conducted to determine gridded and observed
   precipitation trends in the period of 1997 to 2017. The probability of
   detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR) indices were utilized to
   compare gridded and observed precipitation trends. Results showed that
   the best consistency (POD: 52\% similar to 80\%, FAR: 60\% similar to
   88\%) was observed between the observed trends of the number of rainy
   days and those obtained by TRMM product over different regions of Iran.
   Moreover, ERA-Interim offered a better performance (POD: 50\% similar to
   100\%, FAR: 58\% similar to 72\%) in the trend analysis of precipitation
   depth in Iran. The consistency between observational and gridded
   precipitation trends has never been analyzed in Iran at this level;
   therefore, this is considered a unique analysis. Besides, the generated
   maps of precipitation products' performance provide a comprehensive view
   of better water resources management over different regions of Iran.},

Title = {Trends in Canadian precipitation intensity},

Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {321-347},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Past research has unveiled important variations in total precipitation,
   often related to large-scale shifts in atmospheric circulation, and
   consistent with projected responses to enhanced greenhouse warming. Move
   recently, however it has been realized that important and influential
   changes in rha variability of daily precipitation events have also
   occurred in the past, often unrelated to changes in total accumulation.
   This study aims to uncover variations in daily precipitation intensity
   over Canada and to compare the observed variations with those in total
   accumulation and two dominant modes of atmospheric variability namely
   the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pactfic/North America
   teleconnection pattern (PNA). Results are examined on both annual and
   seasonal bases, and with regions defined by similarities in monthly
   variability
   Seasonally increasing trends in total precipitation that result from
   increases in all levels of evens intensity during the 20(th) century are
   found in southern areas of Canada. During the after half of the century
   increases ale concentrated in heavy and intermediate events, with the
   largest changes occuring in Arctic areas. Variations in precipitation
   intensity can, however be unrelated to variations in the total
   accumulation. Consistent with these differences, the precipitation
   responses lo the NAO and PNA are often found to occur only at specific
   levels of event intensity! Precipitation responses to the NAO occur in
   northeastern regions in summer and winter with the intensity affected in
   Both seasons. The PNA strongly influences precipitation in many regions
   of the the country during autumn and winter. In particular, it strongly
   influences variations in southern British Columbia and the Prairies,
   affecting the intensity in only some areas. However, it only influences
   the frequency of heavier events in autumn and winter in Ontario and
   southern Quebec, where this response is actually more robust than the
   response in total accumulation. During these seasons a negative PNA
   generally leads to more extreme precipitation events.},

Abstract = {Jharkhand is one of the eastern states of India which has an
   agriculture-based economy. Uncertain and erratic distribution of
   precipitation as well as a lack of state water resources planning is the
   major limitation to crop growth in the region. In this study, the
   spatial and temporal variability in precipitation in the state was
   examined using a monthly precipitation time series of 111 years
   (1901-2011) from 18 meteorological stations. Autocorrelation and
   Mann-Kendall/modified Mann-Kendall tests were utilized to detect
   possible trends, and the Theil and Sen slope estimator test was used to
   determine the magnitude of change over the entire time series. The most
   probable change year (change point) was detected using the
   Pettitt-Mann-Whitney test, and the entire time series was sub-divided
   into two parts: before and after the change point. Arc-Map 9.3 software
   was utilized to assess the spatial patterns of the trends over the
   entire state. Annual precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend in 5 out
   of 18 stations during the whole period. For annual, monsoon and winter
   periods of precipitation, the slope test indicated a decreasing trend
   for all stations during 1901-2011. The highest variability was observed
   in post-monsoon precipitation (77.87 \%) and the lowest variability was
   observed in the annual series (15.76 \%) over the 111 years. An
   increasing trend in precipitation in the state was found during the
   period 1901-1949, which was reversed during the subsequent period
   (1950-2011).},

Abstract = {In this study, the major winter wheat planting area of China is selected
   as the study area, with the time scale of the growth period of winter
   wheat (a total of 56 growth periods during October 1961 to May 2016).
   The significance, stability, magnitude of the trend and the average
   trend of the study area with eight temperature indices and seven
   precipitation indices of 453 meteorological stations are tested by
   Mann-Kendall method and Sen's nonparametric method. The following
   observation can be made: (1) the cold extreme indices show strong and
   stable downward trend in most of the stations in the study area, while
   the hot extreme indices show a strong and stable upward trend,
   especially in the northern winter wheat planting area and the north of
   the southern winter wheat planting area. (2) The trends of extreme
   precipitation indices in most of the sites in the study area are
   insignificant and unstable. Only in R20mm, a significant and stable
   decreasing trend is shown in some stations, which is mainly located in
   the northern winter wheat planting area and part of the central and
   western regions in the study area. The results in some ways could enrich
   the references for understanding the climate change in the growth period
   of winter wheat in the region and help to formulate a better agronomic
   management practice of winter wheat.},

Abstract = {Observations show an increase in maximum precipitation extremes and a
   decrease in maximum temperature extremes over southeastern South America
   (SESA) in the second half of the twentieth century. The Community Earth
   System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble (LE) experiments are able to
   successfully reproduce the observed trends of extreme precipitation and
   temperature over SESA. Careful analysis of a smaller ensemble of CESM-LE
   single forcing experiments reveals that the trends of extreme
   precipitation and temperature over SESA are mostly caused by
   stratospheric ozone depletion. The underlying dynamical mechanism is
   investigated and it is found that, as a consequence of stratospheric
   ozone depletion and the resulting southward shift of tropospheric jet
   streams, anomalous easterly flow and more intense cyclones have occurred
   over SESA, which are favorable for heavier rainfall extremes and milder
   heat extremes.},

Title = {Quantifying the Sensitivity of Precipitation to the Long-Term Warming
   Trend and Interannual-Decadal Variation of Surface Air Temperature over
   China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Precipitation is expected to increase under global warming. However,
   large discrepancies in precipitation sensitivities to global warming
   among observations and models have been reported, partly owing to the
   large natural variability of precipitation, which accounts for over 90\%
   of its total variance in China. Here, the authors first elucidated
   precipitation sensitivities to the long-term warming trend and
   interannual-decadal variations of surface air temperature T-a over China
   based on daily data from approximately 2000 stations from 1961 to 2014.
   The results show that the number of dry, trace, and light precipitation
   days has stronger sensitivities to the warming trend than to the Ta
   interannual-decadal variation, with 14.1\%, -35.7\%, and -14.6\% K-1
   versus 2.7\%, -7.9\%, and -3.1\% K-1, respectively. Total precipitation
   frequency has significant sensitivities to the warming trend ( -18.5\% K
   (1)) and the T-a interannual-decadal variation -3.6\% K-1 over China.
   However, very heavy precipitation frequencies exhibit larger
   sensitivities to the Ta interannual-decadal variation than to the
   long-term trend over Northwest and Northeast China and the Tibetan
   Plateau. A warming trend boosts precipitation intensity, especially for
   light precipitation (9.8\% K-1). Total precipitation intensity increases
   significantly by 13.1\% K-1 in response to the warming trend and by
   3.3\% K-1 in response to the Ta interannual-decadal variation. Very
   heavy precipitation intensity also shows significant sensitivity to the
   interannual-decadal variation of Ta (3.7\% K-1), particularly in the
   cold season (8.0\% K-1). Combining precipitation frequency and
   intensity, total precipitation amount has a negligible sensitivity to
   the warming trend, and the consequent trend in China is limited.
   Moderate and heavy precipitation amounts are dominated by their
   frequencies.},

Abstract = {A workshop on climate change indices was held at the Mauritius
   Meteorological Services in October 2009 to produce the first analysis of
   climate trends for the countries of the western Indian Ocean. Scientists
   brought their long-term daily temperature and precipitation for a
   careful assessment of data quality and homogeneity, and for the
   preparation of climate change indices. This paper reports on the trends
   in daily and extreme temperature and precipitation indices for
   1961-2008. The results indicate a definitive warming of surface air
   temperature at land stations. Annual means of the daytime and nighttime
   temperatures have increased at a similar rate, leading to no discernible
   change in the diurnal temperature range. Significant increasing trends
   were found in the frequency of warm days and warm nights, while
   decreasing trends were observed in the frequency of cold days and cold
   nights. Moreover, it seems that the warm extremes have changed more than
   the cold extremes in the western Indian Ocean region. Trends in
   precipitation indices are generally weak and show less spatial
   coherence. Regionally, a significant decrease was found in the annual
   total rainfall for the past 48 years. The results also show some
   increase in consecutive dry days, no change in daily intensity and
   consecutive wet days, and a decrease in extreme precipitation events.
   Temperature indices are highly correlated with sea surface temperatures
   of the region, whereas weak correlations are found with the
   precipitation indices.},

   precipitation and temperature but does not show trends in time},

Abstract = {The effects of site and climate on the self-thinning line, a key
   characteristic that defines forest dynamics, have been the subject of
   research for decades. However, contrasting results have generally been
   found. To adapt management practices for widely distributed species,
   especially considering the impact of climate change, it is crucial to
   understand the variables and their effects on the self-thinning line. We
   conducted a systematic analysis based on 77 trial plots from 62
   long-term experiments across Europe, covering the distribution range of
   Scots pine. Our focus was on unthinned conditions since 1975. Using a
   linear mixed model, we examined the effects of each statistically
   significant variable, separating the influences on the slope and the
   intercept. Our observations revealed that parameters enhancing species
   tolerance, such as shortwave solar radiation, flatten the slope of the
   self-thinning line. Conversely, temperature and precipitation, which
   reduce self-tolerance and increase intraspecific competition, lead to an
   increase in the slope. Balancing the effects between these aspects
   results in a maximum negative slope at mid-latitudes. In terms of the
   intercept, we found compensating effects among the analyzed factors,
   indicating a monotonic increase with decreasing latitude and increasing
   radiation. Although there were no significant changes in the
   self-thinning line since the 1990 s, we observed an increase in
   mortality, suggesting an accelerated self-thinning process. Site and
   climatic differences across the distribution range of Scots pine
   influenced the self-thinning line, whereas no trends with time could be
   observed. Therefore, management strategies and models based on
   self-thinning need to be adapted to different latitudes. While climate
   changes have not yet impacted the trajectory significantly, a continuous
   rise in temperature, coupled with high precipitation, may accelerate
   self-thinning and result in increased biomass accumulation.},

Abstract = {Recent climate warming has altered plant phenology at northern European
   latitudes, but conclusions regarding the spatial patterns of
   phenological change and relationships with climate are still challenging
   as quantitative estimates are strongly diverging. To generate consistent
   estimates of broad-scale spatially continuous spring plant phenology at
   northern European latitudes (>50 degrees N) from 2000 to 2016, we used a
   novel vegetation index, the plant phenology index (PPI), derived from
   MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To obtain
   realistic and strong estimates, the phenology trends and their
   relationships with temperature and precipitation over the past 17years
   were analyzed using a panel data method. We found that in the studied
   region the start of the growing season (SOS) has on average advanced by
   0.30dayyear(-1). The SOS showed an overall advancement rate of 2.47day
   degrees C-1 to spring warming, and 0.18daycm(-1) to decreasing
   precipitation in spring. The previous winter and summer temperature had
   important effects on the SOS but were spatially heterogeneous. Overall,
   the onset of SOS was delayed 0.66day degrees C-1 by winter warming and
   0.56day degrees C-1 by preceding summer warming. The precipitation in
   winter and summer influenced the SOS in a relatively weak and complex
   manner. The findings indicate rapid recent phenological changes driven
   by combined seasonal climates in northern Europe. Previously unknown
   spatial patterns of phenological change and relationships with climate
   drivers are presented that improve our capacity to understand and
   foresee future climate effects on vegetation.},

Abstract = {Quantifying variation in precipitation and drought in the context of a
   changing climate is important to assess climate-induced changes and
   propose feasible mitigation strategies, particularly in agrarian
   economies. This study investigates the main characteristics and
   historical drought trend for the period 1980-2016 using the Standard
   Precipitation Index (SPI), Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index
   (SPEI), Run Theory and Mann-Kendall Trend Test at seven stations across
   the Upper Draa Basin. The results indicate that rainfall has the largest
   magnitude over the M'semrir and Agouim (>218 mm/pa) and the lowest in
   the Agouilal, Mansour Eddahbi Dam, and Assaka subregions (104 mm-134
   mm/pa). The annual rainfall exhibited high variability with a
   coefficient of variation between 35-57\% and was positively related to
   altitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.86. However, no significant
   annual rainfall trend was detected for all stations. The drought
   analysis results showed severe drought in 1981-1984, 2000-2001, and
   2013-2014, with 2001 being the driest year during the study period and
   over 75\% of both SPEI and SPI values returned drought. Conversely, wet
   years were experienced in 1988-1990 and 2007-2010, with 1989 being the
   wettest year. The drought frequency was low (<19\%) across all the
   timescales considered for both SPI and SPEI, with Mansour Eddahbi Dam
   and Assaka recording the highest frequencies for SPI-3 and SPEI-3,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Precise analysis of spatiotemporal trends of temperature, precipitation
   and meteorological droughts plays a key role in the sustainable
   management of water resources in the given region. This study first aims
   to detect the long-term climate (monthly/seasonally and annually) trends
   from the historical temperature and precipitation data series by
   applying Spearmen's Rho and Mann-Kendall test at 5 \% significant level.
   The measurements of both climate variables for a total period of 49
   years (1965-2013) were collected from the 11 different meteorological
   stations located in the Songhua River basin of China. Secondly, the two
   well-known meteorological drought indices including the Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) were
   applied on normalize data to detect the drought hazards at 3, 6, 9 and
   12 month time scale in the study area. The analysis of monthly
   precipitation showed significant (p < 0.05) increasing trends during the
   winter (November and December months) season. Similarly, the results of
   seasonal and annual air temperature showed a significant increase from 1
   A degrees C to 1.5 A degrees C for the past 49 years in the basin.
   According to the Sen's slope estimator, the rate of increment in
   seasonal temperature slope (0.26 A degrees C/season) and precipitation
   (9.02 mm/season) were greater than annual air temperature (0.04 A
   degrees C/year) and precipitation (1.36 mm/year). By comparing the
   results of SPI and RDI indices showed good performance at 9 (r = 0.96, p
   < 0.01) and 12 (r = 0.99, p < 0.01) month drought analysis. However, the
   yearly drought analysis at over all stations indicated that a 20 years
   were under dry conditions in entire study area during 49 years. We found
   the extreme dry and wet conditions in the study region were prevailing
   during the years of 2001 and 2007, and 1994 and 2013, respectively.
   Overall, the analysis and quantifications of this study provides a
   mechanism for the policy makers to mitigate the impact of extreme
   climate and drought conditions in order to improve local water resources
   management in the region.},

Abstract = {Southern South America (SSA) is an extended region where temperature and
   precipitation daily extreme events have several impacts on the different
   socio-economic activities. In this work, their individual and compound
   occurrence over SSA and their association with atmospheric circulation
   were studied during 1979-2015, using meteorological stations and the CPC
   gridded dataset. Results were generally in good agreement between both
   datasets. The occurrence of a warm night (minimum temperature exceeding
   the 90th percentile) or a cold day (maximum temperature below the 10th
   percentile) significantly increases the probability of heavy
   precipitation (daily precipitation exceeding the 75th percentile) in
   southern Chile and southeastern South America. These compound events
   were regionally conditioned by specific circulation types. In addition,
   both individual and compound extremes showed trends in the different
   sub-regions. On one hand, heavy precipitation exhibited a significant
   increase over central-eastern Argentina and Uruguay, northeastern
   Argentina and southern Brazil during the warm season, and a significant
   decrease in central and southern Chile during the cold season. On the
   other hand, warm (cold) extremes generally presented significant upward
   (downward) trends. Compound events showed significant positive trends
   for selected regions, in some cases coincident with trends in individual
   extremes. Changes in the frequency of circulation patterns were found to
   partly influence some of these trends, like the increases in heavy
   precipitation and warm extremes during the warm season.},

Abstract = {Height growth of 19 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce
   (Picea abies) stands in Germany, Austria and Finland, for which
   long-term records of foliar nutrient levels were available, was assessed
   retrospectively by stem analyses and compared with data from regionally
   applied yield tables as references. Gridded historical time series of
   monthly temperature and precipitation were used to characterise the
   meteorologic conditions at the sampling sites. Climate parameters were
   tested against height growth in period 1950-2000, and needle N content
   was tested against height growth for the periods where N measurements
   were available by means of graphical comparison, as well as simple and
   multiple regression analyses with the aim to get evidence for causes of
   possible growth acceleration. Trends of referenced height increment of
   six out of nine Scots pine stands in Germany were positive during the
   observation period, and improved N nutrition appeared to be the most
   important driving factor for this growth acceleration. The variation of
   precipitation-exhibiting no consistent and uniform long-term temporal
   trend during the observation period-in contrast seems to be mainly
   responsible for the interannual fluctuation of height growth. We were
   not able to detect any general statistical influence of temperature
   parameters on height growth, although they generally increased. The
   referenced height growth of three Finnish pine stands slightly decreased
   during the observation period and there was no indication of a
   significant improvement of their N supply. Among four Norway spruce
   stands investigated in Germany and Austria, referenced height increment
   also increased in three cases; there was again some evidence that
   improved N nutrition was the stimulating factor. At three study sites in
   Finland, however, referenced height growth of this species decreased at
   least from 1985 onwards, whereas mostly no significant trends in N
   nutrition or precipitation were identified. These differences observed
   between species and regions are discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {Prioritizing watershed management interventions relies on delineating
   homogeneous precipitation regions. In this study, we identify these
   regions in the Brazilian Legal Amazon based on the magnitude of Sen's
   Slope trends using annual precipitation data from September to August,
   employing the Google Earth Engine platform. Utilizing the silhouette
   method, we determine four distinct clusters representing zones of
   homogeneous precipitation patterns. Cluster 0 exhibits a significant
   median increase in precipitation of 3.20 mm year(-1) over the period
   from 1981 to 2020. Cluster 1 shows a notable increase of 8.13 mm
   year(-1), while Clusters 2 and 3 demonstrate reductions in precipitation
   of - 1.61 mm year(-1) and - 3.87 mm year(-1), respectively, all
   statistically significant. Notably, the region known as the arc of
   deforestation falls within Cluster 2, indicating a concerning trend of
   reduced precipitation. Additionally, our analysis reveals significant
   correlations between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in various oceanic
   regions and precipitation patterns over the Brazilian Legal Amazon.
   Particularly noteworthy is the strong positive correlation with SST in
   the South Atlantic, while negative correlations are observed with SST in
   the South Pacific and North Atlantic. These findings provide valuable
   insights for enhancing climate adaptation strategies in the Brazilian
   Legal Amazon region.},

Title = {Long-term trends in precipitation and temperature in the Norwegian
   Arctic: can they be explained by changes in atmospheric circulation

Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Observations from the Norwegian Arctic show positive trends in annual
   mean temperatures from 1912 to the 1930s and from the 1960s to 1996.
   Between these periods there was a negative trend, and there is no
   statistically significant trend in the record as a whole. The present
   temperature is approximately the same as in the 1920s, and lower than
   during the 1930s and 1950s. Spring is the only season which shows a
   statistically significant warming from 1912 to 1996. Annual
   precipitation, on the other hand, has increased in the Norwegian Arctic.
   At Spitsbergen the measurements show a statistically significant
   increase in annual and in spring, summer and autumn precipitation.
   Monthly values of mean sea level pressure of 4 grid points were used to
   develop models for monthly mean temperature and monthly precipitation at
   Spitsbergen. During the period 1912 to 1993 the temperature model
   accounts for 30 to 45\% of the variance in the seasonal mean
   temperatures. The correlation between observed and modelled values is at
   a minimum in the summer and at a maximum in the autumn. The
   precipitation model accounts for 15 to 35\% of the variance in seasonal
   precipitation sums. The correlation between observed and modelled values
   is lowest in winter, when the problems with drifting and blowing snow
   are greatest. Even though the observed and modelled seasonal values in
   most cases are better correlated for temperature than for precipitation,
   the precipitation model accounts for more of the decadal scale
   variability and long-term trends. The precipitation model reproduces the
   observed positive precipitation trends on both a seasonal and annual
   basis. Concerning decadal scale variability, most of the main observed
   features are also modelled satisfactorily. It is concluded that the
   major observed features concerning decadal scale variability and trends
   in precipitation at Spitsbergen are connected to variability in the
   atmospheric circulation pattern. The temperature model reproduces
   reasonably well the observed positive trend during the last 3 decades of
   the series. The very low temperature before 1920 and the high values in
   the 1930s and the 1950s, on the other hand, are not modelled
   satisfactorily. Thus, while the temperature increase of the later
   decades may mainly be explained as a result of changes in advection, the
   temperature increases in the Norwegian Arctic from the beginning of the
   measurements to the 1930s cannot be explained in this way.},

Title = {Trend in Extreme Precipitation Indices Based on Long Term In Situ
   Precipitation Records over Pakistan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Assessing the long-term precipitation changes is of utmost importance
   for understanding the impact of climate change. This study investigated
   the variability of extreme precipitation events over Pakistan on the
   basis of daily precipitation data from 51 weather stations from
   1980-2016. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope estimator, least
   squares method, and two-tailed simple t-test methods were used to assess
   the trend in eight precipitation extreme indices. These indices were wet
   days (R1 >= 1 mm), heavy precipitation days (R10 >= 10 mm), very heavy
   precipitation days (R20 >= 20 mm), severe precipitation (R50 >= 50 mm),
   very wet days (R95p) defining daily precipitation >= 95 percentile,
   extremely wet days (R99p) defining daily precipitation >= 99 percentile,
   annual total precipitation in wet days (PRCPTOT), and mean precipitation
   amount on wet days as simple daily intensity index (SDII). The study is
   unique in terms of using high stations' density, extended temporal
   coverage, advanced statistical techniques, and additional extreme
   indices. Furthermore, this study is the first of its kind to detect
   abrupt changes in the temporal trend of precipitation extremes over
   Pakistan. The results showed that the spatial distribution of trends in
   different precipitation extreme indices over the study region increased
   as a whole; however, the monsoon and westerlies humid regions
   experienced a decreasing trend of extreme precipitation indices during
   the study period. The results of the sequential Mann-Kendall (SqMK) test
   showed that all precipitation extremes exhibited abrupt dynamic changes
   in temporal trend during the study period; however, the most frequent
   mutation points with increasing tendency were observed during 2011 and
   onward. The results further illustrated that the linear trend of all
   extreme indices showed an increasing tendency from 1980- 2016.
   Similarly, for elevation, most of the precipitation extremes showed an
   inverse relationship, suggesting a decrease of precipitation along the
   latitudinal extent of the country. The spatiotemporal variations in
   precipitation extremes give a possible indication of the ongoing
   phenomena of climate change and variability that modified the
   precipitation regime of Pakistan. On the basis of the current findings,
   the study recommends that future studies focus on underlying physical
   and natural drivers of precipitation variability over the study region.},

Abstract = {As the effects of global warming on climate have a wide spatial
   variability, regional studies of temporal climate trends are critical.
   This study investigates the effect of global warming on temperature and
   precipitation trends in the Yellow, Yangtze and Pearl River basins (the
   Three Basins) of China over the past 58 years (1956-2013). Over this
   time period, the mean warming rate in the Three Basins (0.22 degrees
   C/10 yr) was close to that for the global land surface (0.21 degrees
   C/10 yr). However, the warming rate showed high spatial variability
   across the study region, ranging from 0.05 degrees C/10 yr to 0.49
   degrees C/10 yr. These rates tend to increase with latitude and
   elevation and toward very large cities (e.g., Shanghai). The warming
   rate in the Three Basins varied by season, it was lower in summer (0.14
   degrees C/10 yr) and higher in winter (0.29 degrees C/10 yr). In spite
   of the warming trend, no statistically significant increase or decrease
   in precipitation was found for the Three Basins over the past 58 years.

Abstract = {Most climate models for the Caribbean predict drying trends, increased
   temperature, and precipitation variability. We used regression analyses
   to evaluate how global predictions translated into local temporal
   patterns of climatic variation within the Luquillo Mountains in Puerto
   Rico, and which variables were more useful for expressing precipitation
   and temperature variability trends there. We used cross-correlation
   analyses to evaluate how local precipitation and temperature data
   related to regional atmosphere-ocean teleconnections indices (ENSO, NAO,
   TNA, and AMO). Contrary to regional climate predictions, we found an
   increase in mean annual precipitation during the dry season, and no
   trends in annual and wet season precipitation data sets were observed.
   Precipitation variance increased after 1995, but only when considering
   dry season data, which showed a decrease in the total number and
   consecutive days without rain after 1995. In agreement with regional
   predictions, maximum and minimum annual mean temperatures increased
   between 1975 and 2015. We found strong positive associations between
   maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall distribution (i.e. more
   wet days, less dry intervals). Precipitation and temperature were more
   strongly associated to changes in the Tropical Atlantic than to changes
   in the North Atlantic or the Eastern Pacific. Our downscaling analysis
   (one station data) shows the relevance of evaluating global climate
   predictions in specific areas where landscape features can modify the
   patterns observed at bigger scales. The combination of downscaling
   analysis and the inclusion of long-term climate trends can facilitate
   the development of better future scenarios of climate variability and
   evaluate their importance to local forest ecosystems.},

Abstract = {The northeast region of Cote d'Ivoire, where agriculture is the main
   economic activity, is potentially vulnerable to extreme climatic
   conditions. This study aims to make a comprehensive spatio-temporal
   analysis of trends in extreme indices related to precipitation and
   temperature for the Zanzan region of Cote d'Ivoire over the period of
   1981-2020. The statistical significance of the calculated trends was
   assessed using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, while Sen's slope
   estimation was used to define the amount of change. For extreme
   precipitations, the results showed a decreasing trend in annual total
   precipitations estimated at 112.37 mm and in daily precipitations
   intensity indices. Furthermore, the consecutive dry days' index showed
   an increasing trend estimated at 18.67 days. Unlike the trends in
   precipitation extremes, which showed statistically non-significant
   trends, the trends in temperature extremes were mostly significant over
   the entire study area. The cold spells indices all show decreasing
   trends, while the warm spells show increasing trends. Drawing inferences
   from the results, it becomes clear that the study area may be threatened
   by food insecurity and water scarcity. The results are aimed to support
   climate adaptation efforts and policy intervention in the region.},

Abstract = {The subject of change detection in climate time series has recently
   received greater interest as the perception of a human-induced change in
   the climate is now widely accepted. However, changes in regional
   precipitation and temperature remain uncertain. This study characterizes
   projected fine-scale changes in precipitation and temperature in
   continental Southeast Asia over the period 1960-2049. Twenty four annual
   variables were derived from grid-based daily precipitation and
   temperature produced by the PRECIS regional climate model under A2 and
   B2 scenarios. These time series, capturing precipitation intensities
   (classified as low, medium and high), seasonality and extremes in
   precipitation and temperature, were subjected to the modified
   Mann-Kendall trend detection test accounting for long-term persistence.
   The results indicate that temperature increases over the whole region
   with steeper trends in higher latitudes. Increases in annual
   precipitation, mainly restricted to Myanmar and the Gulf of Thailand,
   result from increases in high precipitation during the wet season.
   Decreases are observed mainly over the sea and caused by a reduction of
   low precipitation. Changes in the occurrence of the monsoon affect the
   low-latitude sea areas only. By showing that significant precipitation
   change are minor over land areas, these results challenge most of the
   previous studies that suggested significant precipitation changes over
   Southeast Asia, often mixing up multi-decadal variability and long-term
   unidirectional trends. Significant changes in precipitation and
   temperature may induce higher agricultural yields as steepest
   temperature and precipitation increases will predominantly affect the
   coldest and driest land areas of the region.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Observed daily precipitation and near surface air temperature data from
   34 synoptic weather stations in the Philippines for the period 1951-2010
   were subjected to trend analysis which revealed an overall warming
   tendency compared to the normal mean values for the period 1961-1990.
   This warming trend can be observed in the annual mean temperatures,
   daily minimum mean temperatures and to a lesser extent, daily maximum
   mean temperatures. Precipitation and temperature extremes for the period
   1951-2010 were also analysed relative to the mean 1961-1990 baseline
   values. Some stations (Cotabato, Iloilo, Laoag and Tacloban,) show
   increases in both frequency and intensity of extreme daily rainfall
   events which are significant at the 95\% level with none of the stations
   showing decreasing trends. The frequency of daily temperature maximum
   above the 99th percentile (hot days) and nights at the 1st percentile
   (cold nights) suggests that both days and nights in particular are
   becoming warmer. Such indicators of a warming trend and increase in
   extreme events in the Philippines are discussed in the context of
   similar national, regional (Asia Pacific) and global studies. The
   relevance of such empirically based climatology studies, particularly
   for nations such as the Philippines which are increasingly vulnerable to
   the multiple impacts of global climate change, is also considered. (C)

Abstract = {Long-term changes in extreme daily and subdaily precipitation simulated
   by climate models are often compared with corresponding temperature
   changes to estimate the sensitivity of extreme precipitation to warming.
   Such ``trend scaling'' rates are difficult to estimate from
   observations, however, because of limited data availability and high
   background variability. Intra-annual temperature scaling (here called
   binning scaling), which relates extreme precipitation to temperature at
   or near the time of occurrence, has been suggested as a possible
   substitute for trend scaling. Weuse a large ensemble simulation of the
   Canadian regional climate model (CanRCM4) to assess this possibility,
   considering both daily near-surface air temperature and daily dewpoint
   temperature as scaling variables. Wefind that binning curves that are
   based on precipitation data for the whole year generally look like the
   composite of binning curves for winter and summer, with the lower
   temperature portion similar to winter and the higher temperature portion
   similar to summer, indicating that binning curves reflect seasonal
   changes in the relationship between temperature and extreme
   precipitation. The magnitude and spatial pattern of binning and trend
   scaling rates are also quantitatively different, with little spatial
   correlation between them, regardless of precipitation duration or choice
   of temperature variable. The evidence therefore suggests that binning
   scaling with temperature is not a reliable predictor for future changes
   in precipitation extremes in the climate simulated by CanRCM4.
   Nevertheless, external forcing does have a discernable influence on
   binning curves, which are seen to shift upward and to the right in some
   regions, consistent with a general increase in extreme precipitation.},

Abstract = {This paper pursues two objectives: first, to determine the trends of
   seasonal and annual precipitation in the Canary Islands and, second, to
   identify trends in the daily precipitation concentration index (CI). For
   the first objective, we used data from 1970-2013 of 23 rainfall stations
   located on different islands, after verifying the homogeneity of their
   series. For the second, the sample was reduced to eleven series since
   deficiencies in data records of less than 1 mm of daily precipitation
   were appreciated. We used the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test to
   determine whether the series showed linear trends in annual and seasonal
   precipitation and in the values of CI. The seasonal results showed
   negative trends in spring and winter in almost all the time series
   considered, especially in the north of Gran Canaria and Tenerife.
   Conversely, 78\% of the series in autumn recorded an increase in the
   precipitation. The annual balance indicated a decline of rainfall in
   most of the locations, because of the high concentration of
   precipitation in winter. Finally, most of the time series exhibited a
   trend toward a greater concentration of daily rainfall, in particular
   those series located in areas where the main towns are settled, which is
   an important issue to consider because of severe flooding and other
   geomorphological processes.},

Abstract = {Trends of extreme precipitation (EP) using various combinations of
   average return intervals (ARIs) of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 years with
   durations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 days were calculated regionally
   across the contiguous United States. Changes in the sign of the trend of
   EP vary by region as well as by ARI and duration, despite the
   statistically significant upward trends for all combinations of EP
   thresholds when area averaged across the contiguous United States.
   Spatially, there is a pronounced east-to-west gradient in the trends of
   the EP with strong upward trends east of the Rocky Mountains. In
   general, upward trends are larger and more significant for longer ARIs,
   but the contribution to the trend in total seasonal and annual
   precipitation is significantly larger for shorter ARIs because they
   occur more frequently. Across much of the contiguous United States,
   upward trends of warm-season EP are substantially larger than those for
   the cold season and have a substantially greater effect on the annual
   trend in total precipitation. This result occurs even in areas where the
   total precipitation is nearly evenly divided between the cold and warm
   seasons. When compared with short-duration events, long-duration
   events-for example, 30 days-contribute the most to annual trends.
   Coincident statistically significant upward trends of EP and
   precipitable water (PW) occur in many regions, especially during the
   warm season. Increases in PW are likely to be one of several factors
   responsible for the increase in EP (and average total precipitation)
   observed in many areas across the contiguous United States.},

Title = {Precipitation Trends over the Indus Basin},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A large population relies on water input to the Indus basin, yet
   basinwide precipitation amounts and trends are not well quantified.
   Gridded precipitation data sets covering different time periods and
   based on either station observations, satellite remote sensing, or
   reanalysis were compared with available station observations and
   analyzed for basinwide precipitation trends. Compared to observations,
   some data sets tended to greatly underestimate precipitation, while
   others overestimate it. Additionally, the discrepancies between data set
   and station precipitation showed significant time trends in many cases,
   suggesting that the precipitation trends of those data sets were not
   consistent with station data. Among the data sets considered, the
   station-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) gridded
   data set showed good agreement with observations in terms of mean
   amount, trend, and spatial and temporal pattern. GPCC had average
   precipitation of about 500 mm per year over the basin and an increase in
   mean precipitation of about 15\% between 1891 and 2016. For the more
   recent past, since 1958 or 1979, no significant precipitation trend was
   seen. Among the remote sensing based data sets, the Tropical Rainfall
   Measuring Mission Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) compared
   best to station observations and, though available for a shorter time
   period than station-based data sets such as GPCC, may be especially
   valuable for parts of the basin without station data. The reanalyses
   tended to have substantial biases in precipitation mean amount or trend
   relative to the station data. This assessment of precipitation data set
   quality and precipitation trends over the Indus basin may be helpful for
   water planning and management.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Canadian prairies are a major producer of grain, much of which is
   produced under rain-fed agriculture. The amount and timing of
   precipitation are critical to grain production. Information on the
   precipitation trend is therefore vital to this region. Regression
   analysis was used to establish linear trends of precipitation amounts,
   number of precipitation events, and variance of precipitation at 37
   stations with 75 yr of record across the Canadian prairies. The
   precipitation was further split into rainfall and snowfall, and similar
   analysis was performed on these variables. The analysis showed that
   there has been a significant increase in the number of precipitation
   events mainly due to an increase in the number of low-intensity events.
   As such,precipitation events are not getting more intense on the
   Canadian prairies. The number of precipitation events (excluding events
   that are 0.5 mm or less) has increased by 16 events during the last 75
   yr. Precipitation and rainfall amounts have increased significantly by
   0.62 and 0.60 mm yr(-1), respectively, on the Canadian prairies during
   the last 75 yr. During the period from 1921 to 1960 the trends in
   precipitation, rainfall, and snowfall were not statistically different
   from zero. However, from 1961 to 1995, snowfall has declined
   significantly by 0.95 mm yr(-1). The trends in the most recent period
   (1961-95) were also significantly different from those in the 1921-60
   period for snowfall. The difference in trends between the two periods
   for snowfall, combined with the inverse relationship in the
   rainfall-snowfall trends, suggest that these trends may be related to
   climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper applies a procedure that identifies trends in monthly
   precipitation totals across Turkey. The procedure utilizes the regional
   average Mann-Kendall non-parametric test with both serial and
   cross-correlation to detect trends for a network of 52 Turkish
   precipitation gauging stations for a 30-year period (1968-1997) in seven
   geographical regions of Turkey. The application of regional trend
   analysis confirmed spatial and temporal changes in the behaviour of
   precipitation over Turkey. The regional trend analysis revealed that
   almost no evidence of significant change was experienced with a general
   upward regional direction appearing primarily in the Black Sea,
   Mediterranean Sea, Southeastern Anatolia, Eastern Anatolia regions and
   partly in the Marmara region compared to the Central Anatolia and Aegean
   regions. The regional insignificant increasing trends appeared to be
   dominant starting from June ending with December all over Turkey. In
   contrast, the most number of regional insignificant decreasing trends
   were obtained in January and spring months over Turkey except for the
   Southeastern Anatolia and Black Sea regions with some significant trends
   in the Aegean region.},

Title = {Precipitation intensity trends in northern Italy},

Abstract = {Recent studies on changes in precipitation intensity encompassing North
   America have found evidence for an increase in the relative amount of
   precipitation contributed by heavy and extreme rainfall events in the
   last 80 years. Within this context, the purpose of this paper is to
   verify whether such a signal can also be detected in northern Italy,
   where daily precipitation data are available from the beginning of the
   19th century. The analysis is performed by applying the non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test to mean anomaly series obtained through averaging the
   anomalies of some precipitation intensity statistics over five stations:
   Genoa (1833-1998), Milan (1858-1998), Mantova (1868-1997), Bologna
   (1879-1998) and Ferrara (1879-1996). It provides evidence that in
   northern Italy, the number of rainy days has a stronger and more
   significant negative trend than the corresponding precipitation amount,
   both on a yearly basis and in all of the seasons. As a consequence,
   precipitation intensity has a positive trend. The increase in
   precipitation intensity causes a significant positive trend in the
   proportion of total precipitation contributed by heavy precipitation
   events (i.e. daily precipitation > 25 mm and daily precipitation > 50
   mm). The trend is mainly caused by the last 60-80 years, and is
   particularly evident in the periods of 1930-1945 and 1975-1995. The
   increase in precipitation intensity is connected to a modification of
   the distribution of daily precipitation values in a year, with trends
   that grow from the lower to the upper percentiles, and up to 4 mm/100
   years for the 95th percentile. Copyright (C) 2000 Royal Meteorological

Abstract = {This study aims to determine trends in the long-term annual mean and
   monthly total precipitation series using nonparametric methods (i.e. the
   Mann-Kendall and Sen's T tests). The change per unit time in a time
   series having a linear trend was estimated by applying a simple
   non-parametric procedure, namely Sen's estimator of slope. Serial
   correlation structure in the data was accounted for determining the
   significance level of the results of the Mann-Kendall test. The data
   network used in this study, which is assumed to reflect regional
   hydroclimatic conditions, consists of 96 precipitation stations across
   Turkey. Monthly totals and annual means of the monthly totals are formed
   for each individual station, spanning from 1929 to 1993. In this case, a
   total of 13 precipitation variables at each station are subjected to
   trend detection analysis. In addition, regional average precipitation
   series are established for the same analysis purpose. The application of
   a trend detection framework resulted in the identification of some
   significant trends, especially in January, February, and September
   precipitations and in the annual means. A noticeable decrease in the
   annual mean precipitation was observed mostly in western and southern
   Turkey, as well as along the coasts of the Black Sea. Regional average
   series also displayed trends similar to those for individual stations.

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An analysis of extreme precipitation events indicates that there has
   been a sizable increase in their frequency since the 1920s/1930s in the
   U. S. There has been no discernible trend in the frequency of the most
   extreme events in Canada, but the frequency of less extreme events has
   increased in some parts of Canada, notably in the Arctic. In the U. S.,
   frequencies in the late 1800s/early 1900s were about as high as in the
   1980s/1990s. This suggests that natural variability of the climate
   system could be the cause of the recent increase, although anthropogenic
   forcing due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations cannot be
   discounted as another cause. It is likely that anthropogenic forcing
   will eventually cause global increases in extreme precipitation,
   primarily because of probable increases in atmospheric water vapor
   content and destabilization of the atmosphere. However, the location,
   timing, and magnitude of local and regional changes remain unknown
   because of uncertainties about future changes in the frequency/intensity
   of meteorological systems that cause extreme precipitation.},

Abstract = {Across the globe, wind speed trends have shown a slight decline for in
   situ meteorological datasets. Yet few studies have assessed long-term
   wind speed trends for alpine regions or how such trends could influence
   snow transport and distribution. Alpine-region meteorological stations
   are sparsely distributed, and their records are short. To increase
   spatial and temporal coverage, use of modeled data is appealing, but the
   level of agreement between modeled and in situ data is unknown for
   alpine regions. Data agreement, temporal trends, and the potential
   effects on snow distribution were evaluated using two in situ sites in
   an alpine region {[}Niwot Ridge in Colorado and the Glacier Lakes
   Ecological Experiments Station (GLEES) in Wyoming] and the corresponding
   grid cells of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).
   Temperature, precipitation, and wind speed variables were used to assess
   blowing-snow trends at annual, seasonal, and daily scales. The
   correlation between NARR and in situ datasets showed that temperature
   data were correlated but that wind speed and precipitation were not.
   NARR wind speed data were systematically lower when compared with in
   situ data, yet the frequency of wind events was captured. Overall, there
   were not many significant differences between NARR and in situ wind
   speed trends at annual, seasonal, and daily scales, aside from GLEES
   daily values. This finding held true even when trends presented opposite
   signatures and slopes, which was likely a result of low trend slopes.
   The lack of agreement between datasets prohibited the use of NARR to
   broaden analyses for blowing-snow dynamics in alpine regions.},

Abstract = {The MannKendall test, wavelet analysis was used to analyse the long-term
   trends and periodicities in temperature, precipitation and streamflow in
   China's Shiyang River Basin since 1950. The Principal components
   analysis (PCA) was used to quantify the impacts of climate change and
   human activities on water resources. The annual mean air temperature has
   increased, consistent with increasing global temperatures. The annual
   precipitation fluctuated but has generally increased since the 1990s.
   The air temperature and precipitation showed changes on periods ranging
   from 2 to 28 years. The correlation between annual runoff and
   precipitation variation was 0.61 (P<0.05), indicating precipitation is
   the main source of the runoff. Human activities played the dominant role
   in the lower reaches, accounting for 58.5\% of the total effect. The
   results have important implications for water resources management to
   support harmonisation of the relationship between humans and nature to
   combat the effect of climate.},

Title = {Variability in Projected North American Mean and Extreme Temperature and
   Precipitation Trends for the 21st Century: Model-To-Model Differences
   Versus Internal Variability},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While climate change is expected to alter mean and extreme temperature
   and precipitation over the 21st century, regional changes in these
   fields remain difficult to project. For a given future emissions
   scenario, the uncertainty in future projections can be attributed to
   either model-to-model differences, which can presumably be reduced if
   models are improved, or internal variability, which cannot be
   constrained to a single outcome but can be used to quantify a range of
   plausible outcomes. This study examines the range of possible trends in
   North American mean and extreme temperature and precipitation across
   phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models under the
   SSP3-7.0 emissions scenario. While model-to-model differences primarily
   govern the spread in mean and extreme temperature trends across these
   model simulations, the spread in mean and extreme precipitation trends
   is dominated by internal variability in many regions. A storylines
   approach-a type of regression-based analysis-is used to identify key
   dynamical drivers that explain the variance in future trends across
   model simulations. The dynamical drivers considered include trends in
   global mean surface temperature (GMST) and four common modes of climate
   variability. Combinations of these drivers can reinforce each other to
   create high-impact storylines. For example, model simulations with large
   positive GMST and El Nino-Southern Oscillation trends are associated
   with a large reduction in the annual maximum number of consecutive dry
   days in the American Southwest. However, limiting these storylines to
   only models with climate sensitivities consistent with observational
   constraints reduces the likelihood of a large reduction of consecutive
   dry days in this region. Plain Language Summary As the globe warms over
   the 21st century as a result of increased human greenhouse gas
   emissions, changes in mean and extreme temperature and precipitation are
   expected across North America. Projecting these changes, however, is
   challenging due to large uncertainty in future emissions, computer model
   physics, and inherent uncertainty in the climate known as internal
   variability. The goal of this study is to investigate future mean and
   extreme temperature and precipitation trends and discern the type of
   uncertainty that best explains the variability in future projections.
   Importantly, variance in future projections that is the result of model
   physics uncertainty can be constrained with model improvement, while
   variance in future projections due to internal variability cannot. For
   example, excluding models with unreasonably high levels of future global
   warming would reduce the uncertainty in future regional temperature
   trends and trends in the length of dry periods in the American
   Southwest.},

Title = {Trends of precipitation characteristics in the Czech Republic over

Abstract = {Daily precipitation data from 162 stations in the Czech Republic over
   1961-2012 are used to examine changes in seasonal precipitation indices,
   their spatial patterns and links to temperature and atmospheric
   circulation. The results show a divide between the western and eastern
   parts of the country as to trends in most precipitation characteristics
   in both winter and summer. Increases were more pronounced in the west,
   where Atlantic influences are stronger. In the eastern region, where
   continental and Mediterranean influences become more important, the
   trends are often inconclusive. Aggregated over the country as a whole,
   positive trends of mean precipitation as well as indices of
   precipitation intensity and extremes dominate in both winter and summer,
   and the mean precipitation trends are significant at a much larger
   percentage of stations than previously reported for 1961-2005. Spring is
   the only season with prevailing negative trends in mean precipitation
   and the number of wet days. The trends are least conclusive and close to
   zero in autumn. The trends differ for cold days (below the seasonal 25th
   percentile of daily maximum temperature) and warm days (above the
   seasonal 75th percentile). In contrast to overall winter trends,
   negative trends of mean precipitation, seasonal maxima and number of wet
   days prevail on cold days in winter. In summer, by far the most
   pronounced positive trends occur during warm days, when most
   precipitation comes from convective storms. Longitudinal dependency was
   found for most indices in winter and for mean precipitation and the
   number of wet days in summer. The different influence of the North
   Atlantic Oscillation on precipitation in the western and eastern parts
   of the Czech Republic together with positive (negative) trend of the
   North Atlantic Oscillation index in winter (summer) may contribute to
   the longitudinal dependency of the precipitation trends.},

Abstract = {The investigation of the trend change of climatic parameters during a
   time scale is one of the most important issues of climatological
   research. Awareness of the trend of climatic variables is essential for
   different disciplines such as agriculturists, water managers, irrigation
   engineers, policymakers, and so on, to make climate-based future
   projections. In this study, different traditional and relatively new
   method(s) namely the Mann Kendall test, Spearman's Rho, Regression test,
   and Innovative Sen trend test were used to determine the trend change of
   air temperature (T), and precipitation (P) climatological parameters of
   the Hatay region as a case study. Additionally, the trend of the flow
   rate of some gauge stations located in the same basin was investigated.
   Results of methods were compared, and the general trend of the
   climatological parameters was evaluated based on all used approaches.
   The methods used were applied in monthly, seasonal, and annual time
   scales. Only annual graphs were presented to mitigate
   overrepresentation, and the results of all given time scales were shared
   with tables. According to the models performed, strikingly, it is
   evident that there is a significant increasing trend of air temperature
   and decreasing trend of total precipitation in the study area.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the trends of precipitation and temperature
   extremes for the historical observations (1961-1990) and future period
   (2061-2090) in the Jhelum River Basin. Future trends are estimated by
   using ensemble mean of three general circulation models under RCP4.5 and
   RCP8.5. Therefore, statistical downscaling model has been used to
   downscale the future precipitation and temperature. A total of 15
   precipitation and temperature indices were calculated using the RClimdex
   package. Man-Kendall and Sen's slope tests were used to detect the
   trends in climate extreme indices. Overall, the results of study
   indicate that there were significant changes in precipitation and
   temperature patterns as well as in the climate extremes in the basin for
   both observed as well as projected climate. Generally, more warming and
   increase in precipitation were observed, which increases from RCP4.5 to
   RCP8.5. For all the stations, increasing trends were found for both
   precipitation and temperature for twenty-first century at a 95\%
   significance level. The frequency of warm days (TX90p), warm nights
   (TN90p), and summer days (SU25) showed significant increasing trends,
   alternatively the number of cold nights (TN10p) and cold days (TX10p)
   exhibited opposite behaviors. In addition, an increasing trend of
   warmest day (TXx) and coldest day (TNn) was observed. Our analysis also
   reveals that the number of very wet days (R90p) and heavy precipitation
   days (R10 mm) will likely increase in the future. Meanwhile, the Max
   1-day (RX1-day) and 5-day (RX5-day) precipitation indices showed
   increasing trends at most of the stations of basin. The results of the
   study is of potential benefit for decision-makers to develop basin wide
   appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures to combat climate change
   and its consequences.},

   (1951-1990)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN},

Abstract = {The time-space structures of long-term trends and the decadal-scale
   variations of seasonal temperature and precipitation over China and
   Mongolia are investigated by using the 5-year moving averaged data from
   1951 to 1990. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) technique is
   applied to seasonal temperature and precipitation. The changes of
   atmospheric circulation patterns with these trends, and long-term
   fluctuations are deduced by using 500 hPa height and surface pressure
   fields. The correspondence of these components with the Northern
   Hemispheric surface air temperature (NHT) is examined.
   The increasing linear trend in the annual mean temperature is
   remarkable, especially in the northern part of China and Mongolia, while
   the decreasing trend is conspicuous in the area from Sichuan to Yunnan
   Province, The increasing trend in the annual mean temperature is due
   mostly to the anomalies in winter and spring. These trends in winter
   temperature are directly related to the decadal-scale change of the
   locations of Siberian High and mid-tropospheric trough over Eurasia, and
   are associated with the hemispheric circulation changes.
   The annual precipitation, in contrast, does not show a clear linear
   trend over the whole of China except in the southern part of China,
   where a significant increasing trend is noted. Summer precipitation
   shows a remarkable decadal-scale fluctuation in the first two dominant
   EOF modes. The first EOF represents the increasing trend in the middle
   and northwest part of China, while the second EOF represents the
   oscillation between the southern part of China and the rest of the
   country, which is closely related to the summertime NHT.},

Title = {Observed and projected trends of extreme precipitation and maximum

   and copula theory},

Abstract = {Meteorological extreme events have a major impact on water resources,
   economic development, and ecosystem health. In this study, maximum
   precipitation and maximum temperature indices were derived for Isfahan
   province, in central Iran, over the historical (1992-2017) and future
   (2020-2100) periods. Precipitation and maximum temperature data from the
   REMO model under RCP4.5 scenario were used to investigate changes in
   extreme values over the future period. The results showed that extreme
   precipitation in the historical and future periods has respectively a
   decreasing and increasing trend. Based on the extreme indices,
   temperature in the study area has a significant increasing trend in the
   baseline and future period. Various combinations of extreme
   precipitation indicators were created for joint modeling by copula
   theory. Copula modeling for the three weather stations for which REMO
   had satisfactory performance in simulating extremes over the historic
   period showed that the average return period of extreme precipitation
   combinations will be reduced in the future period compared to the
   historical period at Daran and Shahreza, while the average return period
   of combinations will have both increasing and decreasing trends at
   Naeen.
   Recommendations for Resource Managers
   Knowing information about the probability of occurrence of extreme
   precipitation with a certain value that exceeds a certain threshold will
   help planning for water resource systems under drought conditions and
   future increasing temperature.
   The joint return period of extreme precipitation can help to know the
   return period of extreme events such as floods and droughts.
   The findings of this study are important to assess the prediction of
   climate extreme. Also, these results can be useful to provide the
   appropriate strategies for water resources managers in drought
   conditions under future increasing temperature.},

   addition to statistical analysis such as Mann-Kendall (MK) and SR,
   innovative polygon trend analysis (IPTA), innovative trend analysis

   methods were used in the study. A total of 24 trend analyses (for 12
   months of precipitation and temperature data) were conducted for each
   method used for temperature and precipitation parameters in the study.
   Looking at the results of these methods, a decreasing trend was detected
   only in December for precipitation data, common to all methods. For
   temperature data, an increasing trend was detected only in February and
   March. With the application of the IPTA, an increasing trend in some
   months and a decreasing trend in other months were detected for the two
   parameters. The Wilcoxon test exhibits significant consistency with the
   MK and Spearman's Rho (SR) in terms of the statistical trend, according
   to the examination of temperature and precipitation data using the CWTSD
   approach, which is relatively recent. Furthermore, the visual trend
   analysis demonstrates high consistency between the NO-ITA and Sen-ITA

Abstract = {Climate data from the southwest coast of the Caspian Sea (CS) were
   statistically analysed to find connections with large-scale atmospheric
   variabilities and regional impacts. The study area is characterized by a
   subtropical humid climate. This enclave of high precipitation is
   extremely important for Iranian food production and is recognized for
   its high biodiversity. The data sets were investigated for
   inconsistencies before carrying out the main investigations, and several
   problems have been identified. The results show three distinct climatic
   periods in the temperature time series since 1956: 1956 to 1975 with
   values near to the overall mean, 1977 to 1995 with values lower by 0.5
   degrees C and from 1996 to 2010 with values higher by 0.5 degrees C.
   These periods can be positively correlated with rapid sea level changes
   of the CS. Moreover, an agreement exists between the three climatic
   periods and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variability. The sea
   surface temperature of the southern CS is shown to be the driving force
   of the 2m temperatures in the study area. While temperature changes are
   in accordance with NAO variability, the precipitation variations show
   connections with ENSO and less with NAO. The trends of precipitation
   during the period are diverse but display mostly a weak decrease, while
   the trends of temperature display a clear increase, larger than that for
   global mean temperatures, overlaid with inter-decadal variations.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1990s, Meteo-France has used an automatic system
   combining three numerical models to simulate meteorological parameters,
   snow cover stratification, and avalanche risk at various altitudes,
   aspects, and slopes for a number of mountainous regions in France. Given
   the lack of sufficient directly observed long-term snow data, this
   ``SAFRAN''-Crocus-{''}MEPRA'' (SCM) model chain, usually applied to
   operational avalanche forecasting, has been used to carry out and
   validate retrospective snow and weather climate analyses for the
   1958-2002 period. The SAFRAN 2-m air temperature and precipitation
   climatology shows that the climate of the French Alps is temperate and
   is mainly determined by atmospheric westerly flow conditions. Vertical
   profiles of temperature and precipitation averaged over the whole period
   for altitudes up to 3000 m MSL show a relatively linear variation with
   altitude for different mountain areas with no constraint of that kind
   imposed by the analysis scheme itself. Over the observation period
   1958-2002, the overall trend corresponds to an increase in the annual
   near-surface air temperature of about 1 degrees C. However, variations
   are large at different altitudes and for different seasons and regions.
   This significantly positive trend is most obvious in the 1500-2000-m MSL
   altitude range, especially in the northwest regions, and exhibits a
   significant relationship with the North Atlantic Oscillation index over
   long periods. Precipitation data are diverse, making it hard to identify
   clear trends within the high year-to-year variability.},

   extent the Mediterranean Sea is contributing to this change in climatic
   conditions. The results have shown that there are certain climatic
   variables, such as tropical nights and intense precipitation, which in
   recent decades have been increasing in the study area. The reason is due
   to several factors, although the continuous increase in the surface
   temperature of the Mediterranean Sea seems to be playing a

Abstract = {The northern sub-Himalayan region is the primary source of water for a
   large part of Pakistan. Changes in precipitation and precipitation
   extremes in the area may have severe impacts on water security and
   hydrology of Pakistan. The objective of the study is to evaluate the
   spatial characteristics of the trends in annual and seasonal
   precipitation and precipitation extremes in Gilgit Baltistan, the
   northern administrative territory of Pakistan surrounded by Hindu Kush,
   Karakoram, and the Himalayan regions. The daily gridded rainfall data
   (1951-2007) of Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data
   Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) at 0.25 degrees spatial
   resolution was used for evaluating the trends. The novelty of the
   present study is the application of the modified Mann-Kendall (MMK)
   trend for the evaluation of the significance of precipitation trends in
   order to differentiate the secular trends from climate natural
   variability. Besides, cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots of
   daily rainfall for the early (1951-1980) and later (1981-2007) periods
   were used to show the changes in extremes. The results revealed no
   significant change in annual precipitation but increase in summer
   rainfall in the range of 0.25 to 1.25mm/year in the upper part and
   decrease in winter precipitation from 0 to -0.25mm/year in the west part
   of the region. Annual number of rainy days was also found to decrease in
   winter up to -1.33days/decade where the region receives a major portion
   of total precipitation. The decrease in winter rainfall and rainy days
   caused an increase in continuous dry days (around 0.27days/year) and
   decrease in continuous wet days (up to -0.26days/year). Trend analysis
   and CDF plot revealed that though the numbers of rainy days are
   decreasing, the numbers of extreme rainfall days are increasing, which
   indicates rainfall become more erratic and intense in the region. The
   increases in both continuous dry days and extreme rainfall days indicate
   more droughts and floods may have adverse impacts on the hydrology of
   Pakistan.},

Title = {A new tool for monthly precipitation analysis in Spain: MOPREDAS

Abstract = {A new monthly precipitation database has been developed for conterminous
   provinces in Spain by exploiting the total amount of data available at
   Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET, formerly INM). The new MOPREDAS
   (monthly precipitation database of Spain) database has been constructed
   by using all 6821 original data series that have been recorded for at
   least 10 years. These provide a total of 2670 complete, homogeneous
   series for the period 1946-2005, and are the most complete and extensive
   monthly precipitation dataset available in Spain at present. MOPREDAS
   has been created with the aim of analysing the behaviour of
   precipitation in the conterminous provinces of Spain, and to help
   validate the downscaling of climate models on a detailed spatial level.
   To this end, the station data were also interpolated on a regular grid,
   at 1/10 of degree of resolution, over the whole Spain.
   Trend analysis confirms great spatial and temporal variability in the
   behaviour of precipitation across Spain. The monthly precipitation
   trends vary from month to month, from coherent spatial trend patterns in
   March, June (both with a general and significant negative trend) and
   October (general positive trends), to highly regionalized trend patterns
   in July (with positive trends in north-west and mainly negative in the
   remainder), February and April (positive and negative trends in the
   south-east, respectively). These results suggest that both global and
   local factors affect the spatial distribution of trends in the Iberian
   Peninsula. Mountain ranges seem to be the most significant geographical
   factor in determining the spatial distribution of monthly trends on a
   detailed, sub-regional spatial scale. These results show that it is
   possible to accurately delineate the areas affected by different
   precipitation trends if a dense spatial database is available. Copyright

Abstract = {The present study analyzes the observed extreme precipitation based on
   the daily precipitation records of 49 ground stations across Iran from
   1980 to 2019. The present study aims to investigate the frequency,
   intensity, and trend of precipitation extremes in different climate
   zones. We computed the new extreme precipitation indices (EPI)
   recommended by the Expert Team on Sector-Specific Climate Indices
   (ET-SCI) and used two nonparametric tests, the modified Mann-Kendall
   (MM-K) test and Sen slope estimator (SSE), to identify the trend
   magnitude. Also, we applied the Buishand test for detecting the
   potential change-point of EPIs in Iran. The results showed that the
   consecutive wet days (CWD) are decreasing at 73.47\% of the stations in
   Iran. The annual sum of precipitation in wet days (PRCPTOT) index in
   87.76\% of Iran showed a decreasing trend, indicating severe drought
   conditions in Iran. The simple daily intensity index (SDII) in 71.42\%
   (30.23\% at the level of 0.05 significance) has an increasing trend. The
   heavy precipitation index (R10mm) showed a decreasing trend in all
   zones. The most frequent change-point of extreme precipitation occurred
   in 1997 and 1998 on Iran's west, southeast, and southern coasts.
   Increasing the intensity of precipitation along with decreasing in
   precipitation frequency has caused the increased contribution of extreme
   precipitation to the total annual precipitation in Iran.},

Abstract = {Climatic characteristics of occurrence of extreine rainfall events over
   central India are studied by using about 100 years of daily rainfall
   data. The time series comprising of daily rainfall data set 350 stations
   in the Central parts of India (comprising of the states Madhya Pradesh,
   Chattisgarh and Vidarbha) for the period 1901 2010 have been analysed.
   The daily rainfall (rf) has been classified under the categories of (i)
   7< rf < 12 cm, (ii) rf 12 cm. and (iii) annual extreme (24 hourly
   rainfall) and their events, patterns and significance have been
   examined. It is seen that. the long-term does not indicate any trend in
   the monsoon seasonal (June to September) rainfall; however there are
   decreasing and increasing trends in the extreme rainfall(>= 7cm) events.
   The composite charts of frequency of occurrence of extreme rainfall
   events located in various geographical areas have been prepared and
   thereby identifying the possible highest rainfall areas over central
   India. The synoptic weather systems responsible for the extreme events
   over central India were also examined-and discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Using a variety of trend extraction techniques applied to monthly
   observations from 1766 to 2002 on the EWP dataset.. this study confirms
   that there is evidence of a trend towards wetter winters (November to
   March), particularly in December and january, and drier summers,
   although this feature appears to be concentrated in june and july. Trend
   precipitation in autumn (August to November) is more difficult to pin
   down, with alternative methods producing quite different trend patterns,
   thus highlighting how difficult it can be to extract trends from noisy
   data. In general, the results appear to be reasonably consistent with
   those of Alexander \& Jones (2001) using rather different techniques,
   thus lending weight to the views expressed by them.},

Title = {The roles of convective and stratiform precipitation in the observed

Abstract = {Northwest China is one of the most arid areas in East Asia. Previous
   studies pointed out that some regions of Northwest China experienced a
   dry to wet climate change in the past half century. This study analyzed
   the observed daily precipitation during 1961-2000 in Northwest China.
   Results show that the annual precipitation in Northwest China has
   different trends in the western region and the eastern region. The
   western region has a significant increasing trend as shown in previous
   studies, while the eastern region has a decreasing trend. It is found
   that the increasing trend in the western region is caused by the
   increase of the heaviest precipitation in summer, while the decreasing
   trend in the eastern region is caused by the decrease of the heaviest
   precipitation in autumn. In order to find out the dominating
   precipitation type in the change of precipitation, a simple parameter is
   used to distinguish convective precipitation from stratiform
   precipitation. It is found that the increase of the heaviest
   precipitation in summer in the western region resulted from the
   increased frequency of convective precipitation, and the decrease of the
   heaviest precipitation in autumn in the eastern region was caused by the
   decreased frequency of stratiform precipitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Precipitation data for Seoul, Korea, have been recorded since 1778,
   representing one of the world's longest instrumental measurements of
   daily precipitation. Trends in summer precipitation amount, intensity,
   and indices of climate extremes are studied. The detected trends were
   tested using trend-to-noise ratio test, nonparametric Mann-Kendall rank
   statistic and Monte Carlo simulation procedure. Over the past 227 years
   and in the twentieth century, the June-September total precipitation
   amount has a trend significant at 95\% confidence level; the numbers of
   torrential rainy days with precipitation greater than 75 mm, the highest
   one-day rainfall amount, the number of extremely wet days defined as the
   99 percentile of the distribution of daily precipitation, and the
   precipitation amount falling in the extremely wet days, all have a trend
   significant at 99\% confidence level. An intensity index that captures
   the combined effects of precipitation frequency and intensity,
   calculated as the number of heaviest rainy days that constitute 67\% of
   the total precipitation shows a decreasing trend significant at 99\%
   confidence level, suggesting an increase in precipitation intensity.
   However, the trends calculated for the pre-1950 period (1778-1949) are
   all insignificant except the intensity index, suggesting that real
   trends occur only in the recent 55 years. Nevertheless, the pronounced
   recent increasing trends since 1950 are unprecedented. What give rise
   this trend remain elusive.},

Title = {Robust trend estimation of observed German precipitation},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {93},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {107-115},

Abstract = {Trends in climate time series are habitually estimated on the basis of
   the least-squares method. This estimator is optimal if the residuals
   follow the Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, only a small number of
   observed climate time series fulfil this assumption. This work
   introduces a robust method for trend analyses of non-Gaussian climate
   variables. Robust trend analyses as well as probability assessments of
   extreme events (Tromel and Schonwiese 2006) represent an application of
   the generalized time series decomposition technique. Tromel (2005) and
   Tromel and Schonwiese (2005) applied this decomposition technique to
   monthly precipitation sums from a German station network of 132 time
   series covering 1901-2000 in order to achieve a statistical modeling of
   the time series. The time series under consideration can be interpreted
   as a realization of a Gumbel-distributed random variable with
   time-dependent scale and location parameter. More precisely, each
   observed value can be seen as one possible realization of the estimated
   probability density function (PDF) with the location and the scale
   parameter of the respective time step. Consequently, the expected value
   of the Gumbel-distributed random variable can be estimated for every
   time step of the observation period and the statistical modeling
   represents an alternative approach to estimate trends in observational
   precipitation time series. The method is robust with respect to observed
   high precipitation values. The influence of relatively high
   precipitation sums is not larger than justified from a statistical point
   of view and changes in all parameters (here location and scale
   parameter) of the distribution can be taken into account.
   Monte-Carlo-simulations demonstrate the smaller mean squared error of
   the trend estimator using the statistical modeling. The least-squares
   estimator often shows a positive bias, while the method introduced
   provides robust monthly trend estimates taken into account the
   statistical characteristics of precipitation.},

Abstract = {According to the latest climate change predictions and based on
   historical meteorological data, the south-eastern part of Romania is the
   most vulnerable area in Romania and one of the most prone area in Europe
   to the adverse effects of climate change and desertification. In this
   context, this study was focused on analyzing trends and variability of
   annual and seasonal air mean temperatures and precipitation amounts
   based on relevant time series (1961-2015 period) related to five
   representative meteorological stations (Calarasi, Galati, Tulcea, Sulina
   si Constanta) located in the study area. In order to perform this study,
   the MAKESENS application (Mann-Kendall test for trend and Sen's slope
   estimator) was used. The main results showed an increase of mean air
   temperature, especially in the summer season, being consistent with the
   current global warming. On the other hand, statistically irrelevant
   changes in precipitation trends were noted. Nevertheless, an increase in
   extreme events, like heavy rainfall and rainfall intensity, is expected,
   which will have negative effects both on socio-economic and
   environmental sector. In this context, through early considering and
   applying the most appropriate risk mitigation measures the adaptation to
   climate change and desertification will be easier.},

Abstract = {This work analyses the trend of annual precipitation in Aragon during
   the second half of the tentieth century, the spatial differences that
   this trend might entail in the Autonomous Community, both on an annual
   and a seasonal scale and the impact on water resources and their
   management. The regional series (1950-2000) presents drier and more
   humid phases and a slight negative trend which is not significant from
   the sixties onwards. The Zaragoza, Huesca and Teruel observatories
   follow a similar evolution. As regards to space, no significant trends
   can be observed in the annual totals of any Aragonese county; but
   instead on a seasonal scale there are some differences: winter shows a
   precipitation decreasing gradient from south-easat to north-west,
   opposite to the one produced in summer. Autumn has a clear north-south
   decreasing gradient, whereas spring does not offer clearly defined
   patterns. To be able to face the possible adverse effects coming from
   the rainfall decrease, efficient water policy actions are in need of a
   high degree of planning and rational water management.},

Abstract = {With global warming, precipitation events are often prone to intensify
   in some regions. Understanding the changing characteristics of annual
   and daily extreme precipitation as well as the underlying mechanisms
   plays an import role for early warning of precipitation-induced disaster
   (e.g. floods, landslides) and water resources management, especially in
   densely populated urban areas. In this study, we investigate the
   long-term trend of annual and daily extreme precipitation in China
   during 1960-2010 based on daily observations from 539 meteorological
   stations, and the land cover map with impervious information. We find an
   overall increasing trend in annual and daily extreme precipitation,
   particularly in South-East and North-West of China. Moreover, 157
   stations located in metropolitan regions experience higher increasing
   trends of daily extreme precipitation, particularly in Shanghai and
   Guangzhou metropolitan areas. It is noted that the central urban area of
   one metropolitan region may have significantly higher increasing trends
   of daily extreme precipitation than corresponding surrounding areas.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the changing climate, the frequency and intensity of extreme
   precipitation events are increasing. Climate change is projected to
   increase both mean and extreme precipitation. Socio-economic damages can
   be immense and require a difficult recovery, especially for developing
   countries such as Bhutan. Furthermore, changing precipitation patterns
   affect land productivity and water availability. The Experts Team on
   Climate Change Detection Indices (ETCCDI) is used to find the changes
   associated with extreme precipitation in Bhutan. The study of extreme
   precipitation is important for Bhutan, whose economy is dependent on
   agriculture and hydropower. Even for a small country, there were varying
   patterns of precipitation in different districts. Deothang district
   received less frequent and more intense rainfall, while Haa, Bumthang,
   Trashiyangtse, and Chukha received weak but persistent rainfall.
   Mann-Kendall trends revealed a drier climate for two districts, Dagana
   and Trashiyangtse, and a wetter climate for the Mongar district.
   Modeling of the extreme rainfall with extreme value theory (EVT)
   revealed that the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution by their
   T = 50-year return value, indicating an increasing value of annual
   maximums for all stations. This study is the first of its kind for
   Bhutan, and the findings can be used for decision support and the
   planning of appropriate adaptation strategies for hydro-meteorological
   disasters, hydropower, and agriculture sectors in Bhutan.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean Basin is a region where global climate change will be
   most evident. Located in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, Turkey is a
   potential area of risk, too. Climate change will significantly affect
   the high precipitation variability in the Mediterranean Basin. This
   study used seasonal and annual precipitation data from 1975-2008 from 83
   meteorology stations to identify the precipitation trends in Turkey.
   Seasonal and annual precipitation analysis is performed with two types
   of statistical analyses. First, the presence of a monotonic increasing
   or decreasing trend is tested with the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test
   and, secondly, the slope of a linear trend is estimated with the
   nonparametric Sen's method. These analyses revealed a decreasing trend
   in all seasonal and annual precipitation other than those in autumn,
   during which an increasing trend prevails throughout the country. While
   the northern coast of Turkey seems to have an increased precipitation
   trend other than in summer, a decrease can be observed in southern and
   central regions. The overall semi-arid qualities of these regions where
   precipitation rates fall call for a sustainable irrigation management.},

   Number of wet days, defined by a day with at least 1 mm of

   precipitation intensity of wet days shows an increasing trend. Heavy
   precipitation indices, which are defined by precipitation amount and
   percentile, demonstrate that the number of stations with significant
   upward trend is larger than that with significant downward trend. Heavy
   precipitation increases in southern Vietnam, northern part of Myanmar,
   and the Visayas and Luzon Islands in the Philippines, while heavy
   precipitation decreases in northern Vietnam. Annual maximum number of
   consecutive dry days decreases in the region where winter monsoon
   precipitation dominates. Decrease of precipitation event in the dry

Journal = {CLIMATE SERVICES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {34},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper presents the Interactive Digital Climate Atlas of the Canary
   Islands, a web portal based on geographic information systems for the
   dissemination of climate information. It provides citizens and public
   and private administrations with high spatial resolution maps (100 m) of
   different climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, relative
   humidity, cloudiness frequency and wind velocity. Also available are
   Ko<spacing diaeresis>ppen climate classification maps and decadal trends
   of temperature and precipitation in a context of climate change. This
   spatial resolution is suitable for the detailed climatic description of
   small and orographically complex islands. For this purpose, climate
   series from databases of different public institutions as well as data
   from remote sensing and reanalysis systems were employed. A statistical
   process involving data filtering and the detection and correction of
   inhomogeneous segments was carried out as a preparatory step. Then, a
   spatial interpolation model was developed using a multiple linear
   regression method for the generation of the high spatial resolution
   climate cartography. The results are annual and monthly maps of the
   climate variables in Canary Islands at 100 m spatial resolution and with
   different time periods depending on the availability of data on the
   different variables, but in most cases between 1991 and 2020. Following
   the European Directive INSPIRE (Directive 2007/2/CE, Infrastructure for
   Spatial Information in Europe), both map visualisation and downloading
   in GeoTIFF and NetCDF format are permitted, as well as consultation of
   the data and metadata of the climatic series used.},

Title = {Sorghum farmers' perceptions of climate change, its effects, temperature

Abstract = {Climate change is causing significant damage to crop production in the
   central plateau zone of Rwanda, particularly affecting sorghum, food,
   and the incomes of smallholder farmers. Understanding farmers'
   perceptions and the factors impacting their responses is crucial for
   improving sorghum production policies and programs. Therefore, a study
   was conducted to assess sorghum farmers' perceptions of climate change
   and the factors determining their adaptation strategies. A multistage
   sampling method and a cluster random selection were utilized to select
   345 respondents from five districts of the study area. The data were
   analyzed using descriptive statistics and a multivariate probit model.
   The results showed that 98.8\% of farmers were aware of climate change,
   with deforestation being the main anthropogenic activity causing it.
   Consequently, 95.7\% and 84.3\% of farmers experienced grain yield
   reductions, and over 20 sorghum varieties disappeared. To address these
   impacts, farmers adopted five adaptation strategies: early maturing
   sorghum varieties (67\%), adjusting planting dates (50.1\%),
   drought-tolerant varieties (46.7\%), soil conservation practices
   (38.3\%), and crop diversification (32.8\%). The multivariate probit
   model results showed the age and literacy level of the household head,
   access to extension services, access to information, access to credit,
   farming experience, and land size as the important factors influencing
   at least one of the climate change adaptation strategies. The study
   concluded that sorghum farmers are aware of the impacts of climate
   change and are acting to address its negative effects. The results
   suggest that the government and stakeholders should support farmers in
   strengthening their adaptation strategies for sustainable sorghum
   production.},

   weather evolution and its prediction. In order to evaluate the
   precipitation variability in Dobrudja the annual and monthly
   precipitation series collected from 1965 to 2005, at ten meteorological
   stations have been studied. Two types of models for the trend have been
   designed, for the groups of precipitation series formed after the
   variance analysis, using a version of wavelets technique and smoothing
   splines, proposed by us. The results comparison has also been provided.

Abstract = {Precipitation variability has direct and serious impacts on society. In
   this study, the latitudinal precipitation characteristics and trends in

   increasing precipitation trends over high latitudes, and no significant
   trends over lower latitudes. The spatial display of the observed trends
   is also shown to understand the significant variation and shift of
   monsoon rainfall in the specific areas. This study not only provides
   important information on precipitation variability in Pakistan, but is
   also helpful for policy makers seeking to adopt measures to mitigate the
   effects of rapidly changing climate in the vulnerable areas. (C) 2013

Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Savannas comprise a major component of the Earth system and contribute
   ecosystem services and functions essential to human livelihoods.
   Monitoring spatial and temporal trends in savanna vegetation and
   understanding change drivers is therefore crucial. Widespread greening
   has been identified across southern Africa; yet its drivers and
   manifestations on the ground remain ambiguous. This study removes the
   effects of precipitation on an NDVI time-series, thereby identifying
   trends not driven by rainfall. It utilizes the significant correlation
   between vegetation and precipitation as captured using MODIS and
   rainfall estimates. A linear regression between variables was used to
   derive its residual (corrected) time-series, and the rate and spatial
   extent of trends were evaluated in relation to biomes. A random
   sample-based qualitative interpretation of high spatial resolution
   imagery was then used to evaluate the nature of the trend on the ground.
   23.25\% of the country, including all biomes exhibited positive trends.
   We propose that greening may be related to a reduction in woody species
   richness, loss of the large trees and a shift towards drought tolerant
   shrub species, as has been shown in other sub-Saharan environments.
   3.23\% of the country exhibited negative trends, which were mostly
   associated with more humid (forested) regions pointing to deforestation
   as a cause; these manifested as vegetation clearing, identifiable using
   high resolution multi-temporal imagery. Greening trends could not be
   identified using this approach; instead, they point to the occurrence of
   gradual vegetation change caused by indirect drivers. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between normalized vegetation index
   (NDVI) response to rainfall and temperature conditions by analyzing the
   spatial and temporal variation of vegetation cover (NDVI) in Mu Us
   Desert during 2000-2019. Based on MODIS remote sensing data, the NDVI of
   Mu Us Desert sandy land from 2000 to 2019 was analyzed by using the
   linear regression slope method. In 2000-2010 and 2010-2019, there was a
   difference in the change rate of vegetation index in Mu Us Desert, with
   the average slope of 0.0650/10a for the former and 0.0782/10a for the
   latter. In the northwestern and central parts of the Muus Desert,
   vegetation cover changed less, and the area of the study area with a
   significant decrease in vegetation cover was very sparse. The trends of
   NDVI values in the study area during 2000-2019 were roughly the same as
   those of precipitation, and slightly different from those of
   temperature, but the overall correlation between NDVI values and both
   was good. There is a significant positive correlation between NDVI and
   annual precipitation (0.687), and a weak correlation with temperature
   (0.264). The vegetation growth in Mu Us Desert is affected by both
   rainfall and temperature.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Precipitation and streamflow trends may be changing due to changing
   climate. Therefore, data for these in the state of Michigan, USA, are
   examined through the use of statistical methods. Data from 117
   precipitation stations were used, along with data from 143 streamflow
   gages. Data time periods varied among the stations with the longest
   record dating back to 1901. These methods include the linear regression
   best-fit line for the whole data set and also for before and after a
   two-sample change point analysis, moving mean, and moving standard
   deviation. It was found that mean precipitation for 90\% of the
   locations and mean streamflow for 76\% of the locations increased over
   the period of record. The moving standard deviation for precipitation
   increased for 54\% of the locations, while 28\% of the streamflow
   locations had an increase. Values of precipitation P(T <= t) two-tail,
   precipitation linear regression slope, and streamflow P(T <= t) two-tail
   at a 0.05 significance level occur in concentrated regions. 97\% of the
   precipitation data sets and 92\% of the streamflow data sets exhibited a
   distinct change. These results have implications for future management
   of flood control, recreation, water supply, and irrigation.},

Abstract = {In climate change research, it is vital knowledge about future changes
   in the trends of climatological time series. The purpose of this study
   is to look at the effect of seasonality on the trend and long-term
   persistence of precipitation and temperature time series in the Konya
   Endorheic basin, a semi-arid basin in central Anatolia, Turkey.
   Seasonal-Trend Decomposition by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing
   was used to obtain a seasonality adjusted time series, and a comparative
   analysis with the original series was performed. The Mann-Kendall (MK)
   test and simple linear slope were used to determine monotonic trends. To
   observe long-term persistence, Hurst exponents were computed using the
   eescaled range analysis approach. The Onyutha trend test was then used
   to investigate the sub-trends. As a result, there is a significant
   increase in temperature. Precipitation is increasing in the west and
   east of the basin while decreasing in the north and south. The magnitude
   of the monotonic and sub-trend is enhanced by seasonal adjustment.
   Meanwhile, in the seasonally adjusted dataset, the Hurst exponent grew
   dramatically, reinforcing the long-term persistence. Seasonality has
   less of an impact on precipitation, which is more affected by local
   variability, than temperature.},

Title = {Daily extreme precipitation and trends over China},
Journal = {SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2190-2203},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Based on daily precipitation data of more than 2000 Chinese stations and
   more than 50 yr, we constructed time series of extreme precipitation
   based on six different indices for each station: annual and summer
   maximum (top-1) precipitation, accumulated amount of 10 precipitation
   maxima (annual, summer; top-10), and total annual and summer
   precipitation. Furthermore, we constructed the time series of the total
   number of stations based on the total number of stations with top-1 and
   top-10 annual extreme precipitation for the whole data period, the whole
   country, and six subregions, respectively. Analysis of these time series
   indicate three regions with distinct trends of extreme precipitation:
   (1) a positive trend region in Southeast China, (2) a positive trend
   region in Northwest China, and (3) a negative trend region in North
   China. Increasing (decreasing) ratios of 10-30\% or even > 30\% were
   observed in these three regions. The national total number of stations
   with top-1 and top-10 precipitation extremes increased respectively by
   2.4 and 15 stations per decade on average but with great inter-annual
   variations. There have been three periods with highly frequent
   precipitation extremes since 1960: (1) early 1960s, (2) middle and late
   1990s, and (3) early 21st century. There are significant regional
   differences in trends of regional total number of stations with top-1
   and top-10 precipitation. The most significant increase was observed
   over Northwest China. During the same period, there are significant
   changes in the atmospheric variables that favor the decrease of extreme
   precipitation over North China: an increase in the geopotential height
   over North China and its upstream regions, a decrease in the low-level
   meridional wind from South China coast to North China, and the
   corresponding low moisture content in North China. The extreme
   precipitation values with a 50-year empirical return period are 400-600
   mm at the South China coastal regions and gradually decrease to less
   than 50 mm in Northwest China. The mean increase rate in comparison with
   20-year empirical return levels is 6.8\%. The historical maximum
   precipitation is more than twice the 50-year return levels.},

Title = {Trend Analyses of Extreme Precipitation Events in the Yarlung Zangbo
   River Basin, China Using a High-Resolution Precipitation Product},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB) is an important transboundary
   river basin in Tibet, China with south Asian countries. Changes in
   precipitation are important driving factors of river flow changes.
   Extreme Precipitation Events (EPE), in particular, have serious impacts
   on human life and sustainable development. The objective of this study
   is to explore the temporal changes and the spatial distribution of EPE
   over the YZRB in recent decades using a precipitation product with a 5
   km spatial resolution and the Mann-Kendall nonparametric statistical
   test method. A more thorough understanding of the spatial heterogeneity
   in precipitation was expected from using this high resolution dataset.
   At both basin and pixel scale, both annual precipitation amounts and
   number of rain days had significant upward trends, indicating that the
   increase in the number of rain days is one possible cause of the annual
   precipitation amounts increases. The annual precipitation and number of
   rain days increased significantly in 50.8\% and 75.8\% of the basin
   area, respectively. The areas showing upward trends for the two indexes
   mostly overlapped, supporting the hypothesis that the increasing number
   of rain days is one possible cause of the increases in annual
   precipitation in these areas. General precipitation intensity and EPE
   intensity increased in the Lhasa regions and in the southern part of the
   lower-reach region. However, the intensity of general precipitation and
   EPE decreased in the Nyangqu River Basin. A total of 43.0\% of the area
   in the YZRB exhibits significant upward trends in EPE frequency. The
   contributions of EPE to total rainfall increase significantly in the
   Lhasa and Shannan regions. Overall, it was shown that the risk of
   disasters from EPE in the YZRB increases in the eastern middle-reach
   region and southern lower-reach region.},

Abstract = {Using daily precipitation records from 151 stations, the Mann-Kendall
   nonparametric test, and the rotated empirical orthogonal function, this
   study examined trends in precipitation and precipitation extremes and
   underlying mechanisms in the U.S. Great Basin during 1951-2013. The
   results indicate that annual total precipitation, 1 day and 5 day
   maximum precipitation, extreme precipitation days over the 95th and 99th
   percentiles trended upward during 1951-2013. Spatially, stations
   experienced significant positive trends in six indices are mostly
   distributed in the eastern basin, while those experienced significant
   negative trends are a few and situated in the western basin. Four
   distinct modes characterized by different patterns of annual
   precipitation variations were identified. They are the northeastern,
   southern, midwestern, and midnorthern modes. In addition, we found that
   the effects of El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation on precipitation was low in the basin. The intensifying
   high-pressure system over the western North Pacific in winter and the
   increasing water vapor and air temperature of the atmosphere over the
   basin in winter and spring were mainly responsible for the upward trends
   in six indices during 1951-2013. Nevertheless, the topography regulates
   the effects of synoptic conditions on precipitation, contributing to the
   ``east-west{''} contrast in station distribution between those
   experienced negative and positive trends. Overall, precipitation and
   precipitation extremes increased significantly in the eastern and
   northern basin while increases were not significant in the western and
   southern basin. This information has important implications for not only
   predicting future precipitation changes but also mitigating
   precipitation-change-associated risks on ecosystems and human society in
   the Great Basin.},

Abstract = {Analysis of precipitation trends as well as the observed trends in
   precipitation concentration can be useful tools for the identification
   of natural hazards. This study aimed to analyze the trends in
   precipitation and precipitation concentration at the seasonal and annual
   levels in Mexico from 1960 to 2010. To do this, an entropy-based
   concentration index was used to calculate the concentration of
   precipitation at 44 climatological stations distributed throughout the
   country. The trend analysis was developed based on the Mann-Kendall
   test. There were fifteen significant precipitation trends at the annual
   level, and the numbers of positive and negative trends were nearly even.
   The interannual average of the concentration index ranged from 0.084 to
   0.265, although extreme values of up to 0.56 were observed at the annual
   level and of up to 1 at the seasonal level. There were more positive
   trends than negative trends in the concentration index. The comparison
   of the trends of the precipitation and the concentration index showed an
   increase in precipitation at some stations with an associated decrease
   in the concentration index. On the other hand, decreases in
   precipitation at other stations were accompanied by increases in the
   concentration index. The first case did not seem to represent risk
   because the conditions suggested a more regular precipitation pattern.
   However, the second case could be considered a cautionary indicator,
   especially in the northern region, where it could signal the potential
   for drought.},

Abstract = {Based on daily precipitation measurements from 271 meteorological
   stations in northern China during 1960-2011, we found that precipitation
   amount did not show significant trend (p=0.25). To obtain a better
   understanding of regional precipitation differences, we divided northern
   China into two regions and five sub-regions. A wetting tendency was
   identified for the northwestern of China (NW), while a drying tendency
   was determined for the northeastern of China (NE). Precipitation
   tendencies also displayed regional differences. We determined that
   changes in precipitation frequency dominated changes in precipitation
   amount for low altitude areas, while changes in precipitation intensity
   were the main cause of changes in precipitation amount in high altitude
   areas. Both precipitation frequency and intensity had an equivalent
   impact on changes within middle altitude regions of the NW. In contrast,
   changes in precipitation amount within the NE were mainly caused by
   precipitation frequency. The effect of precipitation intensity on
   precipitation amount was not significant. For all of the sub-regions
   investigated, heavy precipitation contributed the most to changes in
   total precipitation amount. The results obtained from this study will be
   of value to those studying the response of northern Chinese ecosystems
   to climate change.},

Abstract = {Due to their substantial spatio-temporal behavior, long-term
   quantification and analyses of important hydrological variables are
   essential for practical applications in water resources planning,
   evaluating the water use of agricultural crop production and quantifying
   crop evapotranspiration patterns and irrigation management vs.
   hydrologic balance relationships. Observed data at over 800 sites across
   the Great Plains of USA, comprising of 9 states and 2,307,410 km(2) of
   surface area, which is about 30\% of the terrestrial area of the USA,
   were used to quantify and map large-scale and long-term (1968-2013)
   spatial trends of air temperatures, daily temperature range (DTR),
   precipitation, grass-reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and aridity
   index (AI) at monthly, growing season and annual time steps. Air
   temperatures had a strong north to south increasing trend, with annual
   average varying from - 1 to 24 degrees C, and growing season average
   temperature varying from 8 to 30 degrees C. DTR gradually decreased from
   western to eastern parts of the region, with a regional annual and
   growing season averages of 14.25 degrees C and 14.79 degrees C,
   respectively. Precipitation had a gradual shift towards higher
   magnitudes from west to east, with the average annual and growing season
   (May-September) precipitation ranging from 163 to 1486 mm and from 98 to
   746 mm, respectively. ETo had a southwest-northeast decreasing trend,
   with regional annual and growing season averages of 1297 mm and 823 mm,
   respectively. AI increased from west to east, indicating higher humidity
   (less arid) towards the east, with regional annual and growing season
   averages of 0.49 and 0.44, respectively. The spatial datasets and maps
   for these important climate variables can serve as valuable background
   for climate change and hydrologic studies in the Great Plains region.
   Through identification of priority areas from the developed maps,
   efforts of the concerned personnel and agencies and resources can be
   diverted towards development of holistic strategies to address water
   supply and demand challenges under changing climate. These strategies
   can consist of, but not limited to, advancing water, crop and soil
   management, and genetic improvements and their relationships with the
   climatic variables on large scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Detection of long-term changes in climate variables over large spatial
   scales is a very important prerequisite to the development of effective
   mitigation and adaptation measures for the future potential climate
   change and for developing strategies for future hydrologic balance
   analyses under changing climate. Moreover, there is a need for effective
   approaches of providing information about these changes to decision
   makers, water managers and stakeholders to aid in efficient
   implementation of the developed strategies. This study involves
   computation, mapping and analyses of long-term (1968-2013)
   county-specific trends in annual, growing-season (1st May-30th
   September) and monthly air temperatures {[}(maximum (T-max), minimum
   (T-min) and average (T-avg)], daily temperature range (DTR),
   precipitation, grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and aridity
   index (AI) over the USA Great Plains region using datasets from over 800
   weather station sites. Positive trends in annual Tan, Tmax and Tmin,
   DTR, precipitation, ET,, and AI were observed in 71\%, 89\%, 85\%, 31\%,
   61\%, 38\% and 66\% of the counties in the region, respectively, whereas
   these proportions were 48\%, 89\%, 62\%, 20\%, 57\%, 28\%, and 63\%,
   respectively, for the growing-season averages of the same variables. On
   a regional average basis, the positive trends in growing-season T-avg,
   T-max and T-min, DTR, precipitation, ETo and AI were 0.18 degrees C
   decade(-1), 0.19 degrees C decade(-1), 0.17 degrees C decade(-1), 0.09
   degrees C decade(-1), 1.12 mm yr(-1), 0.4 mm yr(-1) and 0.02 decade(-1),

   decade(-1), 1.16 mm yr(-1), 0.76 mm yr(-1) and 0.02 decade(-1),
   respectively. The temporal trends were highly variable in space and were
   appropriately represented using monthly, annual and growing-season maps
   developed using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The
   long-term and spatial and temporal information and data for a large

   average period spanning 2006 to 2015), near-future conditions (an
   average period spanning 2026 to 2035), and future conditions (an average
   period spanning 2046 to 2055). Climate indices were computed with
   bias-corrected EURO-CORDEX model ensembles from two Representative
   Concentration Pathway scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The systematic error
   was reduced using the quantile mapping method with a non-parametric
   approach of robust empirical quantiles (RQUANT). Data were used as
   references in the period of current climate conditions, and those
   required for bias correction consisted of historical ground-based
   observations provided by the Institute of Meteorology and Water
   Management. The analysis encompassed various key climate indices,
   including the annual average temperature, the count of hot days, cold
   days, and frost days, the cumulative annual precipitation, the frequency
   of days with precipitation, and instances of extreme precipitation
   (defined as the days with precipitation exceeding 10 mm/day). These
   findings reveal a noteworthy rise in the average annual temperature of
   approximately 1 degrees C and an uptick in the number of hot days by 3.7
   days. Conversely, a decline in the number of cold days by approximately
   19 days and frost days by 8 days was observed. Additionally, there was
   an augmentation in the annual precipitation sum, reaching up to 80 mm in
   RCP 8.5, accompanied by an increase in the number of days with
   precipitation (up by 3.3 days) and days with extreme precipitation (up
   by 2 days).},

Abstract = {In the present work meteorological data, concerning temperature and
   precipitation in a mountainous Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis
   Mattf.) forest, was analyzed in order to find trends for the period
   1973-2019. The results showed that temperature values on annual and
   seasonal base, especially in summers, showed a significant increasing
   trend. In addition, the number of days with particularly high
   temperatures increased together with the daily temperature range. With
   regard to the rain height an increasing trend was found significant at
   the 0.1 probability level. The nitrogen concentration in current year
   needles of the Bulgarian fir measured in the period 1997-2019 showed an
   increasing trend. This fact could be a sign of increased mineralization
   rates of organic matter as a response to the temperature increase.},

Title = {Trends in Persistent Seasonal-Scale Atmospheric Circulation Patterns
   Responsible for Seasonal Precipitation Totals and Occurrences of

Abstract = {Both large-scale atmospheric circulation and moisture content in the
   atmosphere govern regional precipitation. We partition recent changes in
   mean, heavy, and extreme precipitation for all seasons over Canada to
   changes in synoptic circulation patterns (dynamic changes) and in
   atmospheric moisture conditions (thermodynamic changes) using 500-hPa
   geopotential height and precipitation data over 1979-2014. Using the
   self-organizing map (SOM) cluster analysis, we identify statistically
   significant trends in occurrences of certain synoptic circulation
   patterns over the Canadian landmass, which have dynamically contributed
   to observed changes in precipitation totals and occurrence of heavy and
   extreme precipitation events over Canada. Occurrences of circulation
   patterns such as westerlies and ridges over western North America and
   the North Pacific have considerably affected regional precipitation over
   Canada. Precipitation intensity and occurrences of precipitation
   extremes associated with each SOM circulation pattern also showed
   statistically significant trends resulting from thermodynamic changes in
   the atmospheric moisture supply for precipitation events. A partition
   analysis based on the thermodynamic-dynamic partition method indicates
   that most (similar to 90\%) changes in mean and extreme precipitation
   over Canada resulted from changes in precipitation regimes occurring
   under each synoptic circulation pattern (thermodynamic changes). Other
   regional precipitation changes resulted from changes in occurrences of
   synoptic circulation patterns (dynamic changes). Because of the high
   spatial variability of precipitation response to changes in
   thermodynamic and dynamic conditions, dynamic contributions could offset
   thermodynamic contributions to precipitation changes over some regions
   if thermodynamic and dynamic contributions are in opposition to each
   other (negative or positive), which would result in minimal changes in
   precipitation intensity and occurrences of heavy and extreme
   precipitation events.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of precipitation changes in the main
   Hydrological Divisions (HDs; `Cuencas Hidrograficas', Water Planning
   Divisions) in Spain from 1946-2005. Trend analysis revealed several
   monthly long-term variations and important spatial differences that
   should be taken into account for any national water-planning scheme. The
   most spatially coherent signals were a negative trend observed in March
   and June, affecting all catchments (HDs), and a positive trend in
   October, which was particularly evident in the northwestern catchments.
   These caused a redistribution of precipitation throughout the year, with
   a reduction in the length of the wet season (due to the negative trend
   in March) and a concentration of precipitation at the beginning of the
   wet season in October. A running trend analysis revealed variability in
   the long-term tendency which, although quite persistent, changed in
   strength between sub-periods.},

Abstract = {Observed changes in intense precipitation (e.g., the frequency of very
   heavy precipitation or the upper 0.3\% of daily precipitation events)
   have been analyzed for over half of the land area of the globe. These
   changes have been linked to changes in intense precipitation for three
   transient climate model simulations. all with greenhouse gas
   concentrations increasing during the twentieth and twenty-first
   centuries and doubling in the later part of the twenty-first century. It
   was found that both the empirical evidence from the period of
   instrumental observations and model projections of a greenhouse-enriched
   atmosphere indicate an increasing probability of intense precipitation
   events for many extratropical regions including the United States.
   Although there can be ambiguity as to the impact of more frequent heavy
   precipitation events, the thresholds of the definitions of these events
   were raised here, such that they are likely to be disruptive.
   Unfortunately, reliable assertions of very heavy and extreme
   precipitation changes are possible only for regions with dense networks
   due to the small radius of correlation for many intense precipitation
   events.},

Abstract = {Drawing from a NOAA database of hourly precipitation data from 5995
   stations in the contiguous United States over the period 1949-2009, the
   authors investigate possible trends in the variance of the hourly
   precipitation, averaged over the diurnal and annual cycles and
   normalized by the square of the mean precipitation at that site. This
   normalized variance is a measure of storminess, distinct from increases
   in precipitation attributable to warming. For the 1722 stations
   surviving quality control with data on at least 80\% of days in at least
   30 years, the authors compute the rate of change of the logarithm of the
   normalized variance at each station and set bounds on its mean (over
   stations) trend. The logarithmic function weights the trends at calm
   stations equally to those at stormy stations and enhances the
   statistical power of the mean. The authors find a logarithmic rate of
   change of the mean normalized variance of (22: 861: 7) 31024 yr 21
   (61s). The 2s upper bounds on any continentally averaged trend,
   increasing or decreasing, are about 0.001 yr 21 (doubling or halving
   times. 1000 years). It is found that the normalized variance in the Los
   Angeles basin has increased at a statistically significant rate. Thismay
   be attributable to a decrease in the number of aerosol condensation
   nuclei. Upper bounds are set on any effect of the 11-yr solar cycle.},

Abstract = {Analysis of trends and projection of precipitation are of significance
   for the future development and management of water resource in southwest
   Iran. This research has been divided into two parts. The first part
   consists of an analysis of the precipitation over 50 stations in the
   study region for the period 1950-2007. The trends in this parameter were
   detected by linear regression and significance was tested by t test.
   Mann-Kendall rank test was also employed to confirm the results. The
   second part of the research involved future projection of precipitation
   based on four models. The models used were Centre National de Recherches
   Meteorologiques (CNRM), European Center Hamburg Model (ECHAM), Model for
   Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROCH) and United Kingdom
   Meteorological Office (UKMOC). Precipitation projections were done under
   B1 and A1B emissions scenarios. The results of precipitation series
   indicated that most stations showed insignificant trend in annual and
   seasonal series. The highest numbers of stations with significant trends
   occurred in winter while no significant trends were detected by
   statistical tests in summer precipitation. No decreasing significant
   trends were detected by statistical tests in annual and seasonal
   precipitation series. The result of projections showed that
   precipitation may decrease according to majority of the models under
   both scenarios but the decrease may not be large, except according to
   MIROCH model. Autumn precipitation may increase with higher rates than
   other seasons at the end of this century.},

Abstract = {For the purpose of detecting the possible long-term trends of Japanese
   precipitation, both parametric t-test And nonparametric Mann-Kendall and
   Mann-Whitney techniques are applied to the spatially averaged
   precipitation time series over Japan. The results indicate that although
   several step changes occurred in Japanese precipitation, the time series
   did not exhibit significant evidence of monotonic trend during the past
   century. When a step change is present, the number of observations
   required for detecting the trend of a given magnitude at a specified
   significance and power level is investigated with the power function of
   the t-test. Results indicate that if the magnitude of the step change
   reaches one or two times of its standard deviation, the previous 50-year
   of record together with 5 years or more of new data will be available
   for detecting the possible trend. This conclusion may be helpful for the
   detection of step changes in the regions where the precipitation has
   near-normal distributions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Revisiting future extreme precipitation trends in the Mediterranean},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Global warming is anticipated to intensify the hydrological cycle.
   However, this is neither expected to be globally uniform nor is the
   relationship between temperature increase and rainfall intensities
   expected to be linear. The objective of this study is to assess changes
   in annual rainfall extremes, total annual precipitation, and their
   relationship in the larger Mediterranean region. We use an up-to-date
   ensemble of 33 regional climate simulations from the EURO-CORDEX
   initiative at 0.11 degrees resolution. We analyse the significance of
   trends for 1951-2000 and 2001-2100 under a `business-as-usual' pathway
   (RCP8.5). Our future projections indicate a strong north/ south
   Mediterranean gradient, with significant, decreasing trends in the
   magnitude of daily precipitation extremes in the south and the Maghreb
   region (up to -10 mm/decade) and less profound, increasing trends in the
   north. Despite the contrasting future trends, the 50-year daily
   precipitation extremes are projected to strongly increase (up to 100\%)
   throughout the region. The 100-year extremes, derived with traditional
   extreme value approaches from the 1951-2000 simulations, underestimate
   the magnitude of these extreme events in the 2001-2100 projections by
   30\% for the drier areas of the Mediterranean (200-500 mm average annual
   rainfall) and by up to 20-30\% for the wetter parts of the region. These
   100-year extremes can occur at any time in any Mediterranean location.
   The contribution of the wettest day per year to the annual total
   precipitation is expected to increase (5-30\%) throughout the region.
   The projected increase in extremes and the strong reductions in mean
   annual precipitation in the drier, southern and eastern Mediterranean
   will amplify the challenges for water resource management.},

Abstract = {We assembled daily precipitation records, initially for 3838 stations,
   throughout India and Ultimately identified 129 stations with reasonably
   complete records over the period 1910 to 2000. From these daily records,
   we generated annual time series of seven different indices of extreme
   precipitation events, including total precipitation, largest 1.5, and 30
   day totals, and the number of daily events above the amount that marks
   the 90th, 95th, and 97.5th percentiles of all precipitation at each
   station. Of the 903 different time series (seven variables for 129
   stations), 114 had a significant upward trend and 61 had a significant
   downward trends overall, 61\% of the time series showed all upward
   trend. The standard regression coefficients showing the strength and
   sign of the trend were highly correlated across the network. They
   generally showed increasing values in a contiguous region extending from
   the northwestern Himalayas in Kashmir through most of the Deccan Plateau
   in the South and decreasing values in the eastern part of the Gangetic
   Plain and parts of Uttaranchal. Our results are in general agreement
   with the prediction from numerical models for an increase in extreme
   precipitation events in India given the ongoing build-up of greenhouse
   gases. Copyright (C) 2004 Royal Meteorolopical Society.},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean region is an area potentially vulnerable to climatic
   changes. In fact, it is characterized by a significant precipitation
   variability resulting from synoptic dynamics of hazardous events moving
   and evolving along the Mediterranean basin. In this paper, the results
   of an investigation on rainfall trend in the Sardinia region are
   presented. The trend analysis has been performed by means of the
   Mann-Kendall test and of the Theil-Sen estimator applied on annual,
   seasonal, and monthly scales. To this aim, a monthly database of
   precipitation registered at 158 rain gauges, with an average observation
   of 84years, was used for the analyses. The results mainly evidenced a
   rainfall amount reduction in the winter months and an increase during
   the summer months. The monthly rainfall distribution throughout the year
   was also investigated by means of the precipitation concentration index
   (PCI). A negative trend emerged and, more specifically, a tendency
   towards a more uniform rainfall distribution on the Sardinia region
   throughout the year.},

Abstract = {Climatic conditions in the Mediterranean area (i.e. long drought periods
   and rainfall concentration in a few storm events) favour soil erosion
   and land degradation. In this area, several studies show that more that
   80\% of soil losses are caused by 5 to 10\% of the rainfall events. The
   temporal and spatial analysis of these high erosivity rainfall events is
   a key factor to evaluate trends in erosion and desertification risk.
   We analysed spatial and temporal trends in the ten annual maximum
   rainfall days from 97 pluviometric stations in the Region of Valencia (E
   Spain) for the normal period 1961-1990.
   The main results are as follows:
   1) The proportion of annual rainfall falling during the day, with
   maximum rainfall increases in 37\% of the stations, and decreases in the
   15\% of the stations.
   2) The proportion of annual rainfall falling when considering all data
   except the 10 days with higher rainfall volume, increases in 13\% of the
   stations, and decreases in 33\% of the stations.
   3) We discuss results in relation to the spatial distribution of the
   stations and to the origin of rainfall events.},

Abstract = {The most expedient means of analysing global climate change is to
   analyse the precipitation along with major components of the global
   atmospheric circulation. Like other Coastal areas, Coastal Andhra is
   also vulnerable to extreme weather events. So, in this study, the trend
   and pattern of the precipitation of the Coastal Andhra have been
   analyzed using daily and monthly rainfall data of 36 years (1983-2018).
   The standardized precipitation index, rainfall anomaly index and
   Mann-Kendall tests have been used to analyse the trend and pattern of
   precipitation. The result showed that the average annual rainfall was
   161 cm in 1983 which first declined to 147 cm in 1991 but increased to
   181 cm in 2001 and again declined rapidly to 91 cm in 2018. Apart from
   this normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been used for the
   years 1983, 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2018 for the validation of dryness and
   wetness. The statistical analysis shows that rainfall in the study area
   shows a declining trend at the rate of - 1.27 cm per year as per the
   result obtained by the Sen, slope. Further, the association between mean
   annual rainfall and NDVI is found to be very strong with a higher
   positive value of the coefficient of determination.},

Title = {Variability of Trends in Precipitation across the Amazon River Basin
   Determined from the <i>CHIRPS</i> Precipitation Product and from Station
   Records},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The Amazon River Basin is the largest rainforest in the world. Long-term
   changes in precipitation trends in the basin can affect the continental
   water balance and the world's climate. The precipitation trends in the
   basin are not spatially uniform; estimating these trends only at
   locations where station data are available has an inherent bias. In the
   present research, the spatially distributed annual precipitation trends
   were studied in the Amazon River Basin from the year 1981 to 2017 using
   the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data
   (CHIRPS) product. The precipitation trends were also cross-validated at
   locations where station data were available. The research also
   identifies clusters within the basin where trends showed a larger
   increase (nine clusters) or decrease in precipitation (10 clusters). The
   overall precipitation trend in the Amazon River Basin over 37 years
   showed a 2.8 mm/year increase, with a maximum of 45.1 mm/year and
   minimum of -37.9 mm/year. The highest positive cluster was in Cuzco in
   the Ucayali River basin, and the lowest negative was in Santa Cruz de la
   Sierra, in the upstream Madeira River basin. The total volume of the
   incoming precipitation was 340,885.1 km(3), with a withdrawal of
   -244,337.1 km(3). Cross-validation was performed using 98 in situ
   stations with more than 20 years of recorded data, obtaining an R-2 of
   0.981, a slope of 1.027, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 363.6
   mm/year. The homogeneous, standardized, and continuous long-term time
   series provided by CHIRPS is a valuable product for basins with a
   low-density network of stations such as the Amazon Basin.},

Abstract = {During the last decades, the variability of the Caribbean precipitation
   has been characterized by dry trends over land. Aiming to gain insights
   into their drivers from an observational perspective, in this study such
   trends are diagnosed in relation to their concomitant low-tropospheric
   circulation by applying linear regressions and Canonical Correlation
   Analysis to different datasets, but particularly using GPCP and ERA5 for
   the 1979-2019 period. During this period, two multidecadal modes of
   natural variability exhibited one-signed trends: the Atlantic
   Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) exhibited a positive trend, and the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) exhibited a negative trend. However,
   as shown by the results, the influence of these large-scale trends
   cannot be directly associated with the dry precipitation trends: their
   influence would explain a pattern of anomalous low-tropospheric
   westerlies that typically tends to cause episodes of above-average
   rainfall. Also, the observed dry trends cannot be associated with two
   circulation features that cause dry episodes in the region: an intrusion
   of the North Atlantic subtropical high, and an intensified Caribbean
   Low-Level Jet. On the other hand, the results suggest that the dry
   trends might have been intensified by the land-sea contrast trend that
   has characterized the effects of global warming on the low-tropospheric
   pressure fields during the last decades; land-sea contrast would
   increase the vertical stability over land, suppressing convection. From
   these results, the influence of the AMO and the PDO is speculated to
   have been instrumental in preventing even drier trends. These insights
   suggest that dry trends in the region might be expected to worsen in the
   coming decades since the AMO and the PDO are expected to change their
   phase, and the land-sea contrast trend is expected to continue with a
   positive trend.},

Abstract = {The B oilfield is a large integrated oilfield in the Middle East.
   Asphaltene precipitates from crude oil and deposits on solid surfaces,
   affording considerable blockages of the formation, wellbore, and
   production equipment. To fully understand the asphaltene precipitation
   trend and deposition mechanism deeply, and solve the abovementioned
   problems in the B oilfield, fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
   proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and isothermal depressurization
   experiments (IDEs) have been conducted to predict the asphaltene
   precipitation trend of an oil sample. According to the experiments, the
   saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene ratios were 5.6\%, 37.4\%,
   33.1\%, and 15.9\%, respectively. The calculated colloidal instability
   index reached 0.88, indicating a risk of asphaltene precipitation. Based
   on IDEs, asphaltene precipitation was observed in the view cell window
   at 3196, 3545, and 3750 psi at different temperatures. Furthermore, the
   asphaltene deposition mechanism was studied on a string surface at the
   microscale based on molecular simulations and control measures were
   proposed. According to the simulations, the deposition process is found
   to be spontaneous. Asphaltene molecules were self-assembled and formed
   nanoaggregates in the form of a pi-pi conjugation. They were deposited
   parallelly on the string with a ``face-to-face{''} pattern. When the
   simulation temperature reached 325 K, asphaltene deposition reached the
   maximum under the simulation conditions. Compared with omitting
   dispersants, the average distance between the asphaltene molecules and
   string mass center improved and the energy of the system had
   considerably lowered after adding dispersants, implying that dispersants
   can effectively weaken the asphaltene deposition process. This paper
   provides some suggestions for preventing and removing blockages of
   electric pumps caused by asphaltene deposition. (C) 2021 Sichuan

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on the behaviour of
   intensity-duration-frequency curves is critical to the estimation of
   design storms, and thus to the safe design of drainage infrastructure.
   The present study develops a regional time trend methodology that
   detects the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation from 1960
   to 2010. The regional time trend linear regression method is fitted to
   different durations of annual maximum precipitation intensities derived
   from multiple sites in Ontario, Canada. The results show the
   relationship between climate change and increased extreme precipitation
   in this province. The regional trend analysis demonstrates, under
   nonstationary conditions arising from climate change, that the intensity
   of extreme precipitation increased decennially between 1.25\% for the
   30-min storm and 1.82\% for the 24-h storm. A comparison of the results
   with a regional Mann-Kendall test validates the found regional
   time-trend results. The results are employed to extrapolate the
   intensity-duration-frequency curves temporally and spatially for future
   decades across the province. The results of the regional time trend
   assessment help with the establishment of new safety margins for
   infrastructure design in Ontario. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {Seasonal linear trends of precipitation from South American station
   data, which have been averaged onto grids, are examined, with emphasis
   on the central continent. In the period 1976-99, the largest trend south
   of 20degreesS occurs during the January-March season, is positive, and
   is centered over southern Brazil. From 1948 to 1975 the trend is also
   positive, but with less than half the slope. The trend is not due to a
   systematic change in the timing of the rainy season, which almost always
   starts before January and usually ends after March, but rather results
   from an increase in the percent of rainy days, and an increase in the
   rainy day average. The dynamic causes of the trend are not obvious. It
   does not appear to be accounted for by an increase in synoptic wave
   activity in the region. The precipitation trend is related to a positive
   sea surface temperature trend in the nearby Atlantic Ocean, but
   apparently not causally. The trend in the Atlantic seems to result from
   a decrease in mechanical stirring and coastal upwelling associated with
   a decrease in the strength of the western edge of the circulation
   associated with the South Atlantic high.},

Abstract = {Time series of U.S. daily heavy precipitation (95th percentile) are
   analyzed to determine factors responsible for regionality and
   seasonality in their 1979-2013 trends. For annual conditions, contiguous
   U.S. trends have been characterized by increases in precipitation
   associated with heavy daily events across the northern United States and
   decreases across the southern United States. Diagnosis of climate
   simulations (CCSM4 and CAM4) reveals that the evolution of observed sea
   surface temperatures (SSTs) was a more important factor influencing
   these trends than boundary condition changes linked to external
   radiative forcing alone. Since 1979, the latter induces widespread, but
   mostly weak, increases in precipitation associated with heavy daily
   events. The former induces a meridional pattern of northern U.S.
   increases and southern U.S. decreases as observed, the magnitude of
   which closely aligns with observed changes, especially over the south
   and far west. Analysis of model ensemble spread reveals that appreciable
   35-yr trends in heavy daily precipitation can occur in the absence of
   forcing, thereby limiting detection of the weak anthropogenic influence
   at regional scales.
   Analysis of the seasonality in heavy daily precipitation trends supports
   physical arguments that their changes during 1979-2013 have been
   intimately linked to internal decadal ocean variability and less so to
   human-induced climate change. Most of the southern U.S. decrease has
   occurred during the cold season that has been dynamically driven by an
   atmospheric circulation reminiscent of teleconnections linked to cold
   tropical eastern Pacific SSTs. Most of the northeastern U.S. increase
   has been a warm season phenomenon, the immediate cause for which remains
   unresolved.},

Abstract = {Changes in precipitation frequency can have a major impact on many
   different sectors including agriculture, tourism, and recreation. This
   study investigates trends in precipitation days at first-order weather
   stations across the conterminous United States from 1951 to 2015. The
   Mann-Kendall test and sliding window correlation analysis are used to
   examine trends over time. Future precipitation days are forecasted via
   usage of a stepwise auto-regressive model. The Mann-Kendall test found
   that the majority of the Northeast and Midwestern states show upward
   trends in precipitation days, while negative trends are located in the
   Southeast and in clusters throughout the Northwest. Sliding window
   correlation analysis was used to detect the decade when most of the
   change in precipitation days occurred. The northeastern United States
   had more significant changes during the earlier decades whereas the
   centre part of the country had more significant changes in the later
   decades. Most stations saw more decades with positive (increasing)
   trends in precipitation days. Precipitation days are expected to
   increase for most of the United States into the future.},

Abstract = {Precipitation data from the period 1961-2010 and from a dense rain-gauge
   network over Croatia is analysed for spatial characteristics of trends
   in precipitation amounts and precipitation indices. Besides large
   spatial variability, the area is characterized by large temporal
   (seasonal) variability. Thus, analysis is performed on annual and
   seasonal scales over seven predefined subregions. Ten precipitation
   indices are selected to assess the intensity and frequency of extreme
   events as well as their contribution to annual and seasonal
   precipitation changes. The results reveal that the changes in annual and
   seasonal amounts are predominantly weak. A significant trend is detected
   only for annual amounts (negative) in the mountainous region and for
   summer (negative) in the mountainous littoral, mountainous region and
   central hinterland. A significant positive trend for autumn appears in
   eastern mainland. Negative trends in summer are associated with a
   decrease in frequency of moderate wet days, in maximal 1- and 5-day
   precipitation and in an increase in light precipitation. A negative
   annual trend is mainly caused by a decrease in frequency of very wet
   days and their contribution to the total precipitation. A positive
   autumn trend is associated with more very wet days and an increase of
   their contribution to the total precipitation as well as an increase in
   maximal 1- and 5-day precipitation. This study complements the existing
   analysis of five Croatian secular data series of extreme precipitation
   indices by involving the whole precipitation dataset since the
   mid-twentieth century and fills the gap present in the trend assessment
   of precipitation trends in Mediterranean and Europe.},

Abstract = {The Sahel region has been identified as a ``hot spot'' of global
   environmental change, but understanding of the roles of different
   climatic and anthropogenic forcing factors driving change in the region
   is incomplete. We show that a process-based ecosystem model driven by
   climatic and atmospheric CO2 data alone closely reproduces the
   satellite-observed greening trend of the Sahel vegetation and its
   interannual variability between 1982 and 1998. Changes in precipitation
   were identified as the primary driver of the aggregated simulated
   vegetation changes. According to the model, the increasing carbon uptake
   through vegetation was associated with an increasing relative carbon
   sink; but integrated over the whole period, the Sahel was predicted to
   be a net source of carbon.},

Abstract = {Regional characteristics of recent precipitation indices in China were
   analyzed from a daily rainfall dataset based on 494 stations during 1961
   to 2000. Some indices such as precipitation percentiles, precipitation
   intensity, and precipitation persistence were used and their
   inter-decadal differences were shown in this study.
   Over the last 40 years, precipitation indices in China showed increasing
   and decreasing trends separated into three main regions. A decreasing
   trend of annual precipitation and summer precipitation was observed from
   the southern part of northeast China to the mid-low Yellow River valley
   and the upper Yangtze River valley. This region also showed a decreasing
   trend in precipitation intensity and a decreasing trend in the frequency
   of persistent wet days. On the other hand, increasing trends in
   precipitation intensity were found in the Xinjiang region (northwest
   China), the northern part of northeast China, and southeast China,
   mainly to the south of the mid-low Yangtze River. The indices of
   persistent wet days and strong rainfall have contributed to the
   increasing frequency of floods in southeast China and the Xinjiang
   region in the last two decades. Persistent dry days and weakening
   rainfall have resulted in the increasing frequency of drought along the
   Yellow River valley including North China.
   Regional precipitation characteristics and trends in precipitation
   indices indicate the climate state variations in the last four decades.
   A warm-wet climate state was found in northwest China and in the
   northern part of northeast China. A warm-dry climate state extends from
   the southern part of northeast China to the Yellow River valley, while a
   cool-wet summer was found in southeast China, particularly in the
   mid-low Yangtze River valley over the last two decades.},

Title = {Convective precipitation trends in the Spanish Mediterranean region},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {257},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {This paper aims to analyse the distribution and temporal evolution of
   convective precipitation in the Mediterranean region of Spain. To
   accomplish this goal, we used 148 sets of 5-min rainfall rate data from
   the 1989-2015 period. The selected regions were the Jucar Hydrographic
   Confederation (CHJ) and the Internal Basins of Catalonia (CIC), which
   cover most of the autonomous communities of Catalonia and the Valencian
   Community (east Spain). The average 5-min intensity threshold of 35 mm/h
   and the beta parameter, defined as the ratio between convective
   precipitation versus total precipitation in any period, were used to
   characterise convective precipitation. Convective episodes were
   categorised as ``very convective{''}, ``moderately convective{''}, and
   ``slightly convective{''} based on the beta value. After quality
   control, the series of 129 stations were clustered into homogeneous
   precipitation zones that also include beta as one of the variables of
   characterisation. The results show that convective precipitation can
   contribute to total annual precipitation by up to 16\% on average, but
   it is generated by a very small percentage of convective events (between
   3\% and 6\% across all the stations) in comparison with the total number
   of rainfall episodes. In this sense, moderately convective events are
   the most common, with a predominantly unimodal monthly distribution of
   beta, with summer the most convective season. Trends show a significant
   increase in precipitation, convective precipitation, and convective
   episodes in the CHJ. On the other hand, a positive trend of convective
   events is predominant in the CIC region, despite an overall
   precipitation decrease in the analysed period. These results are
   relevant given that extreme daily rainfall does not show a positive or
   significant trend, and they are in line with the impact of climate
   change on increased atmospheric instability and water vapour in the
   atmosphere. They highlight the need to work with sub-daily precipitation
   series in the case of the Mediterranean, which is mainly affected by
   flash floods.},

Abstract = {The intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events are of great
   concern for water resources over the Indian Himalayas, where climate
   change is rapidly progressive. The long-term trends of extreme
   precipitation events have been examined during the winter season
   (November to April; 1996-2016) using the data of 10 observatories
   maintained by the Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) over the
   Northwest Himalaya (NWH) region. The extreme events are categorized into
   seven indices, which are 90(th) and 95(th) percentiles, rainy days, and
   maximum 1-d, 3-d, 5-d and total accumulated precipitation. The analysis
   shows increasing trends for all seven indices for the peak month of
   February for all Himalayan ranges and altitudes. The rainy days are
   significantly increased at a 95\% confidence level in the Pir-Panjal
   Range. The teleconnection study reveals that the negative correlation
   between the North Atlantic Oscillation and winter precipitation extremes
   is critical for the inter-monthly precipitation behaviours over the NWH.},

Abstract = {The England and Wales precipitation (EWP) dataset is a homogeneous time
   series of daily accumulations from 1931 to 2014, composed from rain
   gauge observations spanning the region. The daily regional-average
   precipitation statistics are shown to be well described by a Weibull
   distribution, which is used to define extremes in terms of percentiles.
   Computed trends in annual and seasonal precipitation are sensitive to
   the period chosen, due to large variability on interannual and decadal
   timescales. Atmospheric circulation patterns associated with seasonal
   precipitation variability are identified. These patterns project onto
   known leading modes of variability, all of which involve displacements
   of the jet stream and storm-track over the eastern Atlantic. The
   intensity of daily precipitation for each calendar season is
   investigated by partitioning all observations into eight intensity
   categories contributing equally to the total precipitation in the
   dataset. Contrary to previous results based on shorter periods, no
   significant trends of the most intense categories are found between 1931
   and 2014. The regional-average precipitation is found to share
   statistical properties common to the majority of individual stations
   across England and Wales used in previous studies. Statistics of the EWP
   data are examined for multi-day accumulations up to 10days, which are
   more relevant for river flooding. Four recent years (2000, 2007, 2008
   and 2012) have a greater number of extreme events in the 3- and 5-day
   accumulations than any previous year in the record. It is the duration
   of precipitation events in these years that is remarkable, rather than
   the magnitude of the daily accumulations.},

Abstract = {Variability in precipitation at scales from 1 to 10 days was
   investigated with the use of the time series measured at Prague-Sporilov
   (the Czech Republic) between 1994 and 2001. Variability was detected by
   the method of absolute difference in precipitation between two adjacent
   discrete time periods. The results indicated a general increase in
   precipitation variability at all investigated scales within the 8-yr
   observational period. The variability patterns also showed
   quasi-seasonal variations. The summer wetter season proved to be the
   most variable. The analysis was accomplished by the investigations of
   precipitation variability at a monthly scale based on a century-long
   historical time record. On a longer time perspective, precipitation
   variability exhibits a general increase interrupted by quasi-decadal
   oscillations. The range of quasi-decadal variability has become more
   pronounced after about 1950, the fact that hints the possibility of
   further intensification of the hydrologic cycle. An obtained significant
   correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) activity and
   precipitation variability implies that the NAO may account for a large
   fraction of precipitation variability. Higher NAO-index values tend to
   be associated with low variability. The variability investigations may
   have a certain implication for climate change assessments both at the
   local scales as well as associated with the build-up of greenhouse
   gases.},

Abstract = {Concern about anthropogenic climate change has heightened the need for
   accurate information about spatial and temporal variations in
   precipitation at the Earth's surface. Large-scale precipitation
   estimates can be derived from either surface gauge measurements or by
   satellite remote sensing, both of which have shortcomings. Gauge
   measurements provide information about trends and variability of monthly
   precipitation throughout the entire twentieth century, but because of
   the lack of data from most ocean regions, this information is
   representative of only about 25-30\% of the Earth's surface. In
   contrast, satellite (especially multi-platform) measurements provide
   spatially complete coverage at monthly to subdaily resolution, but do
   not extend back beyond 1974. Merged gauge-satellite datasets maximize
   (and minimize) the relative benefits (and shortcomings) of each source
   type. While these merged products only extend back to 1979, their
   importance will grow as we move into the new century.
   Precipitation gauge data indicate that global land precipitation
   (excluding Antarctica) has increased by about 9 mm over the twentieth
   century (a trend of 0.89 mm/decade), which is relatively small compared
   with interannual and multi-decadal variability. Within this century-long
   trend, global precipitation exhibits considerable variability on decadal
   time-scales, with departures of up to +/- 40 mm from the century mean of
   about 950 mm. Regionally, precipitation has increased over most land
   areas. with the exception of tropical North Africa, and parts of
   southern Africa, Amazonia and western South America. The dominant mode
   of interannual variability in global and hemispheric land precipitation
   is related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which explains
   about 38\% of the interannual variance in globally averaged land
   precipitation and about 8\% of the space-time variability of global
   precipitation. In the mid- and high latitudes, the Arctic and Antarctic
   oscillation (AO and AAO) are the dominant modes of interannual climate
   variability. The AO explains 48 and 35\% of area-averaged winter
   precipitation variability over land in the latitude bands 60-80degreesN
   and 40-60degreesN, respectively. The North Atlantic Oscillation is not
   an important modulator of global precipitation. but it does explain of
   annual (more in winter) variability in spatially averaged northern
   mid-latitude precipitation. Analyses of precipitation over land and
   ocean (spatially complete) since 1980 indicate that only a few regions
   show marked trends in precipitation over this short period. but there is
   a suggestion that there has been a shift in zonal precipitation. There
   are coherent regions where the tropical ENSO signal extends in a
   northeast, southeast direction into the subtropics, especially in the
   Pacific-Indonesian region, but also over the Atlantic-African and Indian
   Ocean domains.
   Data from a number of countries provide evidence of increased intensity
   of daily precipitation, generally manifested through increased frequency
   of wet days and an increased proportion of total precipitation occurring
   during the heaviest events. Over most land areas there has also been an
   increase in the persistence of wet spells. Copyright 0 2001 Royal

Abstract = {Study region North and South Carolina, USA.Study focus Intense
   precipitation poses risks to life and property. Its frequency can change
   in response to global-scale drivers, but its spatial expression can vary
   seasonally and regionally, and be dependent on how it is measured and
   what analysis period is used. We investigate forty-four historical
   stations from the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) across
   North and South Carolina to determine trends in the pluviometric regime
   defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices
   (ETCCDI).New hydrological insights for the region Most of the stations
   in this area do not display consistent, statistically significant trends
   across the suite of ETCCDI measures of precipitation amount, frequency,
   and intensity. In addition, the direction, spatial patterns and cross
   seasonal results are not consistent for the small number of stations
   that do show a trend in annual or seasonal precipitation totals. A third
   of stations have a statistically significant increasing trend in the
   annual number of light rain days; these generally match those with a
   statistically significant trend in wet days. Relatively few stations,
   typically around 10 per cent, have statistically significant trends in
   precipitation intensity measures. Notable exceptions include 2-and 5-day
   fall maximum precipitation values. Our findings contribute to a broader
   literature regarding trends in the southeastern United States (SEUS) and
   have significant relevance in adaptation planning that seeks to
   understand the relative contribution of multiple causes of natural
   hazards.},

Abstract = {Trends and changes in precipitation extremes have been a focus of
   research over the past decade. Observations show that changes are
   occurring in the amount, intensity, frequency and type of precipitation.
   Climate variability has created the need to study subsequent changes in
   hydroclimatic variables (e.g. rainfall, streamflow and
   evapotranspiration) to understand the regional effects of climate
   change. Mainly agricultural activities and water management activities -
   water supply, urban drainage, and hydraulic structures management are
   patterned according to rainfall seasonality. Trend detection in
   precipitation time series is crucial for water resources management.
   Many researchers all over the word have investigated hydrologic
   variables trends at various temporal scales. In this paper we
   investigate the trends in precipitation time series in climatic station
   Kosice, Slovakia in the period 1981-2013. We address the topic of trend
   detection in precipitation time series combining novel and traditional
   tools in order to simultaneously tackle the issue of seasonality and
   interannual variability, which usually characterize natural processes.
   The analysis proves that, in the case study area, statistically
   significant trends in precipitation have been undergoing in the last
   decades, although they have no significant impacts on water resources.},

Abstract = {Significant trends in precipitation extremes over Europe since the
   middle of the 20th century have been found in earlier studies. Most of
   these studies are based on descriptive indices of moderate extremes that
   occur on average a few times per year. Here we have analyzed rarer
   precipitation events which occur on average once in 5, 10 and 20years in
   the 1950s and 1960s using extreme value theory. We have focused on the
   1-d and 5-d precipitation amounts in Northern and Southern Europe in all
   four seasons. Changes over the time period 1951-2010 are studied by
   considering five consecutive 20-year time intervals with 10-year
   overlap. Despite considerable decadal variability, our results indicate
   that 5-, 10- and 20-year events of 1-d and 5-d precipitation for the
   first 20-year period generally became more common during this 60-year
   period. For all regions, seasons and return periods, the median
   reduction in return period between the first and last 20-year periods is
   approximate to 21\% with variations between a decrease of approximate to
   2\% and approximate to 58\%.},

Abstract = {Six in situ precipitation time series of varying time periods in the
   northwestern region and the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre
   (GPCC) v6 0.5A degrees monthly dataset (1901-2010) were statistically
   examined for monotonic trends in Trinidad. The Pettit test was used to
   investigate the abrupt changes in the mean while the Mann-Kendall test
   was employed to assess the monotonic trends. It was found that three in
   situ stations and the six grids experienced abrupt changes in the
   rainfall patterns and that there was an apparent shift in the seasons.
   In addition, for five out of the six in situ stations no monotonic
   change was detected in the monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall
   patterns. Gradual decreases were detected in the calculated weighted
   area average for five stations, the GPCCv6 dataset and St. Ann's time
   series. The GPCCv6 data indicated that the dry season in the southern
   Trinidad is becoming drier. Results also suggested that the range
   between the greatest and lowest recorded rainfall values for some months
   have increased while others decreased. The gridded dataset appears to
   give a good representation of the dry season (January to May) rainfall
   compared with the wet season (June to December) and was found to be
   negatively biased for the north-western region but may not necessarily
   be so for the entire island. The results suggested that in the

   differences in precipitation trends during the transitional seasons
   among the three areas seem to be caused by the urbanization process. The

Journal = {METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {259-274},
Abstract = {Meteorological and glaciological analyses are integrated to examine the
   precipitation trends during the last three decades over the ice sheets
   covering Antarctica and Greenland. For Antarctica, the best data source
   is provided by glaciologically-measured trends of snow accumulation, and
   for limited sectors of East Antarctica consistency with precipitation
   amounts calculated from the atmospheric water balance equation is
   obtained. For Greenland, precipitation rates parameterized from
   atmospheric analyses yield the only comprehensive depiction. The
   precipitation rate over Antarctica appears to have increased by about
   5\% over a time period spanning the accumulation means for the 1955-65
   to 1965-75 periods, while over Greenland it has decreased by about 15\%
   since 1963 with a secondary increase over the southern part of the ice
   sheet starting in 1977. At the end of the 10-year overlapping period,
   the global sea-level impact of the precipitation changes over Antarctica
   dominates that for Greenland and yields a net ice-sheet precipitation
   contribution of roughly -0.2 mm yr-1. These changes are likely due to
   marked variations in the cyclonic forcing affecting the ice sheets, but
   are only weakly reflected in the temperature regime, consistent with the
   episodic nature of cyclonic precipitation.
   These conclusions are not founded on high quality data bases. The
   importance of such changes for understanding global sea-level variations
   argues for a modest research effort to collect simultaneous
   meteorological and glaciological observations in order to describe and
   understand the current precipitation variations over both ice sheets.
   Some suggestions are offered for steps that could be taken.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {African precipitation trends are commonly analyzed using short-term data
   observed over small areas. This study analyzed changes in long-term
   (1901-2015) annual and seasonal precipitation of high spatial (0.5
   degrees x 0.5 degrees grid) resolution covering the entire African
   continent. To assess an acceleration/deceleration of the precipitation
   increase/decrease, trend magnitude (mm/year) over the period 1991-2015
   was subtracted from that of 1965-1990 to obtain Slope Difference (SD,
   mm/year). Co-variation of precipitation sub-trends with changes in
   large-scale ocean-atmosphere conditions was investigated. Regardless of
   the trend significance, in most parts of Africa, annual precipitation
   exhibited negative (positive) trends over the period 1965-1990
   (1991-2015). Thus, the continent was, on average, recently (from 1991 to
   2015) wetter than it was over the period 1965-1990. From 1901 to 2015,
   the null hypothesis H-0 (no trend) was rejected (p < 0.05) for annual
   precipitation decrease over West Africa especially along the coastal
   areas near the Gulf of Guinea. The H-0 was also rejected (p < 0.05) for
   the increase in annual and September-November precipitation of some
   areas along the Equatorial region (such as in Gabon and around Lake
   Victoria). For both annual and seasonal precipitation, the least SD
   values in the range - 1 to 1 mm/year were obtained in areas north of 10
   degrees N. The SD value went up to about 20 mm/year over the Sahel belt
   especially for the peak monsoon (June-August season). For the March-May
   precipitation, positive SD values were obtained in the Western part of
   Southern Africa. However, negative SD values (around - 5 mm/year) were
   obtained in the Horn of Africa. Variation in sub-trends of the East
   African precipitation was found to be driven by changes in Sea Surface
   Temperature (SST) of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Variability in
   sub-trends of the West African precipitation is linked to changes in SST
   of the Atlantic Ocean. Changes in sub-trends of the South African
   precipitation correspond to anomalies in SST from the Pacific and Indian
   Oceans. Knowledge of precipitation changes and possible drivers is vital
   for predictive adaptation regarding the impacts of climate variability
   on hydro- or agro-meteorology.},

Journal = {NORDIC HYDROLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-36},
Abstract = {Two different methods were applied to estimate long-term precipitation
   trends representative for regions in Norway. A new method, comparative
   trend analysis (CTA), was applied on 142 homogeneous precipitation
   series of 70-100 years. In this way, 12 precipitation trend regions were
   identified. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on a subset
   of 30 series during the period 1896-1994. The results from both analyses
   were used to estimate precipitation trend series at several locations.
   The estimates based upon the PCA were of same quality as the estimates
   based upon the CTA. However, by CTA it is possible to visualize the
   trend in a distinct region by using just one trend curve, while trend
   curves based on PCA are composed of contributions from 5 principal
   components.
   The resulting trend curves document that the annual precipitation level
   has increased by 8-14\% throughout this century in most Norwegian
   regions. The increase occurred not simultaneously all over the country.
   The regional differences in precipitation trends and variability are
   probably connected to variations in the atmospheric circulation
   patterns.},

Title = {Trend Analysis of Precipitation in the Thrace Peninsula},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-COGRAFYA DERGISI},
Year = {2023},
Number = {47},
Pages = {165-182},
Abstract = {This study focuses on the Thrace Peninsula located in the Marmara
   Region, comprising the territories of the provinces of Edirne,
   Kirklareli, Tekirdag, Istanbul, and Canakkale. The Thrace Peninsula is
   within the Mediterranean macroclimate region, where the regions
   receiving rainfall of over 600 mm cover the largest area. The highest
   and lowest annual average precipitation are observed in the
   municipalities of Sariyer (819.3 mm) and Corlu (576.6 mm), respectively.
   This study utilized the long-term precipitation data of 13
   meteorological stations located in and around the Thrace Peninsula
   between 1937 and 2021. Trend analyses of monthly, seasonal (winter,
   spring, summer, fall), semiannual (October-March, April-September), and
   annual total precipitation averages of the water year were performed
   using the Mann-Kendall test, Kendall's tau test, and Sen's slope test at
   a confidence interval of 95\% and statistical significance level of
   alpha = 0.05. The results of the monthly precipitation analysis show a
   significant negative trend in August, November, and February in
   Luleburgaz, Tekirdag, and Ipsala, and a significant positive trend in
   June and October, September, and June in Sariyer, Malkara, and
   Canakkale. In terms of seasonal average precipitation on the Thrace
   Peninsula, a statistically significant and positive trend was observed
   in Saryer in the summer and in Kumkoy and Sariyer in the fall. In terms
   of semiannual and annual precipitation averages, a statistically
   significant and positive trend was observed in Kumkoy, Corlu, and
   Sariyer between April and September and in Kumkoy and Sariyer annually.
   In terms of monthly maximum precipitation, a positive and significant
   trend was observed in orlu, Saryer, and Malkara. This study is expected
   to help in the formulation of plans and implementation of measures to
   address potential water-related issues in the Thrace Peninsula, given
   the increasing demand for water and its resources.},

Number = {11},
Pages = {3904-3918},

Abstract = {This study investigates the presence of trends in annual maximum daily
   precipitation time series obtained from a global dataset of 8326
   high-quality land-based observing stations with more than 30 years of
   record over the period from 1900 to 2009. Two complementary statistical
   techniques were adopted to evaluate the possible nonstationary behavior
   of these precipitation data. The first was a Mann-Kendall nonparametric
   trend test, and it was used to evaluate the existence of monotonic
   trends. The second was a nonstationary generalized extreme value
   analysis, and it was used to determine the strength of association
   between the precipitation extremes and globally averaged near-surface
   temperature. The outcomes are that statistically significant increasing
   trends can be detected at the global scale, with close to two-thirds of
   stations showing increases. Furthermore, there is a statistically
   significant association with globally averaged near-surface temperature,
   with the median intensity of extreme precipitation changing in
   proportion with changes in global mean temperature at a rate of between
   5.9\% and 7.7\% K-1, depending on the method of analysis. This ratio was
   robust irrespective of record length or time period considered and was
   not strongly biased by the uneven global coverage of precipitation data.
   Finally, there is a distinct meridional variation, with the greatest
   sensitivity occurring in the tropics and higher latitudes and the minima
   around 13 degrees S and 11 degrees N. The greatest uncertainty was near
   the equator because of the limited number of sufficiently long
   precipitation records, and there remains an urgent need to improve data
   collection in this region to better constrain future changes in tropical
   precipitation.},

   historic rainfall variability across Scotland using different measures
   of variability. The CUSUM and sequential Mann-Kendall test applied to
   records from 28 weather stations with up to 80 years of daily
   precipitation data reveal the occurrence of abrupt changes in the
   rainfall trends. Most weather stations show a turning point between 1978
   and 1985, although some stations situated in Eastern Scotland have more
   than one turning point. The temporal changes in rainfall variability
   across Scotland are presented using a number of measures of variability.

Abstract = {Monthly precipitation trends of 160 stations in China from 1951-2002
   have been analysed and interpolated. The Mann-Kendall trend test was
   applied to examine the monthly precipitation data. Significant positive
   and negative trends at the 90, 95, and 99 percent confidence levels were
   detected for numerous stations. The number, distribution, and direction
   of the trends varied from month to month.
   The detected trends were spatially interpolated by applying the Inverse
   Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. The spatial presentation
   of the detected precipitation trends gives a better understanding of
   climatic changes or variations in China during the last 50 years. This
   is especially the case for highlighting the spatial structure of
   precipitation trends.
   A clustering of trends is observed in certain months, including distinct
   trend belts especially in east and north-east China. Nevertheless,
   positive as well as negative monthly trends can be noted simultaneously

Abstract = {Precipitation plays an important role in the Arctic hydrological cycle,
   affecting different areas like the surface energy budget and the mass
   balance of glaciers. Thus, accurate measurements of precipitation are
   crucial for physical process studies, but gauge measurements in the
   Arctic are sparse and subject to relocations and several gauge issues.
   From Svalbard, we analyze precipitation trends at six weather stations
   for the last 50-100 years by combining different observation series and
   adjusting for inhomogeneities. For the past 50 years, the measured
   annual precipitation has increased by 30\%-45\%. However, precipitation
   measurements in the cold and windy climate are strongly influenced by
   gauge undercatch. Correcting for undercatch reduces the trend values by
   10\% points, since the fraction of solid precipitation has decreased and
   undercatch is larger for solid precipitation. Thus, precipitation
   corrected for undercatch should be used to study ``true{''}
   precipitation trends in the Arctic. Precipitation over Svalbard has been
   modeled by downscaling reanalysis data to a spatial resolution of 1 km.
   In general, the modeled annual precipitation is higher (13\%-175\%) than
   the measured values and mainly higher than the precipitation corrected
   for undercatch. Although the model resolves orographic effects on a
   regional scale, the downscaling is not able to reproduce local
   orographic enhancement for onshore winds, nor local effects of rain
   shadow. The downscaled dataset explains approximately 60\% of the
   interannual precipitation variability. The model-based trends during
   1979-2018 are positive, but weaker (similar to 4\% decade(-1)) than the
   observed (similar to 8\% decade(-1)) trends.},

Abstract = {Radar data from the 2004 North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME)
   enhanced observing period were used to investigate diurnal trends and
   vertical structure of precipitating features relative to local terrain.
   Two-dimensional composites of reflectivity and rain rate, created from
   the two Servicio Meteorologico Nacional (SMN; Mexican Weather Service)
   C-band Doppler radars and NCAR's S-band polarimetric Doppler radar
   (S-Pol), were divided into four elevation groups: over water, 0-1000 m
   (MSL), 1000-2000 m, and greater than 2000 m. Analysis of precipitation
   frequency and average rainfall intensity using these composites reveals
   a strong diurnal trend in precipitation similar to that observed by the
   NAME Event Rain Gauge Network. Precipitation occurs most frequently
   during the afternoon over the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO), with the
   peak frequency moving over the lower elevations by evening. Also, the
   precipitation events over the lower elevations are less frequent but of
   greater intensity (rain rate) than those over the SMO. Precipitation
   echoes were partitioned into convective and stratiform components to
   allow for examination of vertical characteristics of convection using
   data from S-Pol. Analyses of reflectivity profiles and echo-top heights
   confirm that convection over the lower terrain is more intense and
   vertically developed than convection over the SMO. Warm-cloud depths,
   estimated from the Colorado State University-NAME upper-air and surface
   gridded analyses are, on average, 2 times as deep over the lower terrain
   as compared with over the SMO. Using a simplified stochastic model for
   drop growth, it is shown that these differences in warm-cloud depths
   could possibly explain the observed elevation-dependent trends in
   precipitation intensity.},

Title = {Trend and Homogeneity Analysis of Precipitation in Iran},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to examine trend and homogeneity
   through the analysis of rainfall variability patterns in Iran. The study
   presents a review on the application of homogeneity and seasonal time
   series analysis methods for forecasting rainfall variations. Trend and
   homogeneity methods are applied in the time series analysis from
   collecting rainfall data to evaluating results in climate studies. For
   the homogeneity analysis of monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall,
   homogeneity tests were used in 140 stations in the 1975-2014 period. The
   homogeneity of the monthly and annual rainfall at each station was
   studied using the autocorrelation (ACF), and the von Neumann (VN) tests
   at a significance level of 0.05. In addition, the nature of the monthly
   and seasonal rainfall series in Iran was studied using the
   Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test, the Thumb test (TT), and the least squares
   regression (LSR) test at a significance level of 0.05. The present
   results indicate that the seasonal patterns of rainfall exhibit
   considerable diversity across Iran. Rainfall seasonality is generally
   less spatially coherent than temporal patterns in Iran. The seasonal
   variations of rainfall decreased significantly throughout eastern and
   central Iran, but they increased in the west and north of Iran during
   the studied interval. The present study comparisons among variations of
   patterns with the seasonal rainfall series reveal that the variability
   of rainfall can be predicted by the non-trended and trended patterns.},

Abstract = {The temporal variability of precipitation in southern Spain was analysed
   to detect trends and cycles. The objectives of this study were (1) to
   determine whether there has been a decrease in precipitation in southern
   Spain and (2) to evaluate if any decrease is related to temporal cycles
   or is a well-defined trend. The study was based on analysis of data
   series from nine monitoring stations in the Andalusia area of the
   Spanish Mediterranean. The Pettit test and temporal variability analyses
   were carried out using the temporal databases (19602006) from the
   selected stations. The results indicate that (1) there were significant
   differences in precipitation throughout the study period based on the
   location of the stations; (2) a negative trend in precipitation was
   observed for the east coast and inland stations, and an increasing trend
   in precipitation was observed for stations on the west coast; and (3) a
   general decreasing trend in seasonal precipitation, especially in
   winter, autumn, and spring, was observed for all stations except those
   on the west coast. Copyright (c) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {The complex topography and high climatic variability of the North
   Western Mediterranean Basin (NWMB) require a detailed assessment of
   climate change projections at high resolution. ECHAM5/MPIOM global
   climate projections for mid-21st century and three different emission
   scenarios are downscaled at 10 km resolution over the NWMB, using the
   WRF-ARW regional model. High resolution improves the spatial
   distribution of temperature and precipitation climatologies, with
   Pearson's correlation against observation being higher for WRF-ARW (0.98
   for temperature and 0.81 for precipitation) when compared to the ERA40
   reanalysis (0.69 and 0.53, respectively). However, downscaled results
   slightly underestimate mean temperature (a parts per thousand 1.3 K) and
   overestimate the precipitation field (a parts per thousand 400 mm/year).
   Temperature is expected to raise in the NWMB in all considered scenarios
   (up to 1.4 K for the annual mean), and particularly during summertime
   and at high altitude areas. Annual mean precipitation is likely to
   decrease (around -5 \% to -13 \% for the most extreme scenarios). The
   climate signal for seasonal precipitation is not so clear, as it is
   highly influenced by the driving GCM simulation. All scenarios suggest
   statistically significant decreases of precipitation for mountain ranges
   in winter and autumn. High resolution simulations of regional climate
   are potentially useful to decision makers. Nevertheless, uncertainties
   related to seasonal precipitation projections still persist and have to
   be addressed.},

Abstract = {Climatic time series data are often nonlinear and non-stationary and
   hence the use of traditional techniques may not be suitable for their
   analysis. This research is focused on the monthly series of air
   temperature and precipitation data of 25 years from 1988 to 2012 at
   Langtang Meteorological Station (LMS), Kyangjing in Langtang River
   basin, Nepal to extract multi-scale cycles and trends. To address the
   non-linearity and non-stationary of these time series, we used Empirical
   Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. EMD decomposed LMS temperature and
   precipitation series into different oscillatory modes called Intrinsic
   Mode Functions (IMFs) and residue called trend. The extracted IMFs are
   subjected to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to determine their average
   period along with their power density. There exist oscillations of 1
   year, 3.13 years, 6.25 years, 8.33 years and 12.5 years in temperature
   data. Among these cycles, only 1 year cycle is distinguished from
   Gaussian white noise at 95\% confidence level. The air temperature at
   LMS, Kyangjing reflects monotonic positive trend till 2006 but remains
   as nearly steady state around 3 degrees C from the end of 2006.
   Similarly, the precipitation data is embedded with cycles of 6 months, 1
   year, 2.08 years, 2.27 years and 8.33 years of which only the first
   three are statistically significant at 95\% confidence level. The
   precipitation shows a mixed trend with decreasing pattern till mid
   1990s, increasing pattern till mid 2000s and again decreasing pattern
   till 2012. One year cycle is dominant in both the time series data. The
   above results reflect that temperature and precipitation fluctuates on
   various time scales. The effect of the changes in temperature and
   precipitation has already been manifested in the form of melting
   glaciers in this region. The causes for these oscillations might be
   related to phenomenon like Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO), solar
   activity. El Nino, monsoon climate dynamics and other local
   characteristics of the basin.},

   agricultural, environmental and water resources projects. Generally,
   trend test performs for evaluation of direction and magnitude of
   changes, but the test is not able to demonstrate abrupt change in time
   series if it occurs. The trends of maximum atmospheric temperature,
   rainfall are analysed for meteorological data of Anand district in
   Central Gujarat India. The long-term change in temperature, rainfall
   (Seasonal \& Annual) has been analysed by correlation and linear trend
   analysis. The increasing trend in MMAX temperature and decreasing trends
   in TMRF, TMRF (J-S), is observed and is confirmed by Mann-Kendall trend
   test. It is observed that annual MMAX temperature has increased and
   annual TMRF decreased during the last 41 years in Anand of Central
   Gujarat., the TMRF (J-S) shows statistically significant decreasing
   trend shows statistically insignificant decreasing trend during the last
   41 years and is confirmed by Mann Kendall trend at 5\% level of
   significance. The Maximum temperature, rainfall during period 1970 to
   2011 obtained from Department of Agricultural Meteorology, Anand were
   analysed. It is observed that Mean of maximum temperature shows
   increasing trend, total monthly rainfall and total monthly rainfall in
   the rainy season days shows decreasing trend in Anand of central
   Gujarat.},

Title = {Intensified Moisture Sources of Heavy Precipitation Events Contributed
   to Interannual Trend in Precipitation Over the Three-Rivers-Headwater
   Region in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Evidence has indicated an overall wetting trend over the Three-Rivers
   Headwater Region (TRHR) in the recent decades, whereas the possible
   mechanisms for this change remain unclear. Detecting the main moisture
   source regions of the water vapor and its increasing trend over this
   region could help understand the long-term precipitation change. Based
   on the gauge-based precipitation observation analysis, we find that the
   heavy precipitation events act as the main contributor to the
   interannual increasing trend of summer precipitation over the TRHR. A
   Lagrangian moisture tracking methodology is then utilized to identify
   the main moisture source of water vapor over the target region for the
   boreal summer period of 1980-2017, with focus particularly on exploring
   its change associated with the interannual trend of precipitation. On an
   average, the moisture sources for the target regions cover vast regions,
   including the west and northwest of the Tibetan Plateau by the
   westerlies, the southwest by the Indian summer monsoon, and the adjacent
   regions associated with the local recycling. However, the increased
   interannual precipitation trend over the TRHR could be largely
   attributed to the enhanced moisture sources from the neighboring
   northeastern areas of the targeted region, particularly associated with
   the heavy precipitation events. The increased water vapor transport from
   the neighboring areas of the TRHR potentially related to the enhanced
   local hydrological recycling over these regions plays a first leading
   role in the recent precipitation increase over the TRHR.},

Abstract = {Six meteorological variables from all available Romanian weather
   stations were tested for trends at annual scale over the 1961-2013
   period. Changes in annual air temperature, precipitation, sunshine
   hours, nebulosity, relative humidity and wind speed were investigated.
   The Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend test was used in order to find
   statistically-significant trends, whilst the magnitude of trends was
   estimated using the Kendall-Theil method. The results point to
   significant climatic changes at annual scale in Romania. The most
   drastic change regards the air temperature, which is increasing at all
   stations. The number of sunshine hours follows a similar pattern,
   increasing at most stations - except in the mountainous regions of
   Meridional and Curvature Carpathians. The wind speed presents a
   significant decreasing signal at the majority of the locations, in
   agreement with the overall tendency of terrestrial stilling. The annual
   precipitation amount is rather stable, with increasing trends
   North-Western Romania and decreasing trends in the Danube Delta
   (South-East). Cloud cover is generally decreasing, and the relative
   humidity shows mixed trends. Our findings are in good agreement with
   previous studies on climatic variability in Romania.},

Abstract = {Studies associated with climate change and variability are of great
   importance at both the global and local scale in the global climate
   crisis. In this study, change-point detection and trend analysis were
   carried out on mean, maximum, minimum air temperatures and total
   precipitation based on monthly, seasonal and annual scale in Bartin
   province located in the western Black Sea Region of Turkey. For this
   aim, 4-different homogeneity tests (von Neumann test, Pettitt test,
   Buishand range test and standard normal homogeneity test) for
   change-point detection, Modified Mann-Kendall test and Sen's innovative
   trend test for trend analysis, and Sen's slope test for the magnitude
   estimation of trends were used. According to the test results, the
   summer temperatures in particular show increasing trends at the 0.001
   significance level. Mean maximum temperature in August, mean minimum
   temperature in June and August, and mean temperature in July and August
   are in increasing trend at the 0.001 significance level. Over a 51 year
   period (1965-2015) in Bartin province, the highest rate of change per
   decade in air temperatures is in August (0.55 degrees C for T-max, 0.46
   degrees C for T-min and 0.43 degrees C for T-mean) based on Sen's slope.
   However, the study showed that apart from October precipitation, there
   is no significant trend in monthly, seasonal and annual precipitation in
   Bartin. Increasing trends in mentioned climate variables are also
   visually very clear and strong in Sen's innovative trend method, and
   they comply with the statistical results. As a result, the study
   revealed some evidence that temperatures will increase in the future in
   Bartin and its environs.},

Abstract = {This study describes temperature and precipitation trends in the two
   National Parks located in the two highest mountain ranges on the Iberian
   Peninsula: the Sierra Nevada (Sierra Nevada National Park, SN) and the
   Pyrenees (Aig \& uuml;estortes i Sant Maurici National Park, ASM).
   Special focus is placed on analysing disparities between the lowlands
   and the highlands, as well as the agreement between observational data
   and grid data (IBERIA01 and E-OBS). For this purpose, a
   quality-controlled and homogeneity-adjusted database of the daily
   maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation (SMADS
   database) has been generated. Regional trends in mean temperature
   indicate that warming in ASM (0.17 degrees C<middle dot>decade(-1)) was
   greater than in the Sierra Nevada (SN) (0.13 degrees C<middle
   dot>decade(-1)) in the longest joint period, 1930-2020. For annual
   precipitation, the trends over the past nine decades were negative,
   although not significantly. Only the summer in SN showed a significant
   negative trend, which has intensified in recent decades to
   -13.4\%<middle dot>decade(-1) for 1975-2020. A parallel evolution was
   observed in the annual mean temperature of the highlands (>1500 m) and
   lowlands (<1500 m) of ASM, with a common trend of 0.17 degrees C<middle
   dot>decade(-1), while in SN negative elevation-dependent warming was
   detected. Differences between lowlands and highlands were also noted in
   precipitation trends in both mountain ranges: a positive trend in
   precipitation was found in the lowlands while in the highlands
   practically null trends (ASM) or decreasing precipitation trends (SN)
   were detected. The comparison of the Spanish Mountain Adjusted Daily
   Series (SMADS) results with the IBERIA01 and E-OBS grid series yielded
   differences no greater than +/- 0.2 degrees C<middle dot>decade(-1). No
   notable differences were detected between the regional trends calculated
   with observational series or with grid series. These results worsened
   when the differences in the trends detected in the individual observed
   temperature series were compared against the corresponding grid series.},

Abstract = {Air temperature has exhibited a clear positive trend over the past
   several decades throughout the arctic, including Alaska. Other
   variables, such as precipitation, have much more uncertain trends due to
   inhomogeneities in measurement and high internal variability. The use of
   linear regression to analyse precipitation in Alaska has resulted in
   often contradictory results. This paper proposes the use of Bayesian
   models such as the R package Rbeast to allow for the more nuanced
   analysis. The examples given in this paper show how Bayesian analysis
   can be used to detect subtle changes and better constrain the
   disagreement between data sources. Applied to gridded data, Bayesian
   analysis shows how precipitation has changed overtime across Alaska.
   Change has accelerated over the past decade, but only precipitation
   increase on the North Slope can be assigned high confidence. Overall,
   this analysis highlights how Bayesian techniques may be uniquely useful
   to climate research in regions with heterogeneous data sources and
   substantial internal variability.},

Abstract = {The precipitation variability, trends, and teleconnections are studied
   over six administrative regions of Pakistan (Gilgit-Baltistan or GB,
   Azad Jammu and Kashmir or AJK, Khyber Pakhtoonkhawa or KPK, Punjab,
   Sindh, and Balochistan) on multiple timescales for the period of recent
   38years (1976-2013) using precipitation data of 42 stations and
   circulation indices datasets (Indian Ocean Dipole {[}IOD], North
   Atlantic Oscillation {[}NAO], Arctic Oscillation {[}AO], El Nino
   Southern Oscillation {[}ENSO], Pacific Decadal Oscillation {[}PDO],
   Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation {[}AMO], and Quasi-Biennial
   Oscillation {[}QBO]). The summer monsoon season received the highest
   precipitation, amounting to 45\%, whereas the winter and pre-monsoon
   (post-monsoon) seasons contributed 30 and 20\% (5\%), respectively, of
   the annual total precipitation. Positive percentile changes were
   observed in GB, KPK, Punjab, and Balochistan regions during pre-monsoon
   season and in Balochistan region during post-monsoon season in second
   half as compared to first half of 38-year period. The Mann-Kendall test
   revealed increasing trends for the period of 1995-2013 as compared to
   period of 1976-1994 for entire Pakistan during monsoon season and on
   annual timescale. A significant influence of ENSO was observed in all
   the four seasons in Balochistan, KPK, Punjab, and AJK regions during
   monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. This study not only offers an
   understanding of precipitation variability linkages with large-scale
   circulations and trends, but also it contributes as a resource document
   for policy makers to take measures for adaptation and mitigation of
   climate change and its impacts with special focus on precipitation over
   different administrative regions of Pakistan.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine trends in gauging stations in
   Slovakia. We investigated 487 stations during the period 1981-2013.
   Monthly rainfall trends were detected by non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   statistical test. Precipitation trends show high variability. The
   precipitation time series in Slovakia in gauging stations in particular
   have an increasing trend, especially in the month of July. Achieved
   results can be the basis for the development of river basin management
   plans and within the framework of risk assessment they will address all
   aspects of environmental risk management focusing on prevention,
   protection, preparedness (including forecasts and early warning systems)
   and taking into account the characteristics of each river basin. It is
   highly desirable but also feasible to limit the risk of adverse
   consequences, especially for human health and life, the environment, the
   cultural heritage, the economic activity and the infrastructure
   associated with extreme hydrological phenomena in the river basins.
   However, measures to reduce these risks if they are to be effective must
   be as far as possible coordinated throughout the river basin. (C) 2016

   precipitation rate in the reanalysis data. The trend in the GPCP data is
   flat because of the balance between decreasing trends along equatorial

Pages = {877-891},
Abstract = {Precipitation events are expected to become substantially more intense
   under global warming, but few global comparisons of observations and
   climate model simulations are available to constrain predictions of
   future changes in precipitation extremes. We present a systematic
   global-scale comparison of changes in historical (1901-2010)
   annual-maximum daily precipitation between station observations
   (compiled in HadEX2) and the suite of global climate models contributing
   to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).
   We use both parametric and non-parametric methods to quantify the
   strength of trends in extreme precipitation in observations and models,
   taking care to sample them spatially and temporally in comparable ways.
   We find that both observations and models show generally increasing
   trends in extreme precipitation since 1901, with the largest changes in
   the deep tropics. Annual-maximum daily precipitation (Rx1day) has
   increased faster in the observations than in most of the CMIP5 models.
   On a global scale, the observational annual-maximum daily precipitation
   has increased by an average of 5.73mm over the last 110 years, or 8.5\%
   in relative terms. This corresponds to an increase of 10\% K-1 in global
   warming since 1901, which is larger than the average of climate models,
   with 8.3\% K-1. The average rate of increase in extreme precipitation
   per K of warming in both models and observations is higher than the rate
   of increase in atmospheric water vapor content per K of warming expected
   from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. We expect our findings to help
   inform assessments of precipitation-related hazards such as flooding,
   droughts and storms.},

Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Observations show that summer precipitation in China has undergone
   pronounced changes, resulting in an enigmatic ``north-south
   drying-wetting{''} pattern in eastern China that is of great concern for
   socio-economic development. Scientific consensus on the mechanisms that
   are responsible for this pattern of change has not yet been achieved. We
   show that this complex pattern of summer total precipitation trends
   observed in China since the 1960s is overwhelmingly the result of
   changes in daily precipitation frequency, rather than being the result
   of changes in precipitation intensity or the frequency of synoptic
   circulation patterns favorable to precipitation. Changes in
   precipitation intensity, which are very likely due to anthropogenic
   greenhouse gas forcing, contribute a relatively homogeneous wetting
   tendency across the country while changes due to synoptic circulation
   change are weak. The changes in daily precipitation frequency that drive
   the observed patterns of change may be due to aerosols, but improved
   process understanding will be required to resolve that question and
   enable reliable projections of regional scale precipitation change in
   China and elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of long-term changes in climate extremes is vital to better
   understand climate variability and place present day extreme events in
   historical context. Analysis of trends in extreme precipitation in
   Ireland have largely been limited to the second half of the 20th century
   due to lack of data availability in digital format. Using recently
   digitized data, this study provides the first assessment of long-term
   changes in extreme daily precipitation observed at 30 locations across
   Ireland. Quality control of rescued data is carried out before selected
   long-term stations are tested for homogeneity using the RHtests
   software. Details of detected breakpoints and the application of
   adjustments to daily values are discussed. Eleven extreme precipitation
   indices are calculated on an annual basis and analysed to determine
   spatial and temporal trends in the frequency, intensity and magnitude of
   observed precipitation. The persistence of trends for varying record
   lengths and for two fixed periods (1910-2019 and 1940-2019) of analysis
   is assessed for all stations and indices. Results show increases in
   precipitation intensity, especially notable in the east and southeast of
   the island. Our findings also show that the contribution of heavy and
   extreme precipitation events to annual totals is increasing, while there
   was no persistent trends in annual totals or consecutive wet or dry
   days.},

Title = {Long-term variations and trends in precipitation in Finland},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3139-3153},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Annual, seasonal and monthly variations in precipitation during the
   period 1911-2011 were evaluated using spatially interpolated monthly
   precipitation records at 165 stations with more than 30 years of data
   (of which 32 stations had 101 years of data referring to full length of
   study period). Historical trends and cyclic patterns of precipitation
   and links to teleconnection indices were analysed. The results show that
   annual precipitation in Finland increased by 0.92 +/- 0.50 mm year(-1)
   (p < 0.05) during the study period (1911-2011), and showed negative
   relationships with the East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR) teleconnection
   pattern (rho = -0.41, p < 0.05) through the years 1950-2011. However,
   there were spatial (north-south/east-west) differences between regions.
   The time cycle (lambda) for annual precipitation cycles was estimated to
   149 years (R-2 = 0.15), and 1964 was indicated as the turning point from
   a negative (dry) to a positive (wet) phase. Analysis of seasonal and
   monthly cycles showed larger variations, depending mainly on
   teleconnection effects. Analysis of seasonal precipitation determined
   increasing trends for winter (by 0.46 +/- 0.19 mm year(-1)) and summer
   (by 0.32 +/- 0.29 mm year(-1)), while no clear trend was found for
   spring and autumn precipitation (p > 0.05). Winter precipitation was
   most strongly correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index
   (rho = 0.55, p < 0.05), while the EA/WR pattern was the most significant
   teleconnection index for precipitation variations in spring (rho =
   -0.33, p < 0.05) and summer (rho = -0.49, p < 0.05); the precipitation
   variability during autumn was negatively associated with the Scandinavia
   (SCA) pattern (rho = -0.40, p < 0.05). The results clearly indicate that
   Finland has experienced wetter climate than normal conditions during
   recent decades, and precipitation in the Fenno-Scandinavian climate is
   controlled by a number of climate teleconnection indices, not just the
   NAO as previously assumed.},

Title = {Trends in Seasonal Precipitation over China during 1961-2007},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Pages = {165-171},
Abstract = {Trends in six indices of precipitation in China for seasons during
   1961-2007 were analyzed based on daily observations at 587 stations. The
   trends were estimated by using Sen's method with Mann-Kendall's test for
   quantifying the significance. The geographical patterns of trends in the
   seasonal indices of extremes were similar to those of total
   precipitation. For winter, both total and extreme precipitation
   increased over nearly all of China, except for a small part of northern
   China. Increasing trends in extreme precipitation also occurred at many
   stations in southwestern China for spring and the mid-lower reaches of
   the Yangtze River and southern China for summer. For autumn,
   precipitation decreased in eastern China, with an increasing length of
   maximum dry spell, implying a drying tendency for the post-rainy season.
   Wetting trends have prevailed in most of western China for all seasons.
   The well-known `flood in the south and drought in the north' trend
   exists in eastern China for summer, while a nearly opposite trend
   pattern exist for spring.},

Title = {The Centennial Trends Greater Horn of Africa precipitation dataset},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {East Africa is a drought prone, food and water insecure region with a
   highly variable climate. This complexity makes rainfall estimation
   challenging, and this challenge is compounded by low rain gauge
   densities and inhomogeneous monitoring networks. The dearth of
   observations is particularly problematic over the past decade, since the
   number of records in globally accessible archives has fallen
   precipitously. This lack of data coincides with an increasing scientific
   and humanitarian need to place recent seasonal and multi-annual East
   African precipitation extremes in a deep historic context. To serve this
   need, scientists from the UC Santa Barbara Climate Hazards Group and
   Florida State University have pooled their station archives and
   expertise to produce a high quality gridded ` Centennial Trends'
   precipitation dataset. Additional observations have been acquired from
   the national meteorological agencies and augmented with data provided by
   other universities. Extensive quality control of the data was carried
   out and seasonal anomalies interpolated using kriging. This paper
   documents the CenTrends methodology and data.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies have evaluated precipitation trends in Alaska and come
   to different conclusions. These studies differ in analysis period and
   methodology and do not address the issue of temporal homogeneity. To
   reconcile these conflicting results, we selected 29 stations with
   largely complete monthly records, screened them for homogeneity, and
   then evaluated trend over two analysis periods (1950-2010 and 1980-2010)
   using three methods: least absolute deviation regression, ordinary least
   squares regression (with and without transformation), and Mann-Kendall
   trend testing following removal of first-order autocorrelation. We found
   that differences in analytical period had a significant impact on trends
   and that the presence of inhomogeneities or step changes also posed a
   substantial challenge in detecting reliable long-term trends in
   precipitation over Alaska, particularly in the southern part of the
   state. Although some of these inhomogeneities occur in the mid-1970s and
   could be associated with well-documented changes in the Pacific Ocean
   and the Aleutian Low at that time, many of the inhomogeneities co-occur
   with changes in station location, instrumentation, or operation. These
   operationally induced changes make it difficult to accurately detect the
   impact of decadal to multidecadal climate variability on precipitation
   amounts and to assess historical precipitation trends in Alaska.},

Abstract = {This study applies a number of statistical techniques in an attempt to
   quantify the magnitude, and to determine the significance of trends in
   the number of rainy days and mean rainfall over Rwanda on a monthly,
   seasonal and annual timescale. Trend analysis of the number of rainy
   days (1961-1992) was performed on daily values collected from 25 weather
   stations and the rainfall trends (1935-1992) were analysed using
   aggregated mean monthly data from 28 weather stations. The magnitude and
   significance of trends at 95\% interval level derived from the slopes of
   the regression lines are presented spatially with the help of maps. It
   was observed that on average, there was a steady decline in the
   frequency of rainfall across the country. A significant incline was
   registered mainly over the northern region and the number of rainy days
   decreased significantly over the eastern and central plateau. The mean
   rainfall was found to increase sharply in most parts, especially in the
   regions around Kivu Lake during the short rainy seasons. The central
   region of Rwanda displayed a diminishing trend in rainfall totals in
   January and February. At the same time, the wet areas located in the
   highlands and around Kivu Lake are becoming wetter compared to the rest
   of the country. The highlands were consequently experiencing more
   flooding, with the eastern lowlands and the central plateau becoming
   warmer. These phenomena have an adverse effect on crop production, as
   they cause failure and/or destruction.},

Abstract = {Climate trends have been observed over the recent decades in many parts
   of the world, but current global climate models (GCMs) for seasonal
   climate forecasting often fail to capture these trends. As a result,
   model forecasts may be biased above or below the trendline. In our
   previous research, we developed a trend-aware forecast postprocessing
   method to overcome this problem. The method was demonstrated to be
   effective for embedding observed trends into seasonal temperature
   forecasts. In this study, we further develop the method for
   postprocessing GCM seasonal precipitation forecasts. We introduce new
   formulation and evaluation features to cater for special characteristics
   of precipitation amounts, such as having a zero lower bound and highly
   positive skewness. We apply the improved method to calibrate ECMWF SEAS5
   forecasts of seasonal precipitation for Australia. Our evaluation shows
   that the calibrated forecasts reproduce observed trends over the
   hindcast period of 36 years. In some regions where observed trends are
   statistically significant, forecast skill is greatly improved by
   embedding trends into the forecasts. In most regions, the calibrated
   forecasts outperform the raw forecasts in terms of bias, skill, and
   reliability. Wider applications of the new trend-aware postprocessing
   method are expected to boost user confidence in seasonal precipitation
   forecasts.},

Abstract = {While investigating linkages between afternoon peak rainfall amount and
   land-atmosphere coupling strength, a statistically significant trend in
   phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2)
   warm season (April-September) afternoon (1700-2259 UTC) precipitation
   was noted for a large fraction of the conterminous United States,
   namely, two-thirds of the area east of the Mississippi River, during the
   period from 1979 to 2015. To verify and better characterize this trend,
   a thorough statistical analysis is undertaken. The analysis focuses on
   three aspects of precipitation: amount, frequency, and intensity at
   6-hourly time scale and for each calendar month separately. At the
   NLDAS-2 native resolution of 0.125 degrees x 0.125 degrees, Kendall's
   tau and Sen's slope estimators are used to detect and estimate trends
   and the Pettitt test is used to detect breakpoints. Parallel analyses
   are conducted on both NARR and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for
   Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), subdaily precipitation
   estimates. Widespread breakpoints of field significance at the alpha =
   0.05 level are detected in the NLDAS-2 frequency and intensity series
   for all months and 6-h periods that are absent from the analogous NARR
   and MERRA-2 datasets. These breakpoints are shown to correspond with a
   July 1996 NLDAS-2 transition away from hourly 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees
   NOAA/CPC precipitation estimates to hourly 4-km stage II Doppler radar
   precipitation estimates in the temporal disaggregation of CPC daily
   gauge analyses. While NLDAS-2 may provide the most realistic diurnal
   precipitation cycle overall, users should be aware of this discontinuity
   and its direct effect on long-term trends in subdaily precipitation and
   indirect effects on trends in modeled soil moisture, surface
   temperature, surface energy and water fluxes, snow cover, snow water
   equivalent, and runoff/streamflow.},

Title = {Observed extreme precipitation trends and scaling in Central Europe},
Journal = {WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this publication we aim to relate observed changes in Central
   European extreme precipitation to the respective large-scale
   thermodynamic state of the atmosphere. Maxima of long-term (1901-2013)
   daily precipitation records from a densely sampled Central European
   station network, spanning Austria, Switzerland, Germany and the
   Netherlands, are scaled with Northern Hemispheric and regional
   temperature anomalies. Scaling coefficients are estimated at station
   level and aggregated to infer a robust regional extreme precipitation -
   temperature relationship. Across Central Europe, an overall
   intensification and a positive scaling signal with Northern Hemispheric
   temperature is detected in annual, summer, and winter single-day to
   monthly maximum precipitation. Generally, the estimates are consistent
   also when only considering data after 1950, and the scaling of annual
   maxima is also significant for all individual countries but Austria.
   However, scaling magnitudes are found to vary considerably between
   seasons and subregions. Also, scaling with regional temperature is
   non-significant, except for winter extreme precipitation.},

Journal = {ACTA SCIENTIARUM-TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Month = {JAN-DEC},
Abstract = {In recent decades, scientific and academic researchers around the world
   have been concerned with the assessment of regional and global climate
   trends. Under the hypothesis of the presence of climate change in
   Brazil, the aim of this work was to verify annual climate trends of
   maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation in 243 localities
   over all the Brazilian political regions. The data were obtained from
   National Institute of Meteorology. In this work there were identified
   and analysed trends in annual time series distributed between in 1961
   and 2017. The detections and analyses were performed by the application
   of the statistical tests of Mann-Kendall and the Pettitt to evaluate the
   presence of statistical trends. The statistical results and the trend
   distributions maps show that, from all the studied localities, for
   maximum temperature indicate increasing trends in 35\% of the series,
   decreasing trends in 1 and no trends in 64\%. The minimum temperature
   showed increasing trends in 30\% of the analysed series, decreasing in
   8\% and no trends in 63\%. The precipitation, showed increasing trends
   in 6\% of the studied series, decreasing in 4 and no trends in 91\%. The
   observed climate trends can be related to anthropological activities
   like urban spraw, industrial development and increasing population
   density.},

Abstract = {There is a great deal of interest in whether and how Alaska's
   precipitation is changing but little agreement in the existing
   peer-reviewed literature. To provide insight on this question, we have
   selected three commonly used 0.5 degrees resolution gridded
   precipitation products that have long-term monthly data coverage
   (Climatic Research Unit TS3.10.1, Global Precipitation Climatology
   Centre Full Data Reanalysis version 5, and University of Delaware
   version 2.01) and evaluated their homogeneity and trends with multiple
   methods over two periods, 1950-2008 and 1980-2008. All three data sets
   displayed common broadscale features of Alaska's precipitation
   climatology, but there were substantial differences between them in
   terms of average precipitation amount and interannual variability.
   Temporal inhomogeneity was a significant concern over Alaska in gridded
   precipitation products, as it was in the state's coastal weather
   stations. Although underlying station inhomogeneities were inherited to
   some extent by all of the gridded data sets, differences in data set
   construction contributed to dissimilarities in inhomogeneity, as well.
   There were contrasts in trends between the two time periods, and some
   minor discrepancies occurred as a function of the trend detection
   method, but the main disparities stemmed from choice of data set.
   Indeed, there were large areas where these data sets disagreed on both
   the sign and significance of precipitation trends. Until further
   analysis can resolve these differences, researchers using gridded
   precipitation data or evaluating studies based on such data should
   interpret results with extreme caution.},

Title = {Spurious Trends in High Latitude Southern Hemisphere Precipitation
   Observations},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {The high latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) is an important region for
   Earth's climate. Ocean heat content, cryosphere interactions, Antarctic
   bottom water development and the cloud-albedo feedbacks need to be
   understood to form a complete picture of the climate system. However,
   the high latitude SH is one of the most under-observed regions due to
   its remoteness. The advent of satellites and reanalyses have improved
   our monitoring of this region. Some previous studies observed an
   increase in precipitation over the SH high latitudes, however we argue
   that some of the trends in commonly used data sets may be artifacts. We
   use regression analysis of trends in precipitation and the Southern
   Annular Mode to contrast these relationships in satellite and reanalysis
   products, and to evaluate precipitation over the SH. We suggest that
   sensor changes and the lack of in situ data available for calibration
   may be responsible for unusual precipitation patterns especially around
   65 degrees S.
   Many important processes in the Earth's climate occur at high latitudes
   in the Southern Hemisphere. However, due to its remoteness and
   inhospitable conditions, scientists have trouble obtaining data for this
   region. Satellites have helped to provide information about this area
   but are not well constrained due to a lack of in situ data. Sensor
   changes and the launch of new satellites means that the data can vary in
   quality and reliability over time. By comparing precipitation trends
   over the Southern Hemisphere with known climate patterns, we suggest
   that an observed increase in precipitation over the Southern Hemisphere
   high latitudes may be due to variations in the satellite technology
   rather than a physical increase in precipitation. This is important for
   understanding the impacts of climate change on Earth's water cycle and
   heat storage.
   High latitude precipitation trends are likely artifacts Sensor changes
   may be responsible for spurious trends in the Southern Ocean Satellite
   products do not agree on the zonal mean precipitation pattern in the
   Southern Hemisphere},

Abstract = {There exists a need to document details related to the spatiotemporal
   climatology of precipitation over the Arabian Peninsula (Arabia) based
   on a sound assessment. Areal precipitation was calculated for Arabia,
   subtropical Arabia (STA), and tropical Arabia (TA) using a weighting
   scheme to adjust for latitudinal changes in grid-cell areas and extract
   statistics that have geographical/spatial interpretation based on a
   quality-controlled spatially-distributed precipitation dataset
   (1980-2019). Areal annual precipitation mean over Arabia (STA/TA) is
   88.61 mm (85.72/92.79). While boreal winter and spring seasons are the
   wet seasons over Arabia (29, 40\%) and STA (36, 40\%), boreal spring and
   summer are the wet seasons over TA (41, 25\%). Only 25\% of Arabia
   (STA/TA) receives more than 110.73 (108.48/113.73) mm of precipitation
   annually. Spatiotemporal trends were explored using the Mann-Kendall
   test, applied to trend free pre-whitened data, and the Theil-Sen
   estimator. Average areal precipitation over Arabia and STA is decreasing
   during the boreal winter and spring seasons at varying rates. On the
   other hand, boreal summer and fall precipitation is increasing over
   Arabia, STA, and TA with only that of TA summer being statistically
   significant. An elongated region extending from southwest to northeast
   has a statistically significant negative trend in annual, spring, and
   winter precipitation. The southern part of Arabia is dominated by
   positive trends in annual, summer, and fall precipitation with only
   isolated areas being statistically significant. The statistically
   significant decreasing trend in wet season precipitation over Arabia
   calls for more conservative water resource management strategies and
   bold adaptation measures.},

   studies. It appears that other influences cause the majority of the
   variance between the two datasets. The fact that the two datasets do not
   consistently agree, however, suggests that spuriously induced trends may
   be present in the NCDC Climate Division database.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {This study examines trends in the intensity and frequency of
   short-duration (5 min to 3 h) rainfall extremes in Hong Kong for the
   period of 1984 to 2010 and the drivers for the trends using gauge
   observations and gridded reanalysis. Both the intensity and frequency of
   rainfall extremes exhibit an upward trend, with the slope for the
   intensity (frequency) trend increasing (decreasing) as duration
   lengthens from 5 min to 3 h. The upward intensity (frequency) trends
   appear to be a manifestation of an abrupt change around 1991/1992
   (1992/1993) that separates a period of lower and fewer rainfall extremes
   before from a period of higher and more extremes after. The increase in
   Hong Kong's extreme rainfall after the early 1990s is likely caused by a
   combination of stronger rising motion along Southeast China Coasts and
   enhanced moisture transport into South China Sea resulting from the
   strengthening and westward shift of the western Pacific subtropical high
   associated with anomalous convective activities over the tropical
   western Indian Ocean and a positive phase circumglobal teleconnection
   wavetrain.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},

Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2223-2235},

Abstract = {In this study, trends in landfalling tropical cyclone (TC)-induced
   precipitation over China during 1980-2017 and the involved possible
   mechanisms are analyzed. Consistent with previous studies, it is found
   that the total annual TC precipitation shows a distinct spatial
   distribution with a significant increasing trend in southeastern China
   but a decreasing trend in southern China. This characteristic is found
   to be related to the increase in both the annual TC precipitation
   frequency and the precipitation intensity per TC over southeastern China
   but to the decrease in the annual TC precipitation frequency over
   southern China. A noticeable northward shift of total landfalling
   TC-induced annual precipitation has been identified. It is shown that
   the precipitation induced by strong TCs (STCs) significantly increased
   in southern China, whereas that induced by weak TCs (WTCs) increased in
   southeastern China, with the latter dominating the northward shift of
   total landfalling TC-induced precipitation over mainland China. The
   increasing trend of STC-induced precipitation in southern China is found
   to be closely related to sufficient water vapor supply and the increase
   in average duration and intensity of STCs after landfall. The increasing
   trend of WTC-induced precipitation in southeastern China is related to
   the northward shift of the average landfalling position of WTCs and
   changes in the environmental conditions that are more favorable for TC
   maintenance and precipitation.},

Abstract = {Exemplified by the Elbe river catchment, this is a study on how far
   certain meteorological phenomena occur simultaneously in the entire area

   precipitation for the 1951-2003 time period. It is demonstrated that the
   frequency of these events is increasing and closely linked to the
   development of certain Grosswetterlagen. The most striking development
   can be observed in summer with an increase in the number of days without
   precipitation from 85 (1951/1980) to 123 (1974/2003). This growth is
   strongly connected with an increase of the high pressure patterns HM and
   BM from 422 up to 532 in the same time period. In winter the cases of
   days with precipitation triple (from 13 to 39) parallel to an increase
   of the cyclonal Grosswetterlagen WZ and NWZ from 637 up to 806. A
   further result is the detection of the erratic nature of this
   development rather than it being a continuous trend.},

Title = {Effects of bias correction on precipitation trend over China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {112},
Number = {D13},
Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {Long-term monthly climatic data during 1951-1998 at 627 meteorological
   stations over China have been analysed in this study to examine the
   impact of bias corrections on monthly and yearly precipitation trends.
   The impacts of bias corrections on trends depended on the gauge catch
   efficiency and changes of wind speed, temperature, snow percentage, and
   number of trace and measurable precipitation days. Trends of corrected
   and measured monthly and yearly precipitation have similar regional
   patterns over China, although the trends are different quantitatively
   over some regions. Precipitation trends in summer months are generally
   higher than winter season because of high precipitation in summer and
   low in winter. For instance, trends in January and July are -8 to + 20
   mm/10a and -37 to + 55 mm/10a over China for the measured data during
   1951-1998, respectively. Bias corrections enhance monthly precipitation
   trends in every month by about 7 to 18\%, leading to an 8\% overall
   enhancement of absolute yearly precipitation trends over China. For the
   individual stations, the difference in corrected and measured annual
   precipitation trends varies from -4.1 to + 19.0 mm/10a (-5.0 to +
   1.7\%/10a) across China. It is important to note that bias corrections
   can change precipitation trend. Our analyses show that bias corrections
   have changed monthly and yearly precipitation trend direction from
   positive to negative over some regions in China. The trend changes
   reported here are large enough to affect regional climate and hydrology
   analyses, particularly over cold regions. More efforts are needed to
   quantify the impact of bias corrections on precipitation change analyses
   over other large countries and regions.},

Abstract = {The Tianshan Mountains, with their status as `water tower', receive
   quantities of precipitation that are among the highest in Central Asia.
   There are considerable knowledge gaps regarding the understanding of
   spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation over this water-scarce
   region. Based on the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data
   set, this study evaluated the precipitation variations over Tianshan
   Mountains on different time scales by using Mann-Kendall (M-K) test
   approaches and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method.
   The results show that (a) most parts of Tianshan experienced increasing
   annual precipitation during 1950-2016 while Western Tianshan, which is
   the wettest region, faced a downtrend of precipitation during the same
   67 years; (b) the annual precipitation in the Tianshan Mountains has
   exhibited high-frequency variations with 3- and 6-year quasi-periods and
   low-frequency variations with 12-, 27-year quasi-periods. On the decadal
   scale, Tianshan had two dry periods (1950-1962 and 1973-1984) and two
   wet periods (1962-1972 and 1985-2016) and has experienced a tendency of
   continuous humidification since 2004; (c) the precipitation over the
   Tianshan Mountains shows a strong seasonality. In total, 63.6\% of all
   precipitation falls in spring and summer. Distinctive differences are
   found in seasonal precipitation variations among the sub-Tianshan
   regions. Obvious upward trends of precipitation over Eastern Tianshan
   were found in all seasons, with Eastern Tianshan entering a humid period
   as early as 1986. Northern and Central Tianshan experienced a decreasing
   trend in summer and spring. However, in the other seasons, those two
   sub-Tianshan regions have been in humid periods since the 1990s. The
   precipitation over Western Tianshan showed an upward trend in summer and
   autumn. The obvious downward trends in spring and winter have led to dry
   periods in these two seasons from 1997-2014 to 2008-2016, respectively.},

Abstract = {Long-term monitoring of precipitation chemistry provides a great
   opportunity to examine the evolution of air pollutant emissions and
   effectiveness of air pollution control measures. We evaluated the
   characteristics and trends of precipitation chemistry at both annual and
   seasonal scales based on the records of 1994-2013 at Fushan Experimental
   Forest (FEF) of northeastern Taiwan. The results showed that 77\% of the
   weekly precipitation had pH < 5.0. The two-decadal average annual pH was
   4.62, without a significant inter-annual trend, possibly due to the
   concurrent declines of both acidic pollutants and base cations. There
   was a significant positive relationship between {[}SO42- + NO3-] and
   {[}Ca2+ + NH4+] indicating that their deposition was likely dominated by
   NH4NO3, (NH4)(2)SO4, Ca(NO3)(2), and CaSO4. There was a significant
   negative relationship between precipitation pH and the difference
   between {[}SO42- + NO3-] and {[}Ca2+ + NH4+], not just {[}SO42- + NO3-],
   suggesting that precipitation acidity was not solely determined by
   acidic pollutants but by the balance between acidic pollutants and base
   cations. We also found temporal decreases of Ca2+ and NH4+
   concentrations in precipitation which contributed to the low acid
   neutralization capacity of precipitation. Annual deposition of NO3- and
   SO42- was 23 and 55 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), which is much higher than most
   forest sites in the industrialized countries suggesting that acid
   deposition is still a major environmental issue in Taiwan. Annual
   deposition of NH4+, Ca2+ and NO3- showed significant decreasing trends
   during the 20-year period, which was mostly due to the decreases in the
   summer deposition associated with air pollution mitigation strategies.
   Winter deposition showed no decreasing patterns for the same period. The
   high contribution to annual acid deposition from autumn-winter and
   spring rains (50\%) associated with northeast monsoon implies that
   long-range transport of anthropogenic emissions from East Asia played a
   key role on acid depositions at FEF and possibly many areas in the
   region. Therefore, intergovernmental cooperation is urgently needed to
   effectively mitigate the threat of acid deposition in East Asia. (C)

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability of precipitation in Korea were
   investigated using 183 weather station data for 1973-2005. A set of 16
   indices that represent mean and extreme values of precipitation data
   were estimated using daily precipitation data, linear and spatial trend
   relationships of the indices were analysed using the Mann-Kendall test
   and Moran's I test statistic, respectively. Results demonstrate that
   annual precipitation data have a significant positive trend and there is
   a strong spatial relationship in their variability. The increase of
   annual precipitation is mainly associated with the increase of frequency
   and intensity of heavy precipitation during summer season. However,
   precipitation during spring and winter seasons had a decreasing trend.
   This variation of precipitation is likely to increase flood and drought
   risk. It means that the increase of annual precipitation should not be
   helpful for water resources management but could be a burden to river
   management and dam operation in Korea. Copyright. (C) 2010 Royal

Abstract = {In this study, the nature and causes for observed regional precipitation
   trends during 1977-2006 are diagnosed. It is found that major features
   of regional trends in annual precipitation during 1977-2006 are
   consistent with an atmospheric response to observed sea surface
   temperature (SST) variability. This includes drying over the eastern
   Pacific Ocean that extends into western portions of the Americas related
   to a cooling of eastern Pacific SSTs, and broad increases in rainfall
   over the tropical Eastern Hemisphere, including a Sahelian rainfall
   recovery and increased wetness over the Indo West Pacific related to
   North Atlantic and Indo West Pacific ocean warming. It is further
   determined that these relationships between SST and rainfall change are
   generally not symptomatic of human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases
   (GHGs) and aerosols. The intensity of regional trends simulated in
   climate models using observed time variability in green house gases,
   tropospheric sulfate aerosol, and solar and volcanic aerosol forcing are
   appreciably weaker than those observed and also weaker than those
   simulated in atmospheric models using only observed SST forcing. The
   pattern of rainfall trends occurring in response to such external
   radiative forcing also departs significantly from observations,
   especially a simulated increase in rainfall over the tropical Pacific
   and southeastern Australia that are opposite in sign to the actual
   drying in these areas.
   Additional experiments illustrate that the discrepancy between observed
   and GHG-forced rainfall changes during 1977-2006 results mostly from the
   differences between observed and externally forced SST trends. Only weak
   rainfall sensitivity is found to occur in response to the uniform
   distribution of SST warming that is induced by GHG and aerosol forcing,
   whereas the particular pattern of the observed SST change that includes
   an increased SST contrast between the east Pacific and the Indian Ocean,
   and strong regional warming of the North Atlantic Ocean, was a key
   driver of regional rainfall trends. The results of this attribution
   study on the causes for 1977-2006 regional rainfall changes are used to
   discuss prediction challenges including the likelihood that recent
   rainfall trends might persist.},

Abstract = {Ship present-weather reports from 1950 to 2019 are used to assess trends
   in the reporting of precipitation occurrence over the global oceans.
   Annual reported precipitation frequency shows statistically significant
   positive trends of up to \& SIM;15\% per decade throughout most ocean
   areas equatorward of 45 \& DEG;. However, latitudes poleward of 45 \&
   DEG; are dominated by negative trends, some areas of which meet the 95\%
   confidence threshold. Nine smaller regions were subjectively selected
   for further investigation, revealing that the observed trends, both
   positive and negative, are often but not always nearly linear, with the
   amplitude of interannual fluctuations usually being much larger than
   that expected from random sampling error alone. The annual time series
   reveal that four comparatively dry areas are associated with the largest
   overall positive trends, ranging from 8.3\% to 12.8\% (relative) per
   decade. Trends were also computed separately for each season, revealing
   remarkable overall consistency in trends across seasons.},

Abstract = {Rainfall extreme value analysis provides information that has been
   crucial in characterizing risk, designing successful infrastructure
   systems, and ultimately protecting people and property from the threat
   of rainfall-induced flooding. However, in the Houston region recent
   events (such as the unprecedented rainfall wrought by Hurricane Harvey)
   have highlighted the inability of existing analyses to accurately
   characterize current climate conditions. Specifically, there has been
   little research investigating how spatial patterns of extreme
   precipitation have shifted through time in the Texas Gulf Coast region,
   which has led to mis-characterization of existing
   intensity-duration-frequency curves. This study investigates
   spatiotemporal trends in extreme precipitation in southeast Texas using
   a statistical approach for peaks-over-threshold modeling that employs a
   generalized Pareto distribution. Precipitation data from over 600 rain
   gauges across the region are analyzed in 40-year time windows to
   evaluate shifts in distribution parameters and extreme rainfall levels
   through time. Spatial analysis of these trends focuses on highlighting
   regions with increasing, stationary, and decreasing extreme rainfall
   through time. Results demonstrate heterogeneity in spatiotemporal trends
   across the entire study region, but significant increases in extreme
   rainfall over the Houston urban area. Spatial analysis of these trends
   focuses on how extreme rainfall has changed within different watersheds.
   Return level estimates of extreme rainfall values are also compared to
   the current standards for Harris County. Results from this study
   identify areas that have experienced significant shifts in extreme
   rainfall, and can help inform where design standards may be inaccurate
   or outdated.},

Abstract = {In hydrology, research of changes in precipitation is of particular
   interest, because precipitation directly affects runoff and its
   spatial-temporal distribution. We analysed how changes in the frequency
   of occurrence (number of days per season or year) of the Alpine Weather
   Types (AWTs) by SCHUEPP (1968) may influence seasonal and annual
   precipitation amounts and the interannual variability over Switzerland.
   This analysis included a comparison of trends both in precipitation
   amounts and frequencies of the AWTs. Since 1901 they have shown in the
   northern part of the Swiss Alps a significant increase in the
   precipitation amounts in winter and in the whole year, while
   precipitation in spring became more variable there. The annual
   frequencies of AWTs shifted towards more convective and less advective
   ones. However, the increasing trends in the convective weather types
   during spring and summer may be the result of inhomogeneities in the
   time series. To explain the observed changes in precipitation amounts,
   the changes both in frequency and precipitation-productivity (average
   amount of precipitation per weather type) of the AWTs were used: The
   former mainly explain changes within the convective AWTs, the latter
   within the advective ones. The significant increase of variability in
   spring precipitation can be explained by increased variability of
   productivity within the AWTs. It was shown that changes both in the
   frequencies of the AWT and in their precipitation-productivity are
   important to explain the observed changes in precipitation amounts.
   However, none of them could be identified as the key factor in all
   seasons and regions. Moreover, the driving forces behind the observed
   changes in the AWTs still remain unclear.},

Abstract = {Human influence on climate has been detected in surface air
   temperature(1-5), sea level pressure(6), free atmospheric
   temperature(7), tropopause height(8) and ocean heat content(9).
   Human-induced changes have not, however, previously been detected in
   precipitation at the global scale(10-12), partly because changes in
   precipitation in different regions cancel each other out and thereby
   reduce the strength of the global average signal(13-19). Models suggest
   that anthropogenic forcing should have caused a small increase in global
   mean precipitation and a latitudinal redistribution of precipitation,
   increasing precipitation at high latitudes, decreasing precipitation at
   sub-tropical latitudes(15,18,19), and possibly changing the distribution
   of precipitation within the tropics by shifting the position of the
   Intertropical Convergence Zone(20). Here we compare observed changes in
   land precipitation during the twentieth century averaged over
   latitudinal bands with changes simulated by fourteen climate models. We
   show that anthropogenic forcing has had a detectable influence on
   observed changes in average precipitation within latitudinal bands, and
   that these changes cannot be explained by internal climate variability
   or natural forcing. We estimate that anthropogenic forcing contributed
   significantly to observed increases in precipitation in the Northern
   Hemisphere mid-latitudes, drying in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics
   and tropics, and moistening in the Southern Hemisphere subtropics and
   deep tropics. The observed changes, which are larger than estimated from
   model simulations, may have already had significant effects on
   ecosystems, agriculture and human health in regions that are sensitive
   to changes in precipitation, such as the Sahel.},

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability of daily precipitation in
   Central-Southern Chile (-30-46 degrees S), considering 176
   meteorological stations for the period of 1965-2015, was analysed by
   mean of the concentration index (CI). The CI was calculated for the
   complete period, for the wet season and year-to-year, for each
   meteorological station. In addition, the trends were computed for the
   whole period by locations and by moving windows for the complete
   territory. The CI values range from 0.502 to 0.755, agreeing with
   previous works in the Mediterranean area and marine west coast climates.
   Linear correlations have been established between both year and wet
   season CI values with geographical factors, such as latitude, longitude
   and elevation. These correlations are statistically significant for the
   yearly CI with latitude and longitude, with - 0.38 and - 0.39 Pearson's
   r values respectively (p-values lower than 0.001). However, the semiarid
   climates in Chile do not show the same behaviour as those presented in
   other regions of the world. The trends show an increase in the
   concentration of the whole series (mainly in the marine west coast
   climates) within the period between 1976 and 1994 with higher CI values,
   linked to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.},

Abstract = {This study examines precipitation accumulation and intensity trends
   across a region in southwest Saudi Arabia characterized by distinct
   seasonal weather patterns and mountainous terrain. The region is an
   example of an arid/semiarid area faced with maintaining sustainable
   water resources with a growing population. Annual and seasonal trends in
   precipitation amount were examined from 29 rain gages divided among four
   geographically unique regions from 1945/1946 to 2009. Two of the regions
   displayed significantly declining annual trends over the time series
   using a Mann-Kendall test modified for autocorrelation (alpha < 0.05).
   Seasonal analysis revealed insignificant declining trends in at least
   two of the regions during each season. The largest and most consistent
   declining trends occurred during wintertime where all regions
   experienced negative trends. Several intensity metrics were examined in
   the study area from four additional stations containing daily data from
   1985 to 2011. Intensity metrics included total precipitation, wet day
   count, simple intensity index, maximum daily annual rainfall, and
   upper/lower precipitation distribution changes. In general, no coherent
   trends were found among the daily stations suggesting precipitation is
   intensifying across the study area. The work represents the first of its
   size in the study area, and one of few in the region due to the lack of
   available long-term data needed to properly examine precipitation
   changes.},

Abstract = {Scientific evidence on climate changes at global level has gained
   increasing interest in the scientific community in general. The impacts
   of climate change as well as anthropogenic actions may cause errors in
   hydro-agricultural projects existent in the watershed under study. This
   study aimed to identify the presence or absence of trend in total annual
   precipitation series of the watershed of the Mirim Lagoon, state of Rio
   Grande do Sul-RS/Brazil/Uruguay (Brazilian side) as well as to detect
   the period in which they occurred. For that, it was analyzed the
   precipitation data belonging to 14 weather stations. To detect the
   existence of monotonic trend and change points, it was used the
   nonparametric tests of Mann-Kendall and Mann-Whitney, the ``t{''} test
   of Student for two samples of unpaired data (parametric), as well as the
   technique of progressive mean. The Weather Station 3152014 (Pelotas)
   presented changes in the trend in the series of annual precipitation in
   the period from 1953 to 2007. The methodologies that use subdivided
   series were more efficient in detecting change in trend when compared
   with the Mann-Kendall test, which uses the complete series (from 1921 to
   2007).},

Abstract = {Spatial patterns of monthly, seasonal and annual precipitation over Iran
   and the corresponding long-term trends for the period 1951-2009 are
   investigated using the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre gridded
   dataset. Results suggest that the spatial patterns of annual, winter and
   spring precipitation and the associated coefficients of variation
   reflect the role of orography and latitudinal extent between
   central-southern arid and semi-arid regions and northern and western
   mountainous areas. It is also shown that precipitation occurrence is
   almost regularly distributed within the year in northern areas while it
   is more concentrated in a few months in southern Iran. The spatial
   distribution of Mann-Kendal trend test (Z statistics) for annual
   precipitation showed downward trend in north-western and south-eastern
   Iran, whereas western, central and north-eastern exhibited upward trend,
   though not statistically significant in most regions. Results for winter
   and autumn revealed upward trend in most parts of the country, with the
   exception of north-western and south-eastern where a downward trend is
   observed; in spring and summer, a downward trend seems to prevail in
   most of Iran. However, for all seasons the areas where the detected
   trend is statistically significant are limited to a few spot regions.
   The overall results suggest that the precipitation is decreasing in
   spring and summer and increasing in autumn and winter in most of Iran,
   i.e. less precipitation during the warm season with a consequent
   intensification of seasonality and dryness of the country. However,
   since the detected trends are often not statistically significant, any
   stringent conclusion cannot be done on the future tendencies.},

Abstract = {The analyses of the spatial and temporal trends of precipitation are
   pertinent for the future development and sustainable management of water
   resources of a given region. Annual and seasonal precipitation data from
   28 synoptic stations of Iran (1967-2006) were analyzed to determine the
   spatial and temporal trends and approximate year of the beginning of the
   significant trends by using the Mann-Kendall and Mann-Kendall rank
   statistic tests, respectively. The trend free pre-whitening (TFPW)
   method was applied to eliminate the influence of serial correlation on
   the Mann-Kendall test, and the magnitude of the precipitation trends was
   obtained from the Theil-Sen's slope estimator. Over the 40-year period,
   negative trend in annual precipitation occurred at 22 sites (79\%),
   while just three sites had statistically significant (alpha = 0.05)
   negative trend in precipitation. The magnitude of the significant
   negative trends of annual precipitation at the 95\% confidence level
   varied from (-)2.53 +/- 0.69 mm/year at Tabriz station to (-)3.43 +/-
   0.81 mm/year at Khoy station. The change points of the annual
   precipitation at Khoy, Oroomieh and Tabriz stations were 1982, 1994 and
   1981, respectively. In the seasonal series, the negative trends in
   spring and winter precipitation were larger compared with those in the
   other seasonal series, so that, five significant negative trends were
   detected in the winter time series. A noticeable decrease in the winter
   precipitation series was observed mostly in northern Iran, as well as
   along the coasts of the Caspian Sea. In summer precipitation, two
   significant positive trends were found at Mashhad and Torbateheydarieh
   stations, whereas no significant positive or negative trends were
   detected by the trend tests in autumn precipitation. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective
   Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) precipitation product in
   reproducing the trend and distribution of extreme precipitation events.
   Utilizing the extreme value theory, time-invariant and time-variant
   extreme value distributions are developed to model the trends and
   changes in the patterns of extreme precipitation events over the
   contiguous United States during 1979-2010. The Climate Prediction Center
   (CPC) U.S. Unified gridded observation data are used as the
   observational dataset. The CPC analysis shows that the eastern and
   western parts of the United States are experiencing positive and
   negative trends in annual maxima, respectively. The continental-scale
   patterns of change found in MERRA seem to reasonably mirror the observed
   patterns of change found in CPC. This is not previously expected, given
   the difficulty in constraining precipitation in reanalysis products.
   MERRA tends to overestimate the frequency at which the 99th percentile
   of precipitation is exceeded because this threshold tends to be lower in
   MERRA, making it easier to be exceeded. This feature is dominant during
   the summer months. MERRA tends to reproduce spatial patterns of the
   scale and location parameters of the generalized extreme value and
   generalized Pareto distributions. However, MERRA underestimates these
   parameters, particularly over the Gulf Coast states, leading to lower
   magnitudes in extreme precipitation events. Two issues in MERRA are
   identified: 1) MERRA shows a spurious negative trend in Nebraska and
   Kansas, which is most likely related to the changes in the satellite
   observing system over time that has apparently affected the water cycle
   in the central United States, and 2) the patterns of positive trend over
   the Gulf Coast states and along the East Coast seem to be correlated
   with the tropical cyclones in these regions. The analysis of the trends
   in the seasonal precipitation extremes indicates that the hurricane and
   winter seasons are contributing the most to these trend patterns in the
   southeastern United States. In addition, the increasing annual trend
   simulated by MERRA in the Gulf Coast region is due to an incorrect trend
   in winter precipitation extremes.},

Abstract = {Global climate change can have significant impacts on different
   geographical regions. It is very important to analyze the changes in
   temporal and spatial precipitation patterns. In this study, the monthly
   and yearly precipitation values in Turkey were examined by combining the
   nonparametric Mann-Kendall rank correlation test and Getis-Ord G spatial
   clustering test. The study was carried out by integrating and compiling
   the data in different formats related to the years 1969-2018 for 233
   stations in Turkey. It was observed that the annual total precipitation
   amounts had decreased significantly in many stations during the studied
   period. Though most of the stations show a decreasing trend in annual
   precipitation, only the inner and southern part of the country has
   significant decreasing trends. The trend analysis on monthly
   precipitation data reveals that there are significant (confidence level
   >= 95\%) decreasing trends in most of the regions of Turkey.},

Abstract = {The frequency and the severity of extreme weather events are increasing
   globally and will continue to do so in the coming decades as a
   consequence of our changing climate. Understanding the characteristics
   of these events is crucial due to their significant negative impacts on
   social, physical and economic environments. In this study, 14 extreme
   rainfall indices are determined and examined in terms of trends and
   statistical characteristics for the four meteorological stations located
   in the Thrace region of Turkey, namely Edirne, Tekirdag, Kirklareli and
   Sariyer (Istanbul). The results indicate that annual total precipitation
   has an increasing trend for the Kirklareli and Sariyer stations (z =
   1.730 and z = 2.127) and a decreasing trend for the Edirne and Tekirdag
   stations (z = - 0.368 and z = - 0.401). However, the precipitation
   intensity indices (SDII) of all stations show increasing trends that are
   statistically significant for the Edirne and Kirklareli stations. The
   Kirklareli station tends to have more days with heavy, very heavy and
   extremely heavy rainfall events (z = 2.241, z = 2.076 and z = 1.684,
   respectively). It is also anticipated that maximum amount of rainfalls
   in daily and consecutive five- and ten-day time scales will probably
   increase at all stations. Moreover, rainfall from very wet days and
   extremely wet days and fraction of total wet day rainfall that comes
   from very wet days and extremely wet days indices also show increasing
   trend tendencies for all stations. The remarkable point is the
   decreasing total precipitation trend at the Edirne and Tekirdag
   stations, contrary to the Kirklareli and Sariyer stations, which
   indicates that the annual total precipitation does not necessarily
   depend on extreme precipitation for the analyzed period.},

Title = {Precipitation Trends over Slovakia in the Period 1981-2013},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The objective of this paper was to analyze the temporal and spatial
   trends in annual and seasonal precipitation in Slovakia utilizing 487
   gauging station data collected statewide in the period from 1981 to
   2013. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical test, which has
   been widely used to assess the significance of trends in hydrological
   time series, was applied to detect the significant trends. The Theil-Sen
   (TS) approach was applied to quantify the trend magnitude, and the
   Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test was used to detect abrupt temporal
   trend shifts. In general, precipitation data in the study area have not
   changed during the last 33 years, and there are no big gaps. However,
   predominantly increasing trends in precipitation time series were found
   at most of the gauging stations in Slovakia. The results corroborate
   previous climatic studies in the area of central Europe. In Slovakia,
   there is evidence of different rain distribution from the monthly point
   of view. Decreasing trends were detected in December in the northern
   part of Slovakia, while the central and southern parts revealed
   increasing trends. Most of the stations showed increasing summer
   precipitation trends, especially in July. It is expected that the
   findings of this comprehensive study of precipitation trends over
   Slovakia will produce more insights for the understanding of the
   regional hydrological behavior in Slovakia over the last several
   decades.},

Title = {Spatial correlation in precipitation trends in the Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {A geostatistical analysis of variables derived from Amazon daily
   precipitation records (trends in annual precipitation totals, trends in
   annual maximum precipitation accumulated over 1-5 days, trend in length
   of dry spell, trend in number of wet days per year) gave results that
   are consistent with those previously reported. Averaged over the
   Brazilian Amazon region as a whole, trends in annual maximum
   precipitations were slightly negative, the trend in the length of dry
   spell was slightly positive, and the trend in the number of wet days in
   the year was slightly negative. For trends in annual maximum
   precipitation accumulated over 1-5 days, spatial correlation between
   trends was found to extend up to a distance equivalent to at least half
   a degree of latitude or longitude, with some evidence of anisotropic
   correlation. Time trends in annual precipitation were found to be
   spatially correlated up to at least ten degrees of separation, in both
   W-E and S-N directions. Anisotropic spatial correlation was strongly
   evident in time trends in length of dry spell with much stronger
   evidence of spatial correlation in the W-E direction, extending up to at
   least five degrees of separation, than in the S-N. Because the time
   trends analyzed are shown to be spatially correlated, it is argued that
   methods at present widely used to test the statistical significance of
   climate trends over time lead to erroneous conclusions if spatial
   correlation is ignored, because records from different sites are assumed
   to be statistically independent.},

   Modulations of .lambda. values (hence the eco-zones) appear to be

   suggested that this notwithstanding, irreversible trends in land-surface
   degradation are mainly due to uncontrolled human interference in
   relation to large-scale agriculture in areas where .lambda. less than
   0.40 in the Sudan-Shael belt of Nigeria. This needs to be re-apprasied,

Abstract = {This paper analyses the daily precipitation data recorded for the last
   75-80 years in SE Spain. Prior to statistical analysis, homogeneity
   tests were performed to determine the usefulness of the data (recorded
   in six pluviometric stations). If the data were homogeneous, the
   Mann-Kendall test was performed to detect monotonic trends for variables
   such as total precipitation, number of days with precipitation greater
   than 1, 20 or 40 mm, number of consecutive dry days and number of
   consecutive wet days. Moreover, the linear tendency was calculated and
   accepted (or rejected) by performing a Student's t-test of the
   calculated residual values. The results showed, on average, a clear
   change in precipitation patterns for the last 20 years. Annual rainfall
   had decreased, with values ranging from 0 to 15\%, dry periods had
   increased in length, and the number of rainy days had decreased
   (especially when high daily precipitation was considered). This latter
   notion did not exactly concur with the conclusions of the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2014 Synthesis Report
   related to the study area.},

Abstract = {There are trend identification methodologies in the literature but they
   have three crucial points that should be cared with great attention in
   practical applications. These points are that the available time series
   should have independent serial correlation structure, Gaussian (normal)
   distribution and monotonic trend fitting to whole time series through
   the least square technique. The existing methods consider the whole
   duration of the time series and try to identify a monotonic trend in
   increasing or decreasing forms. This paper presents partial trend
   methodology as an innovative and simple trend identification method,
   which yields low, medium and high cluster trends separately. It provides
   the opportunity to segregate between the low, high and medium flow
   trends and their relative intensities, durations as well as magnitudes.
   The application of the partial trend methodology is presented for 7
   precipitation stations from 7 different sub-climatic regions of Turkey
   leading to spatial and temporal trend interpretations.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes data from 113 Venezuelan monthly precipitation
   stations for recent years. The data come from the climatic network from
   the Venezuelan Guayana Coorporation- Caroni Electrification
   (CVG-EDELCA), the Venezuelan Air Force (FAV), and the Ministry of
   Environment and Natural Resources (MARN). An homogeneity test is carried
   out by using Alexandersson's test (Alexandersson 1986) to detect
   locations with important changes in the mean, which are not part of the
   natural climate variability. Linear models with a trend component, a
   seasonal component and auto-regressive errors are fitted by using
   Generalized Least Squares. Different models are compared to determine
   whether the trend component should be included within the model, as well
   as the seasonal component with one or two harmonics, depending on
   whether the precipitation presents a single or two modes along the year.
   The Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) is used for model selection. The
   estimated trend values and the significance of the trend component are
   spatially represented. It is found that in the northern coastal region
   and most of the Andean region precipitation trends are negative. On the
   contrary, southeast of Bolivar state presents a positive trend. However,
   the model trend component is not significant for most locations.
   Moreover, the seasonal pattern is best represented with a model with two
   harmonics, given the seasonal characteristics of the analyzed locations.},

Abstract = {It is known from present-day climates that both temporal and spatial
   variations in precipitation can be more pronounced than those in
   temperature and thus influence ecosystems and human society in more
   substantial way. However, very little is known about such variations in
   the past. Here we present an analysis of 206 palaeoprecipitation data
   from two twelve million year long proxy records of precipitation for
   Southwest (Calatayud-Teruel basin) and Central Europe (Western and
   Central Paratethys), spanning the late Early and Middle to Late Miocene
   (17.8-5.3 Ma) at a temporal resolution of about 80 kyr and 200 kyr,
   respectively. The estimates of precipitation are based on the
   ecophysiological structure of herpetological assemblages. The results
   show that precipitation variations in both regions have large amplitudes
   during the Miocene with comparable temporal trends at longer time
   scales. With locally 300 mm up to more than 1000 mm more rainfall per
   year than present, the early Langhian and the Tortonian were relatively
   wet periods, whereas the late Langhian and late Serravallian were
   relatively dry, with up to 300 to 500 mm less precipitation than
   present. The most humid time intervals were the early and middle
   Tortonian washhouse climate periods. Overall, our data suggest that the
   latitudinal precipitation gradient in Europe from the Middle to Late
   Miocene were highly variable, with a general tendency towards a reduced
   gradient relative to present day values. The gradient decreases during
   cooling periods and increases during warming periods, similar to results
   from simulations of future climate change. Interestingly, the
   precipitation gradient was reversed during the second washhouse climate
   period and the Early Messinian, which may have causes a negative
   hydrologic balance in the Eastern Paratethys during the latter time.
   Yet, our reconstructed gradient curve shows no direct correlation with
   the global temperature signal from oxygen isotopes, which implies a
   non-linear regional response. Our results further suggest that major
   fluctuations in the precipitation gradient can be responsible for shifts
   in ecosystem distribution, and particularly, for faunal turnover in
   South Western Europe. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Rainfall regime changes and trends in Botswana Kalahari Transect's late

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {116},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Sixty-year-long January-March (JFM) rainfall data from four (4) stations
   along the Kalahari Transect were analyzed for long-term trends and
   abrupt changes in rainfall regimes. On average, JFM rainfall accounts
   for more than 50 \% of annual rainfall in the region. Mann-Kendall trend
   test has shown an insignificant heterogeneous trend in the seasonal
   rainfall of -1.097, 0.029, -0.407, and -1.327 mm/year for Maun, Ghanzi,
   Tsabong, and Tshane, respectively. An abrupt change in rainfall regimes
   in these areas was investigated and was found to occur in the year 1982
   for all stations. The change is related to large-scale atmospheric
   circulations. Analysis of large-scale atmospheric circulations before
   1982 over the region has shown the formation of a tropical low pressure
   convective system over the Kalahari Transect. The tropical system
   shifted eastward after 1982 to be centered over southeastern southern
   Africa with a significant reduction in rainfall over the Kalahari. A
   direct impact of this is the livestock-induced overgrazing which has
   lead to excessive removal of palatable herbaceous species thereby giving
   woody species, such as Accacia mellifera and Grewia flava, a competitive
   edge for dominance in the ecosystems. Seed production of A. mellifera
   depends on rainfall; therefore, abrupt changes in rainfall regimes
   impact livelihood and eco-tourism industry. The correlation studies
   between rainfall anomalies and NINO3.4 indices show a reduction in the
   influence of El-Nio Southern Oscillation on the Kalahari Transect
   rainfall after 1982.},

Title = {Trends in Extreme Precipitation Indices in Iran: 1951-2007},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {We investigate trends in extreme precipitation in Iran for 1951-2007
   using the recently released APHRODITE daily rainfall time series. We
   find that seven different indices of extreme precipitation all show an
   upward trend through the study period. The seven different precipitation
   indices include annual precipitation total, number of days above a
   certain threshold, maximum precipitation received over a certain period
   of time, maximum one-day precipitation, and number of days with
   precipitation above the 90th percentile. A principal components analysis
   reveals one eigenvector explaining much of the variance in the seven
   indices and reveals that this component exhibits a strong upward trend
   for the whole of Iran. On a regional level, we find that the upward
   trend in extreme precipitation has a strong southwest-to-northeast
   gradient across the country for all the indices. We repeated all the
   analyses for 42 stations across the country to compare with the results
   from the gridded data; trends in extreme rainfall generated from the
   station data compare favorably with the results from the APHRODITE daily
   rainfall time series thereby reinforcing the robustness of our
   conclusions.},

Abstract = {This study aims to identify spatial and temporal precipitation trends by
   analyzing eight extreme climate indices of rainfall in the High Basin of
   the Cauca River in Southwestern Colombia from 1970 to 2013. The relation
   between historical floods and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is
   also analyzed. Results indicate that in general, the reduction of
   precipitation, especially in the center of the basin with negative
   annual and seasonal trends in intensity indices, namely, the annual
   maximum 1-day precipitation amount (RX1day) and annual maximum 5-day
   precipitation amount (RX5day). Sixty-four percentage of the stations
   exhibit an increasing trend in September-October-November in the
   consecutive dry days. In December-January-February interval, positive
   trends in most of the stations is noted for total precipitation and for
   the number of wet days with rainfall greater than or equal to 1 mm. The
   findings also show that sea surface temperature (SST) in the equatorial
   Pacific is statistically correlated (r) with indices of extreme
   precipitation (r -0.40). However, the effect of ENSO is evident with a
   time lag of 2-3 months. These results are relevant for forecasting
   floods on a regional scale, since changes in SST of the equatorial
   Pacific may take place 2-3 months ahead of the basin inundation. Our
   results contribute to the understanding of extreme rainfall events,
   hydrological hazard forecasts and climate variability in the Colombian
   Andes.},

Abstract = {West Africa includes a semi-arid zone between the Sahara Desert and the
   humid Gulf of Guinea coast, approximately between 10 degrees N and 20
   degrees N, which is irrigated by summer monsoon rains. This article
   refers to the region as the Sahel. Rain-fed agriculture is the primary
   sustenance for Sahel populations, and severe droughts (in the 1970s and
   1980s), therefore, have devastating negative societal impacts. The
   future frequency of Sahel droughts and the evolution of its hydrological
   balance are therefore of great interest. The article reviews 10 recent
   research studies that attempt to discover how climate changes will
   affect the hydrology of the Sahel throughout the 21st century. All 10
   studies rely on atmosphere-ocean global climate model (AOGCM)
   simulations based on a range of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Many
   of the simulations are contained in the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change archives for Assessment Reports \#3 and \#4. Two of the
   studies use AOGCM data to drive regional climate models. Seven studies
   make projections for the first half of the 21st century and eight
   studies make projections for the second half. Some studies make
   projections of wetter conditions and some predict more frequent
   droughts, and each describes the atmospheric processes associated with
   its prediction. Only one study projects more frequent droughts before
   2050, and that is only for continent-wide degradation in vegetation
   cover. The challenge to correctly simulate Sahel rainfall decadal trends
   is particularly daunting because multiple physical mechanisms compete to
   drive the trend upwards or downwards. A variety of model deficiencies,
   regarding the simulation of one or more of these physical processes,
   taints models' climate change projections. Consequently, no consensus
   emerges regarding the impact of anticipated greenhouse gas forcing on
   the hydrology of the Sahel in the second half of the 21st century.

Title = {Changes in air temperature, but not in precipitation, determine
   long-term trends in water chemistry of high mountain lakes of the Alps
   with and without rock glacier influence},

Abstract = {Climate change has strongly affected lakes around the world, but the
   relative effects of warmer air temperatures and changing precipitation
   on the water chemistry of alpine systems are not well understood. Here
   we tested the effect of monthly and seasonal climate on the water
   chemistry of six high mountain lakes located in the Alps. From 1982 to
   2020, water samples were collected annually from different depths during
   the autumn mixing. We observed a simultaneous increase in electrical
   conductivity, ionic content, and pH with air temperature. In lakes with
   rock glacier influence, the increase in conductivity, ionic content, and
   especially in sulfate was even more pronounced, but accompanied by a
   strong decrease in pH. These differences are attributed to the direct
   influence of acidic meltwater from active rock glaciers in catchments
   with acidic bedrock. We then analyzed changes in lake chemistry, taking
   into account seasonal trends in air temperature and precipitation, using
   redundancy analysis. Temperature increase significantly affected water
   chemistry in five of the six lakes, especially at times of ice breakup.
   Increasing warming explained 17\% to 32\% of the changes in electrical
   conductivity, alkalinity, pH, major ions, and nitrogen. In contrast,
   precipitation had little effect on the changes of those parameters.
   Nevertheless, late spring snowfall and high snowfall in early fall,
   which result in prolonged ice cover, had a dampening effect on the
   impact of climate warming on lake chemistry. Our results confirm that
   climate warming remains a major driver of chemical changes in alpine
   lakes, but provide new evidence that late spring temperatures are the
   most important triggers.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the possible effects of climate change on
   temperature and precipitation variables in the Eastern Black Sea Basin,
   Turkiye's wettest and flood-prone region. The outputs of three GCMs
   under historical, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios were downscaled to
   regional scale using the multivariate adaptive regression splines
   method. The future monthly temperature and precipitation for 12 stations
   in the basin were projected for three periods: the 2030s (2021-2050),
   2060s (2051-2080), and 2090s (2081-2100). In addition to relative
   changes, high and low groups and intra-period trends were analyzed for
   the first time using innovative methods. For the pessimistic scenario,
   an increase of 3.5 degrees C in the interior and 3.0 degrees C in the
   coastal areas of the basin is projected. For the optimistic scenario,
   these values are expected to be 2.5 and 2.0 degrees C, respectively. A
   decrease in precipitation is projected for the interior region, and a
   significant increase is expected for the eastern and coastal areas of
   the basin, especially in spring. This result indicates that floods will
   occur frequently coastal areas of the basin in the coming periods. Also,
   although the monotonic trends of temperatures during periods are higher
   than precipitation in interior regions, these regions may have more
   uncertainty as their trends are in different directions of low and high
   groups of different scenarios and GCMs and contribute to all trends,
   especially precipitation.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study was to investigate the trends on
   average and extreme events in time series of daily precipitation from
   1980 to 2010 in the Parana River basin, Brazil. The nonparametric
   Mann-Kendall test was applied to detect monotonic trend in the
   precipitation series. The occurrence of extreme values was analysed
   based on three generalized extreme values (GEV) models: Model 1
   (stationary), Model 2 (non-stationary for location parameter), and Model
   3 (non-stationary for location and scale parameters). The GEV parameters
   were estimated by the Generalized Maximum Likelihood method (GMLE) and
   for the non-stationary models, the parameters were estimated as linear
   functions of time. To choose the most suitable model, the maximum
   likelihood ratio test (D) was used. From the results observed at the
   monthly scale, it was possible to infer that the months with the highest
   probability of an extreme weather event occurrence are February
   (climates Aw and Cfa), July (Cfa and Cfb), and October (Aw, Cfa, and
   Cfb). Approximately 90\% of the 1,112 stations presented no trend
   regarding the GEV parameters. The non-stationarity showed by other
   stations (Models 2 and 3) might be associated with several factors, such
   as the alteration of land use due to the north expansion of the
   agricultural border of the Parana River basin.},

Abstract = {The climate variability analysis is often performed by studying trends
   in hydro-climatic series. In this study, precipitation series trend
   analysis was performed by applying the parametric test of linear
   regression and the non-parametric tests of Mann-Kendall (MK) and
   Pettitt's. Trend tests were applied on the original precipitation series
   and the denoised precipitation series via the discrete wavelet transform
   (DWT). This study aims- to evaluate the classical and new approaches
   used for analyzing precipitation trends. The paper presents a new
   approach for analyzing non-significant trends by combining Pettitt's
   test, linear regression, and discrete wavelet transforms. The most
   effective periodic component of the time series was determined, and
   precipitation series were transformed for a short-term periodicity scale
   (2-years). The trend analysis results obtained from the denoised
   precipitation series had presented more significant results than those
   of the original series.},

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},

Pages = {3235-3250},
Abstract = {In this study, the trends and variability of annual precipitation totals
   and annual rain days over land within the Mediterranean region are
   analyzed. Long term ground-based observations concerning, on one hand,
   monthly precipitation totals (1900-2010) and rain days (1965-2010) from
   40 meteorological stations within the Mediterranean region were obtained
   from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service and the World Climate
   Data and Monitoring Programme (WCDMP) of the World Meteorological
   Organization. On the other hand, high spatial resolution (0.5 degrees x
   0.5 degrees) gridded monthly data CRU TS 3.1 were acquired from the
   Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, for the period
   1901-2009. The two datasets were compared by means of trends and
   variability, while the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
   in the Mediterranean precipitation was examined. In the process, the
   climatic changes in the precipitation regime between the period
   1961-1990 (reference period) and the period 2071-2100 (future climate)
   were presented using climate model simulations (RACMO2.1/KNMI). The
   future climate projections were based on SRES A1B.
   The findings of the analysis showed that statistically significant (95\%
   confidence level) negative trends of the annual precipitation totals
   exist in the majority of Mediterranean regions during the period
   1901-2009, with an exception of northern Africa, southern Italy and
   western Iberian peninsula, where slight positive trends (not
   statistically significant at 95\% CL) appear. Concerning the annual
   number of rain days, a pronounced decrease of 20\%, statistically
   significant (95\% confidence level), appears in representative
   meteorological stations of east Mediterranean, while the trends are
   insignificant for west and central Mediterranean. Additionally, NAO
   index was found to be anticorrelated with the precipitation totals and
   the number of rain days mainly in Spain, southern France, Italy and
   Greece. These correlations are higher within the rain season
   (October-March) than the entire year. Based on the results of regional
   climate model RACMO2.1/KNMI, precipitation is very likely to decrease
   almost 20\% in the period 2071-2100 compared to 1961-1990, under SRES
   A1B.},

Abstract = {Long term trends in Japan's annual and monthly precipitation are
   investigated in this study. The statistical significance of a trend at a
   study site is assessed by the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, and field
   significance of trends in climatic Regions II, III, and IV is evaluated
   using the bootstrap test preserving cross correlation. The practical
   significance of a trend is judged by a percentage change of the sample
   mean over an observation period. The field significance assessment
   demonstrates that annual precipitation in Region II did not show any
   significant change, but regional precipitation shifts occurred in
   different months. Precipitation significantly increased by 12.2 percent
   in May, while it significantly decreased by 12.0, 10.5, 15.6, and 19.7
   percent, respectively, in April, September, October, and December. In
   Region III, annual precipitation declined by 11.8 percent, and monthly
   precipitation significantly decreased from September through January and
   in April, with the greatest decrease (38.2 percent) in December. In
   Region IV, significant reductions occurred in both annual precipitation
   (by 15.6 percent) and monthly precipitation from September through
   February and in June and July, with the worst reduction (44.7 percent)
   in December.},

Abstract = {The intensity distribution of daily precipitation amounts in the UK has
   changed over the period 1961-1995, becoming on average more intense in
   winter and less intense in summer. This result is based on an analysis
   of 110 UK station records. In winter, and in terms of their relative
   contributions to total winter precipitation, there has been a decline in
   light and medium events and an increase in the heaviest events. This
   change is fairly uniform across the whole country and is apparent even
   when longer records (with reduced spatial coverage/detail) are analysed
   back to 1931 or 1908. The reverse is found in summer: over 1961-1995
   there has been a decline in the proportion of the seasonal total being
   provided by the heaviest events. In the longer term context, however,
   the summer changes appear to be a return to earlier levels after a
   period in the 1960s when heavy summer rainfall made a greater than
   normal contribution. More complex changes have occurred in the intensity
   distribution of spring and autumn precipitation, with opposite changes
   in different regions of the UK. Copyright (VC) 2000 Royal Meteorological

Title = {Precipitation trend increases the contribution of dry reduced nitrogen
   deposition},
Journal = {NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},

Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Given the leveling off in oxidized nitrogen emissions around the world,
   the atmospheric deposition of reduced nitrogen (NHx = NH3 + NH4+) has
   become progressively critical, especially dry deposition, which presents
   great threats to plant growth. A combination of historical deposition
   data of measured wet NHx and modeled dry NHx in China suggests that dry
   NHx deposition has been increasing substantially (4.50\% yr(-1), p <
   0.05) since 1980. Here, chemical transport model (WRF-EMEP) results
   indicate that variation in NH3 emissions is not a dominant factor
   resulting in the continually increasing trends of dry NHx deposition,
   while climate change-induced trends in precipitation patterns with less
   frequent light rain and more frequent consecutive rain events (with >= 2
   consecutive rainy days) contribute to the increase in dry NHx
   deposition. This will continue to shift NHx deposition from wet to dry
   form at a rate of 0.12 and 0.23\% yr(-1) (p < 0.05) for the period of
   2030-2100 in China under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively.
   Further analysis for North America and Europe demonstrates results
   similar to China, with a consistent increase in the contribution of dry
   NHx deposition driven by changing precipitation patterns from similar to
   30\% to similar to 35\%. Our findings, therefore, uncover the change of
   precipitation patterns has an increasing influence on the shifting of
   NHx deposition from wet to dry form in the Northern Hemisphere and
   highlight the need to shift from total NHx deposition-based control
   strategies to more stringent NH3 emission controls targeting dry NHx
   deposition in order to mitigate the potential negative ecological
   impacts.},

Abstract = {Winter precipitation accounts for similar to 5\% of interannual spatial
   variability during the last five decades (1960-2015), with the largest
   variability in the western and central regions of Nepal. The temporal
   variability shows a relatively higher degree of variability after the
   1990s. In this study, the dominant modes of winter precipitation
   pattern, trend and their association with oceanic and atmospheric
   patterns were investigated over the southern slope of the central
   Himalaya, Nepal. The increasing trend (< 1 mm/year) of winter
   precipitation is found only over the highlands of the western and
   central regions, whereas decreasing trend or no trend in most of the
   areas over the country. Further, two dominant modes of winter
   precipitation were observed through Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF)
   analysis. The first leading mode (EOF1) shows a monopole pattern with
   42.9\% variability with strong loading over the western and central
   regions, whereas the second mode (EOF2) shows a heterogeneous pattern,
   accounting for 18.9\% of the total variance. Further, the EOF1 pattern
   is remotely influenced by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and
   locally through Indian Ocean Basin Mode (IOBM) patterns. It is also
   observed that the EOF2 mode has a close relationship with the North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), modulating the wave train and propagating
   eastward to the western Himalayas.},

Title = {Overlooked Trends in Observed Global Annual Precipitation Reveal
   Underestimated Risks},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Numerous human and environmental systems are sensitive to the spatial
   and temporal distribution of precipitation, including agriculture, water
   supply, and ecosystems. Trends in observed precipitation form an
   important line of evidence to understand how changes may increase system
   vulnerabilities. Linear trends reported in US and global climate
   assessments reflect changes in mean annual precipitation. Mean trends
   may not reflect changes across other quantiles in the precipitation
   probability distribution, including the tails (very high and low
   precipitation levels), leading to systematic mischaracterization of
   climate risk. Here we reanalyze global annual precipitation using
   quantile regression to reveal overlooked trends. We find trends in the
   tails inconsistent with the mean in 44.4\% of land area and 40.7\% of
   rainfed agricultural regions. Previously undetected trends offer a more
   accurate view of the changing climate. This work enables reappraisals of
   risk aggregated over thresholds in human and environmental systems,
   enabling revaluation of threats and identification of appropriate
   adaptation strategies.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {99},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Okinawa Island is located between mainland Japan to the northeast,
   Taiwan to the southwest and China to the west. In recent years,
   precipitation with relatively low pH has been observed in the island
   during winter seasons. This study was conducted to evaluate the
   potential sources and factors affecting distribution of trace metals in
   the atmosphere around the northern area of Okinawa Island. The results
   showed that the trace metal contamination was low comparable to rural
   areas of less industrialized countries. The annual average depositions
   were 6.0, 5.2, 4.4, 2.7 and 20.4 kg km(-2) y(-1) for Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, and
   Zn, respectively. The metals in the precipitation were mainly derived
   from the dissolution of wind-blown soil particles. The distribution of
   trace metals across the island showed the influence of road traffic as a
   source and cause of atmospheric pollution. Aluminium and Fe were found
   to be high closer to the main road and decreased further away from the
   road, while Zn and Cu were strongly correlated with average mean pH of
   precipitation. The variation of concentrations in the island was
   attributed to the distance from the main road, average rain pH at a
   particular sampling location and wind speed and direction. A strong
   correlation between lithological elements (Al and Fe) and anthropogenic
   elements (Zn and Cu) indicates that they were carried by the same
   particles and experienced similar scavenging mechanism during
   dissolution process. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recent modeling studies have predicted that while temperature is
   expected to increase over the next few decades in the Pacific Northwest
   (PNW), model predictions of winter season precipitat ion are highly
   variable. Implications of potential climate change were explored by
   regionalizing PNW climate. Using rotated Principal Components Analysis
   (PCA), sub-regions within the PNW were developed for winter season
   precipitation from 1895-2003. Analyses include synoptic discussions
   based on trends of the time series of the component scores as well as an
   examination of the sensitivity to the El Niho/Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) for each sub-region. Four
   sub-regions during the winter season were created, based on temporal
   variability of precipitation. While previous studies suggest that there
   is regional coherence in PNW precipitation, analysis of the time series
   of the component scores for each sub-region suggests otherwise. Several
   sub-regions show widely diverging trends in winter season precipitation
   over the past 30 yr, a period that also coincides with significant
   warming across the PNW. Differences in the sign and strength of
   correlations between ENSO and the PDO with winter season precipitation
   occur between the subregions, which further suggests a lack of coherence
   in the PNW.},

   of the monthly volume weighted mean concentrations of the analytes have

   half-lives on the order of 3 +/- 2 years. There was little, if any,
   spatial variability in the observed half-lives, suggesting similar loss
   processes for the various lakes and suggesting that the decrease in
   precipitation concentrations reflects a regional decrease in
   environmental levels. The first-order half-lives of organochlorine
   pesticide concentrations in Great Lakes precipitation were not
   significantly different than the corresponding atmospheric gasphase,
   lake water, and biota half-lives, suggesting that the entire system is

Abstract = {Rainwater harvesting (RWH) for domestic uses is widely regarded as an
   economic and ecological solution in water conservation and storm
   management programs. This paper aims at evaluating long-term trends in
   20-day cumulative rainfall periods per year in Poland, for assessing its
   impact on the design and operation conditions for RWH systems and
   resource availability. The time-series employed corresponds to a set of
   50-year long time-series of rainfall (from 1970 to 2019) recorded at 19
   synoptic meteorological stations scattered across Poland, one of the
   European countries with the lowest water availability index. The methods
   employed for assessing trends were the Mann-Kendall test (M-K) and the
   Sen's slope estimator. Most of the datasets exhibit stationary behaviour
   during the 50-year long period, however, statistically significant
   downward trends were detected for precipitations in Wroclaw and Opole.
   The findings of this study are valuable assets for integrated water
   management and sustainable planning in Poland.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the authors evaluate the significance of multidecadal
   trends in seasonal-mean summertime precipitation and precipitation
   characteristics over the southwestern United States using stochastic,
   chain-dependent daily rainfall models. Unlike annual-mean precipitation,
   trends during the summertime monsoon, covering the period 1931-2000,
   indicate an overall increase in seasonal precipitation, the number of
   rainfall events, and the coverage of rainfall events in peripheral
   regions north of the ``core{''} monsoon area of Arizona and western New
   Mexico. In addition, there is an increasing trend in intense storm
   activity and a decreasing trend in extreme dry-spell lengths. Over other
   regions of the domain, there are no discernible trends found in any of
   the observed characteristics. These trends arc robust to the choice of
   start dates and, in the case of seasonal-mean precipitation, appear to
   persist into the current century.},

Title = {Trend analysis of precipitation using innovative approaches in
   northwestern Turkey},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {131},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Precipitation is highly sensitive to climate change, and monitoring its
   trends over time is essential for under-standing the effects of global
   warming on the Earth's water cycle. This study investigates the effects
   of climate change on monthly precipitation in the Susurluk Basin located
   in northwestern Turkey, using innovative trend analysis methods.
   Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA) using star graphics and
   Improved Visualization for Innovative Trend Analysis (IV-ITA) techniques
   were used to analyze precipitation data from nine stations in the basin
   over 50 years (1970-2019), and the findings were compared to classical
   Mann-Kendall (MK) results. Ac-cording to the trend analysis results, the
   MK method detected significant trends in only two months in the
   decreasing direction. In these decreasing trends observed at Simav and
   Keles stations in November, z values were calculated as-2.38 and-2.05,
   respectively. IPTA method detected increasing trends in 54 months and
   decreasing trends in 40 months; this means there is a change of more
   than 5\% between two half series. The IV-ITA method indicated an
   increase of more than 40\% in the low values for January, March, August,
   and September. In addition, there was an increasing trend of more than
   40\% in the high values observed in September at all stations. It was
   observed that mean precipitation heights increased from September to
   December and then decreased throughout the basin. It is predicted that
   decreases in precipitation during dry seasons may put intense pressure
   on agricultural water use and affect water quality. In addition, the
   increase in precipitation in spring months may increase flood events. It
   was determined that graphical innovative trend analysis methods are more
   effective in trend identification than MK, and these methods' results
   have much higher visual inspection and linguistic interpretation
   possibilities. Innovative methods allow for more flexible and in-depth
   analysis using different statistical parameters.},

Title = {Precipitation trends (1958-2021) on Ammassalik island, south-east
   Greenland},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {Along with Arctic warming, climate models project a strong increase in
   Arctic precipitation in the 21st century as well as an increase in the
   ratio of liquid to total precipitation. In the precipitation-rich region
   of south-east Greenland, precipitation changes could locally have
   significant impacts on runoff. However, climate data are sparse in this
   remote region. This study focuses on improving our understanding of the
   past precipitation changes on Ammassalik island in south-east Greenland
   between 1958 and 2021. To assess past changes in air temperature at 2
   -meter and precipitation, output from a regional polar climate model
   (RACMO2.3p2) is evaluated with measurements from automatic weather
   stations in Tasiilaq and on Mittivakkat glacier. In addition, RACMO2.3p2
   is used to assess past seasonal changes in air temperature at 2-meter,
   precipitation amount, precipitation phase and the altitude of the
   rain/snow boundary. We find that the climate model accurately represents
   the monthly average observed air temperature at 2-meter. While total
   precipitation is overestimated, interannual variability of precipitation
   is properly captured. We report a significant increase of summer
   temperature at 2-meter of +0.3 degrees C/decade (p < 0.01) at
   Mittivakkat glacier and +0.2 degrees C/decade (p < 0.01) in Tasiilaq in
   1958-2021. For the subperiod 1990-2019, the trend in annual averages of
   temperature at 2-meter in Tasiilaq (+0.8 degrees C/decade, p=0.02)
   corresponds well to known temperature trends on the Greenland Ice Sheet
   within the same period. On Mittivakkat glacier a significant trend is
   not detected within this subperiod (+0.2 degrees C/ decade, p=0.25). The
   modelled liquid precipitation ratio on Ammassalik island increased in
   all summer months (1958-2015) by +2.0/+1.9/+1.8\%/decade in
   June/July/August respectively. In July and August, these trends were
   stronger at higher elevations. No statistical evidence is found for
   trends in other seasons. We also identify monthly increases in the
   altitude of the rain-to-snow boundary (+25/+23/ +20 m/decade in
   July/August/September respectively).},

Abstract = {We analyzed trends in precipitation characteristics at 12 weather
   stations in Bangladesh using data from 1950 to 2008 and a non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall's tau test. It was found that the annual precipitation
   amount and the number of wet days tended to increase at almost all the
   stations. The number of days with weak precipitation (< 3 mm) showed
   increasing tendency; the number of days with daily precipitation
   exceeding 10 mm increased at three stations; and the number of days with
   daily precipitation exceeding 20 mm increased at two stations. Heavy
   rainfall index showed no clear trend, and was dominated by inter-annual
   and/or decadal variations. During the pre-monsoon season, seasonal
   precipitation amount and the number of wet days increased, and the
   number of days with weak precipitation (< 3 mm) also increased. Changes
   in the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were insigniicant.},

Title = {Have aerosols affected trends in visibility and precipitation in Europe?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Here we investigate whether the large variations in anthropogenic
   aerosol concentrations over the last decades have had a notable effect
   on precipitation in Europe. Our main focus is on the heavily
   industrialized region formerly known as the Black Triangle (BT), where
   pollution levels increased until the late 1980s and then decreased
   substantially. Precipitation changes in this area are compared to
   changes in a clean coastal region in western Europe with minor pollution
   trends but with potentially higher aerosol-precipitation susceptibility.
   We find that pollution reductions caused a substantial increase in
   horizontal visibility of 15 km from 1983 to 2008 in the BT, contrasting
   a 2.5 km increase in the clean region. Over the same period total
   precipitation trends show no sign of aerosol influence, neither in years
   of emission increases nor emission reductions, and a circulation-based
   precipitation estimate indicates that the observed trends may be
   entirely explained by atmospheric circulation changes. The annual
   frequency of light precipitation events, however, increased
   significantly in the clean region, and in the BT we find significant
   changes in both total and light precipitation frequency for wind
   directions at which sulphate trends were largest. The trends were most
   pronounced in the summer season. Altogether, we find no verification
   that changes in pollution have caused measurable changes in total
   precipitation in Europe, but changes in light precipitation types bear a
   potential aerosol signal.},

Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},

Volume = {2010},
Abstract = {We use detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method to detect the
   long-range correlation and scaling properties of daily precipitation
   series of Beijing from 1973 to 2004 before and after adding diverse
   trends to the original series. The correlation and scaling properties of
   the original series are difficult to analyze due to existing crossovers.
   The effects of the coefficient and the power of the added trends on the
   scaling exponents and crossovers of the series are tested. A crossover
   is found to be independent of the added trends, which arises from the
   intrinsic periodic trend of the precipitation series. However, another
   crossover caused by the multifractal vanishes with the increasing power
   of added trends.},

Abstract = {The aim of the paper lies in the identification of possible significant
   linear trends at monthly, seasonal and annual timescales in the
   Mediterranean during the second half of the 20th century. Monthly and
   daily records of 63 stations have been used to elaborate several
   precipitation indices: sum of daily precipitation (SDP) for rainfall >
   0.1 mm, > 10 mm and > 9(th) percentile, of number of rainy days (RD) >
   0.1 mm and > 10 mm and of mean daily precipitation (MDP) > 0.1 mm and >
   10 mm. For each index the stations have been gathered together by
   Rotated Principal Component Analyses to determine 8 sub-areas which can
   be considered as identical for all the timescales at the spatial scale
   of the research. Trends have been estimated from the scores of each
   eigenvector retained in all RPCAs. They are mainly non existant or non
   significant decreasing, even if a few monthly trends appear to be
   significantly diminishing, primarily during winter months, March in the
   Atlantic region, October in the Mediterranean Spain, December in the
   Lions and Genoa Gulfs, January, winter and the year in Greece, winter
   and the year in Italy and winter in the Near East and increasing in
   April in the two gulfs. Correlation coefficients between SDP > 0.1 mm
   and other indices have been computed: the significant trends seem mainly
   related to RD > 10mm, which represents a high percentage of the total
   rainfall amount. Greece is remarkable: SDP > 0.1 mm and > 10 mm decrease
   significantly during January, winter, the rainy season and the entire
   year whereas SDP > 95(th) percentile increases significantly, in
   accordance with the climatic change scenarios for the end of this
   century as does the decreasing of the total monthly and seasonal
   rainfall.},

Title = {Precipitation trend-Elevation relationship in arid regions of the China},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Based on monthly precipitation data at 128 meteorological stations in
   the arid regions of the China (ARC), we investigated that the regional
   characteristics of precipitation trend and the precipitation
   trend-elevation relationship during the period of 1961-2012. There is
   growing evidence that the elevation-dependent wetting (EDWE), which is
   the precipitation wetting trend is amplified with elevation. The
   precipitation trend increases significantly with elevation except for
   the altitude from 500 to 1500 m, the highest correlation appears above
   1500 m, increases by 13 mm/decade with each 1000 m. With the elevation
   increasing every 1000 m, precipitation tendency rate increases by 7
   mm/decade from 1000 to 2000 m and increases by 10 mm/decade from 2000 to
   4000 m. EDWE has an impact on the change of the cryospheric systems,
   ecosystems and water resources, especially in arid regions of China. We
   discuss mechanisms that contribute towards EDWE: water vapor changes and
   warming-driven water circulation speeds up. We suggest future needs to
   increase evidence of understand the EDWE in other mountainous regions,
   and its controlling mechanisms through integrated the observational
   network of surface in-situ climate observations, satellite data and
   high-resolution climatic modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The North China Plain (NCP) is the most important food grain producing
   area in China and has suffered from serious water shortages. To capture
   variation water availability, it is necessary to have an analysis of
   changing trends in precipitation. This study, based on daily
   precipitation data from 47 representative stations in NCP records passed
   the homogeneity test, analyzed the trend and amplitude of variation in
   monthly, seasonal and annual precipitation, annual maximum continuous
   no-rain days, annual rain days, rainfall intensity, and rainfall
   extremes from 1960 to 2007, using the Mann-Kendall (M-K) test and Sen's
   slope estimator. It was found that monthly precipitation in winter had a
   significant increasing trend in most parts, while monthly precipitation
   in July to September showed a decreasing trend in some parts of NCP. No
   significant changing trend was found for the annual, dry and wet season
   precipitation and rainfall extremes in the majority of NCP.A significant
   decreasing trend was detected for the maximum no-rain duration and
   annual rain days in the major part of NCP. It was concluded that the
   changing trend of precipitation in NCP had an apparent seasonal and
   regional pattern, i.e., precipitation showed an obvious increasing trend
   in winter, but a decreasing trend in the rainy season (July to
   September), and the changing trend was more apparent in the northern
   part than in the southern and middle parts. This implies that with
   global warming, seasonal variation of precipitation in NCP tends to
   decline with an increasing of precipitation in winter season, and a
   decreasing in rainy season, particularly in the sub-humid northern part.},

Abstract = {Extreme weather exerts a huge impact on human beings and it is of vital
   importance to study the regular pattern of meteorological and
   hydrological factors. In this paper, a selection of seven extreme
   indices is used to analyze the trend of precipitation extremes of 18
   meteorological stations located in Zhejiang Province, east China using
   the Mann-Kendall test. Then the precipitation trends in the plum season
   (from May to July) and typhoon season (from August to October) are
   studied separately. The results show that the precipitation trend varies
   from east to west. There is a positive trend in the east and a negative
   one in the west. The largest part of Zhejiang Province shows a positive
   trend in heavy precipitation and the most significant upward trend is
   detected in Dinghai with 3.4 mm/year for precipitation on very wet days.
   Although the upward trend of extreme precipitation is not prevailing,
   the range of increase in specific areas is apparent, like Dinghai with
   1.3 mm/year. Precipitation intensity exhibits an upward trend in most
   areas and a typical upward trend can be found in Dachendao, Tianmushan,
   and Yuhuan with 0.04, 0.02, and 0.05 mm/year respectively. Precipitation
   intensity in both plum and typhoon seasons has increased too, especially
   for the coastal stations.},

Abstract = {The presence of a trend in hydrological parameters can result from the
   highly variable nature of hydrological processes or be related to
   climate variations. The purpose of this work is to contribute to a
   better understanding of the variability of precipitation by
   investigating recent trends in the temporal structure of this process in
   mainland Portugal. The study uses annual and monthly precipitation data
   from 107 locations scattered over the territory. The time span of the
   records is 60 years, from 1941 to 2000. The data are analysed using
   statistical methods (e.g. Mann-Kendall trend test). In order to take
   into account seasonality and serial correlation, the months of the year
   were analysed separately. The analyses of both annual and monthly data
   led to a characterization of changes in the distribution of
   precipitation over mainland Portugal and within the year.},

Title = {Extreme Precipitation Events in Alaska: Historical Trends and Projected
   Changes},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While recent increases in heavy precipitation events in some midlatitude
   regions are consistent with climate model simulations, evidence of such
   increases in high latitudes is more tenuous, partly because of data
   limitations. The present study evaluates historical and future changes
   in extreme precipitation events in Alaska. Using the ERA5 reanalysis,
   station data, and output from two downscaled global climate models, we
   examine precipitation-driven flood events at five diverse locations in
   Alaska where major historical floods provide benchmarks: Fairbanks
   (August 1967), Seward (October 1986), Allakaket/Bettles (August 1994),
   Kivalina (August 2012), and Haines (December 2020). We place these
   precipitation events into a framework of historical trends and
   end-of-century (2065-2100) model projections. In all but one of the
   flood events, the amount of rainfall was the highest on record for the
   event duration, and precipitation events of this magnitude are generally
   projected by the models to remain infrequent. All of the cases had
   subtropical or tropical moisture sources. None of the locations show
   statistically significant historical trends in the magnitude of extreme
   precipitation events. However, the frequencies of heavy precipitation
   events are projected to increase at most of the locations. The frequency
   of events with 2 year and 5 year historical return intervals is
   projected to become more frequent, especially in the Interior, and in
   some cases increase to several times per year. Decreases are projected
   only for Seward along Alaska's southern coast.},

Title = {Nonstationary frequency analysis of extreme precipitation: Embracing
   trends in observations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {637},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the recurrence intervals of precipitation extremes is vital
   for infrastructure design, risk assessment, and insurance planning.
   However, trends and shifts in rainfall patterns globally pose challenges
   to the application of extreme value analysis (EVA) which relies
   critically on the assumption of stationarity. In this paper, we explore:
   (1) the suitability of nonstationary (NS) models in the presence of
   statistically significant trends, and (2) their potential in modeling
   out-of-sample data to improve frequency analysis of extreme
   precipitation. We analyze the benefits of using a nonstationary
   Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model for annual extreme precipitation
   records from Southern Brazil. The location of the GEV distribution is
   allowed to change with time. The unknown GEV model parameters are
   estimated using Bayesian techniques coupled with Markov chain Monte
   Carlo simulation. Next, we use GAME sampling to compute the evidence
   (and their ratios, the so-called Bayes factors) for stationary and
   nonstationary models of annual maximum precipitation. Our results show
   that the presence of a statistically significant trend in annual maximum
   precipitation alone does not justify the use of a NS model. The location
   parameter of the GEV distribution must also be well defined, otherwise,
   stationary models of annual maximum precipitation receive more support
   by the data. These findings reiterate the importance of accounting for
   GEV model parameters and predictive uncertainty in frequency analysis
   and hypothesis testing of annual maximum precipitation data records.
   Furthermore, a meaningful EVA demands detailed knowledge about the
   origin and persistence of observed changes.},

Abstract = {This study presents an analysis of daily rainfall categories over a
   region of southern Italy using a set of daily homogenous precipitation
   series for the period 1916-2006. Six daily rainfall categories have been
   considered: Light, 0-4 mm/day; Light Moderate, 4-16 mm/day;
   Moderate-Heavy, 16-32 mm/day; Heavy, 32-64 mm/day; Heavy-Torrential,
   64-128 mm/day; Torrential, 128-up mm/day. Results showed that
   Light-Moderate, Moderate-Heavy and Heavy rainfall are the main
   contributors to the total annual rainfall. Moreover, a trend analysis
   through the Mann-Kendall test showed a decreasing trend of the higher
   categories and an increasing trend of the weaker categories. (C) 2016

Abstract = {In order to understand the rising number of flash floods and landslides
   in the densely populated region of southeastern Brazil, this study
   analyzes the spatial and temporal changes in precipitation from 1978 to
   2014. We focus on the sensitivity of mountainous regions, specifically
   the Rio de Janeiro (RJMR) and Santa Catarina (SCMR) regions. Daily
   rainfall observations are aggregated into annual and seasonal indexes,
   and RClimdex is used to evaluate a suite of precipitation and extreme
   event indexes. Results show positive annual and seasonal precipitation
   trends during all seasons except for the winter season in the RJMR.
   Diverse change points in their time series, spatial differences in the
   trends at individual stations, and trends associated with elevation
   suggest that despite the close proximity of these two regions, climate
   impacts are not uniform across all of southeastern Brazil. The majority
   of precipitation-related indexes present positive trends, especially in
   the extreme precipitation indexes (PRCPTOT, RX1day, Rx5day and R30 mm).
   Statistically significant positive correlations are discovered between
   landslides/flash floods events and annual maximum 1-day and 5-day
   consecutive precipitation, and these indexes may be useful indicators of
   natural hazard events for this region.},

Title = {Trends of the precipitation acidity over China during 1992-2006},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN},

Volume = {55},

Pages = {1800-1807},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The trends of the precipitation acidity from 1992 to 2006 were studied,
   based on the long-term acid rain observations at 74 sites in China. The
   results show that there was no remarkable change or extension of acid
   rain area (i.e., with annual mean of precipitation pH<5.6) during the 15
   years. The largest and continuous acid rain area exists in the south of
   the Yangtze River, while the acid rain areas north of the Yangtze River
   remain separate. The severe acid rain area (i.e., with annual mean of
   precipitation pH<4.5) exists mainly in the south of the Yangtze River.
   The overall precipitation acidity for the 74 stations showed different
   trends before 1999 and after 2000. In the period 1992-1999, the
   precipitation acidity at most of the sites remained steady or showed a
   decreasing trend. After 2000, however, an increasing trend of the
   precipitation acidity was observed at many sites in North China, Central
   China, East China, and South China. As a result, the pattern of acid
   rain area changed during 1992-2006. The precipitation over North China,
   Central China, and South China became more acidified in the 15 years,
   with more pronounced trends in North China and the north of Central
   China. A slight decrease in the precipitation acidity was found in
   Southwest China, an area characterized as severest acid rain area for
   about two decades after the early 1980s. Consequently, the center of
   severe acid rain area in the south of the Yangtze River moved eastwards.
   The non-hydrogen conductivity (NHC), which is defined as the difference
   between the measured precipitation conductivity and the H(+)
   conductivity calculated from measured pH, was estimated and treated as a
   proxy of soluble ions in precipitation. The result shows that the
   overall trend of the NHC before 1999 was pronounced and positive, while
   the trend after 2000 was inconspicuous or slightly negative. During
   2000-2006, the change rate of pH was positively correlated to that of
   the NHC at 21 sites, implying that the increasing acidities found at
   these sites may partly be attributed to the decrease in the

Abstract = {This research investigates the spatial and temporal trend analysis of
   precipitation time series. Precise predictions of precipitation trends
   can play an imperative role in economic growth of a country. This study
   examined precipitation inconsistency for 23 stations at Dongting Lake,
   China, over a 52-year study period (1961-2012). Statistical,
   nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's rho tests were applied to
   identify trends within monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation. The
   trend-free pre-whitening method was used to exclude sequential
   correlation in the precipitation time series. The performance of the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's rho tests was steady at the tested
   significance levels. The results showed a fusion of increasing and
   decreasing trends at different stations within monthly and seasonal time
   scales. The results obtained with the Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho
   tests showed agreement in their assessments of monthly, seasonal, and
   annual precipitation trends. The variability of negative and positive
   trends at various stations points to the need for more detailed studies
   on the climate change of this region. In the case of whole Dongting
   basin on the monthly time scale, a significant positive trend is found,
   while at Yuanjiang River and Xianjiag River both positive and negative
   significant trends are identified. Only Yuanjiang River has shown a
   significant trend on the seasonal time scale. No significant trends have
   been exhibited on the annual time scale in any case. In the case of
   monthly, Nanxian station exhibited the maximum positive increase in
   monthly precipitation during the months of July and September. In the
   case of seasonal, only Tongren station showed a positive trend on the
   monthly level, and no significant negative trends were detected in both
   spring and autumn seasons.},

Title = {Spatial Analysis of Monthly and Annual Precipitation Trends in Turkey},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Global climate change could have important effects on various
   environmental variables in many countries around the world. Changes in
   precipitation regime directly affect water resources management. So
   that, it is important to analyze the changes in the spatial and temporal
   rainfall pattern in order to improve water resources management
   policies. For this reason, non-parametric Mann-Kendall rank correlation
   test is used in order to examine the existence of trends in annual and
   monthly rainfall distribution. To understand the regional differences of
   precipitation in Turkey, the detected trends are spatially interpolated
   using geostatistical techniques in a GIS environment. The main objective
   of this paper is to evaluate three interpolation methods, concerning
   their suitability for spatial prediction of temporal trends of Turkey's
   monthly and annual rainfall data. The study used a dense and homogeneous
   monthly precipitation database comprising 120 rain-gauge stations over a
   32 years testing period of 1975-2009. The results conclusively show that
   significant positive trends are both infrequent and found only in
   outlying stations during March, April and October. In order to estimate
   and characterize the magnitude of observed changes at unmeasured
   locations, Ordinary Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighted and Completely
   Regularized Spline interpolation methods were employed and compared. A
   comparative analysis of interpolation techniques shows that Ordinary
   Kriging with having RMSE of 0.148 is the best choice. This is followed
   by Inverse Distance Weighted (RMSE 0.151), and Splines (RMSE 0.152).
   Cross validation of the results shows the largest over prediction at
   Kars rainfall station and largest under prediction at Burdur station.
   Upon for the examination of the cross-validation and spatial error
   clustering results, the Ordinary Kriging method was concluded to be the
   best algorithm in the interpolation process.},

   a dividing line) and decreasing by 34.9mm/10a in the western part; 2)
   precipitation in winter and summer (January, February, March, June and
   July) was increasing in almost whole province which usually with
   non-uniformity of precipitation distribution from the south to the

   November and December) was decreasing in most of the areas which usually
   with non-uniformity of precipitation distribution from the east to the
   west. March and December were transition periods between two spatial
   distribution patterns mentioned above; 3) the eastern part of Hubei has

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {34},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Land precipitation trend from 1951 to 2002 shows widespread drying
   between 10 degrees S to 20 degrees N but the trend from 1977 to 2002
   shows partial recovery. Based on general circulation model sensitivity
   studies, it is suggested that these features are driven largely by the
   meridional SST gradient trend in the tropics. Our idealized CCM3
   experiments substantiate that land precipitation is more sensitive to
   meridional SST gradient than to an overall tropical warming. Various
   simulations produced for the IPCC 4th assessment report demonstrate that
   increasing CO2 increases SST in the entire tropics non- uniformly and
   increases land precipitation only in certain latitude belts, again
   pointing to the importance of SST gradient change. Temporally varying
   aerosols in the IPCC simulations alter meridional SST gradient and land
   precipitation substantially. Anthropogenic aerosol direct solar forcing
   without its effects on SST is shown by the CCM3 to have weak but non-
   negligible influence on land precipitation.},

Abstract = {This study applied a number of statistical techniques aimed at
   quantifying the magnitude of projected mean rainfall and number of rainy
   days over Rwanda on monthly, seasonal, and annual timescales for the
   period 2015-2050. The datasets for this period were generated by BCM2.0
   for the SRES emission scenario SRB1, CO2 concentration for the baseline
   scenario (2011-2030) using the stochastic weather generator (LARS-WG).
   It was observed that on average, there will be a steady decline in mean
   rainfall. Save for the short rainy season, a positive trend in mean
   rainfall is expected over the south-west, the north-east region, and the
   northern highlands. The other regions (central, south-east, and western
   regions) are likely to experience a decline in mean rainfall. The number
   of rainy days is expected to decrease in the central plateau and the
   south-eastern lowlands, while the south-west, the north-west, and
   north-east regions are expected to have a pattern of increased number of
   rainy days. This decline in mean rainfall and rainy days over a large
   part of Rwanda is an indicator of just how much the country is bound to
   experience reduced water supply for various uses (e.g., agriculture,
   domestic activities, and industrial activities).},

Abstract = {Daily precipitation rates observed at 576 stations in China from 1961 to
   2000 were classified into six grades of intensity, including trace (no
   amount), slight (<= 1 mm d(-1)), small, large, heavy, and very heavy.
   The last four grades together constitute the so called effective
   precipitation (> 1 mm d(-)1). The spatial distribution and temporal
   trend of the graded precipitation days are examined. A decreasing trend
   in trace precipitation days is observed for the whole of China, except
   at several sites in the south of the middle section of the Yangtze
   River, while a decreasing trend in slight precipitation days only
   appears in eastern China. The decreasing trend and interannual
   variability of trace precipitation days is consistent with the warming
   trend and corresponding temperature variability in China for the same
   period, indicating a possible role played by increased surface air
   temperature in cloud formation processes. For the effective
   precipitation days, a decreasing trend is observed along the Yellow
   River valley and for the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and
   Southwest China, while an increasing trend is found for Xinjiang, the
   eastern Tibetan Plateau, Northeast China and Southeast China. The
   decreasing trend of effective precipitation days for the middle-lower
   Yellow River valley and the increasing trend for the lower Yangtze River
   valley are most likely linked to anomalous monsoon circulation in East
   China. The most important contributor to the trend in effective
   precipitation depends upon the region concerned.},

Abstract = {Precipitation trends in the Yangtze River catchment (PR China) have been
   analyzed for the past 50 years by applying the Mann-Kendall trend test
   and geospatial analyses. Monthly precipitation trends of 36 stations
   have been calculated. Significant positive trends at many stations can
   be observed for the summer months, which naturally show precipitation
   maxima. They were preceded and/or followed by negative trends. This
   observation points towards a concentration of summer precipitation
   within a shorter period of time. The analysis of a second data set on a
   gridded basis with 0.5 degrees resolution reveals trends with distinct
   spatial patterns. The combination of classic trend tests and spatially
   interpolated precipitation data sets allows the spatiotemporal
   visualization of detected trends. Months with positive trends emphasize
   the aggravation of severe situation in a region, which is particularly
   prone to flood disasters during summer. Reasons for the observed trends
   were found in variations in the meridional wind pattern at the 850 hPa
   level, which account for an increased transport of warm moist air to the
   Yangtze River catchment during the summer months.},

Abstract = {This study provides a long-term (1891-2014) global assessment of
   precipitation trends using data from two station-based gridded datasets
   and climate model outputs evolved through the fifth and sixth phases of
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6,
   respectively). Our analysis employs a variety of modeling groups that
   incorporate low- and high-top level members, with the aim of assessing
   the possible effects of including a well-resolved stratosphere on the
   model's ability to reproduce long-term observed annual precipitation
   trends. Results demonstrate that only a few regions show statistically
   significant differences in precipitation trends between observations and
   models. Nevertheless, this pattern is mostly caused by the strong
   interannual variability of precipitation in most of the world regions.
   Thus, statistically significant model-observation differences on trends
   (1891-2014) are found at the zonal mean scale. The different model
   groups clearly fail to reproduce the spatial patterns of annual
   precipitation trends and the regions where stronger increases or
   decreases are recorded. This study also stresses that there are no
   significant differences between low- and high-top models in capturing
   observed precipitation trends, indicating that having a well-resolved
   stratosphere has a low impact on the accuracy of precipitation
   projections.},

Abstract = {Daily precipitation data from the European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts (ERA-Interim) from 1979 to 2016 are analyzed to
   determine the trends in seasonal and extreme precipitation across the
   pan-Arctic and estimate the contributions to the trends from the dynamic
   (e.g., changes in circulation patterns) and thermodynamic processes
   (e.g., sea ice melt-water vapor feedback) and their interactions. The
   trends in the seasonal total precipitation are generally consistent with
   the trends in the occurrence of seasonal extreme precipitation. Although
   the trends vary considerably in direction and magnitude across the
   pan-Arctic and the seasons, more regions experience a statistically
   significant positive trend than negative trend, particularly in autumn
   and winter seasons and over areas of the Arctic Ocean and the northern
   North Atlantic. Statistically significant negative trends are mostly
   found in areas of northern Eurasian and North America. The thermodynamic
   processes account for more than 85\% of the total trends, with the rest
   of the trends explained by the dynamic processes (e.g., changes in
   circulation patterns) and the interaction between dynamic and
   thermodynamic processes.},

Number = {22},
Pages = {8487-8500},

Abstract = {An atmospheric classification for northwestern Australia is used to
   define periods of monsoon activity and investigate the interannual and
   intraseasonal variability of the Australian monsoon, as well as
   long-term precipitation trends at Darwin. The classification creates a
   time series of atmospheric states, which two correspond to the active
   monsoon and the monsoon break. Occurrence of these states is used to
   define onset, retreat, seasonal intensity, and individual active periods
   within seasons. The authors demonstrate the quality of their method by
   showing it consistently identifies extended periods of precipitation as
   part of the monsoon season and recreates well-known relationships
   between Australian monsoon onset, intensity, and ENSO. The authors also
   find that onset and seasonal intensity are significantly correlated with
   ENSO as early as July.Previous studies have investigated the role of the
   Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) during the monsoon by studying the
   frequency and duration of active periods, but these studies disagree on
   whether the MJO creates a characteristic period or duration. The authors
   use their metrics of monsoon activity and the Wheeler-Hendon MJO index
   to examine the timing of active periods relative to the phase of the
   MJO. It is shown that active periods preferentially begin during MJO
   phases 3 and 4, as the convective anomaly approaches Darwin, and end
   during phases 7 and 8, as the anomaly departs Darwin. Finally, the
   causes of the multidecadal positive precipitation trend at Darwin over
   the last few decades are investigated. It is found that an increase in
   the number of days classified as active, rather than changes in the
   daily rainfall rate during active monsoon periods, is responsible.},

Title = {Factors Contributing to Historical and Future Trends in Arctic
   Precipitation},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {The Arctic is notable as a region where the greatest rate of increase in
   precipitation associated with global warming is anticipated. The Arctic
   precipitation simulated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   Phase 6 models showed a strong increasing trend since the 1980s. We
   found that the forcing factor of the trend is a combination of the
   continued strengthening of greenhouse gas forcing and the leveling off
   of aerosol forcing dominated in earlier periods. From an energetic
   perspective, we found that the increased atmospheric radiative cooling
   and reduced sensible heat transport from lower latitudes contributed
   equally to the recent increase in Arctic precipitation. The combination
   of these two energetic factors suggests a doubling of the Arctic
   amplification factor for precipitation relative to that for temperature.
   Future Arctic precipitation will change in proportion to the temperature
   change, and the fractional contributions of the energetic factors will
   remain stable across various scenarios.
   The Arctic region is inherently a low-precipitation area. However,
   because of global warming, precipitation is expected to increase
   substantially in the Arctic region compared with the global average when
   viewed as a percentage change from the original precipitation. This
   severely affects climate change in the Arctic environment. The latest
   climate model simulations show that there has been a rapid increase in
   precipitation in the Arctic region in recent decades. The driving
   factors behind the rapid increase are the effects of the accelerating
   growth of greenhouse gas concentrations, which were previously
   suppressed by the increasing anthropogenic aerosol emissions before the
   1980s. Based on the heat budget of the atmosphere, we identified
   important factors contributing to these precipitation changes. These
   include enhanced radiative cooling (responding locally to increased air
   temperature) and reduced heat transport from lower latitudes due to
   greater temperature increases at higher latitudes. Future precipitation
   will change in proportion to the temperature change while maintaining
   consistent fractional contributions across different scenarios.
   Trends in Arctic precipitation in the recent and future decades are
   examined from multimodel simulations The recent rapid increase is driven
   by accelerating greenhouse gas concentrations and plateauing growth in
   anthropogenic aerosol emissions Increased radiative cooling and reduced
   poleward sensible heat transport equally contributed to the Arctic
   precipitation changes},

Abstract = {Research to detect changes in precipitation variables has become a topic
   of particular interest to understand modifications in water resources
   availability. The review is focused on the Italian territory, outlining
   the ``state of the art{''} of changes in precipitation regime through a
   review of 54 published studies on observed rainfall trend analyses, in
   the period 1999-2018. The aim is to combine a large body of knowledge in
   a single review and to explain the main patterns of rainfall changes
   occurred in Italy over the last decades. The analysis focused on the
   Total Precipitation (TP) and the number of Wet Days (WDs) indices at the
   annual and seasonal scale. A weight factor is introduced to take into
   account the differences among studies in geographical area, time series
   length, and number of stations. The review is accompanied by the
   discussion of other rainfall related variables, that is, precipitation
   intensity, extreme rainfall events and meteorological droughts, which
   are useful to provide a broader picture of rainfall changes. Overall,
   there is an agreement about the tendency of a decrease in wet days on
   the entire Italy, with limited discrepancies in the various regions. A
   decrease in wet days is accompanied by a negative trend (although less
   evident) in total precipitation, especially in winter. Nevertheless, a
   univocal direction of trends (or lack of thereof) in annual total
   precipitation and mostly hydrological extreme events is difficult to
   achieve.},

Abstract = {Since the early 2000s, the northeastern region of the United States
   (USNE) has received increased total annual precipitation along with more
   frequent extreme precipitation events. Although previous work has
   discussed the contribution to increased extreme precipitation from
   tropical cyclones, the large-scale driver(s) of summer precipitation
   increases in the extratropics has received little attention. Here, we
   show that the summer-season rainfall surpluses across the USNE are
   related to the increased frequency of atmospheric blocking over
   Greenland and the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The
   occurrence of these patterns in summer has been previously connected
   with southward shifted storm tracks and wet conditions across the
   eastern North Atlantic. Over the USNE, the circulation shifts are also
   related to enhanced rainfall due to southerly wind anomalies and
   increased moisture transport into and vertical motion over the region.
   It is important to note that the current generation of climate models
   used for future projections is unable to reproduce the observed tendency
   towards increased atmospheric blocking over Greenland. Thus, clarifying
   the association between Greenland blocking and recent precipitation
   changes across the USNE may help inform future climate projections of
   summer season rainfall for the region.},

Abstract = {Eastern Iberian Peninsula is characterized by the large occurrence of
   convective precipitation events, which entail important economic and
   social damage consequences. In order to prevent and minimize its
   effects, a good knowledge and understanding of the meteorological
   processes involved are necessary to be achieved. In this regard, an
   algorithm for classifying convective and stratiform precipitation
   components has been applied to a decadal precipitation record.
   Dataset were provided by National Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET)
   for the period 1998-2008. Hourly precipitation records have been
   analyzed. The goals of this study have been: a) to classify total
   precipitation into its stratiform and convective components in Levante
   region (located in the Eastern Spanish Coast) and b) to analyze annual
   and seasonal trends of such components.
   For determining both convective and stratiform precipitation components,
   a suitable exponential function has been used. After a computation
   process, critical precipitation intensity (so-called Re) is obtained for
   each year and season of the studied period. Every precipitation episode
   in Levante region is classified into prevailing convective or stratiform
   regime according to the threshold value defined by Rc.
   The results obtained have been compared to Tropical Ocean Global
   Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE) to
   verify the validity of the algorithm. First results show an annual and
   seasonal significant positive trend in total precipitation and
   stratiform component for 1998-2008 decade. Further analysis reveals that
   convective precipitation exhibits no significant trend. Preliminary
   conclusions state that the total precipitation amount in Levante Region
   strongly depends on the stratiform component evolution. (C) 2011

Abstract = {We analysed daily precipitation data at the rain gauge stations in North
   Korea over a period of 25 years from 1983 to 2007, and in South Korea
   over a period of 35 years from 1973 and 2007. We found a striking trend
   of decreasing summer precipitation across North Korea. By contrast, in
   South Korea, the trend is opposite: there is a major increase in summer
   precipitation. Also, the number of dry days in summer showed an
   increasing trend in North Korea and a decreasing trend in South Korea.
   For the number of days with heavy precipitation (i.e. days with above 50
   mm/day daily precipitation) during summer, a decreasing trend was
   detected in North Korea, but no trend in South Korea. However, in South
   Korea, there was a significant increase of days with heavy precipitation
   over the whole year. These opposite trends in summer precipitation
   between North and South Korea were further confirmed using four

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2009},

Abstract = {Late twentieth-century trends in New Zealand precipitation are examined
   using observations and reanalysis data for the period 1979-2006. One of
   the aims of this study is to investigate the link between these trends
   and recent changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the
   Southern Hemisphere. The contributions from changes in Southern
   Hemisphere climate modes, particularly the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) and the southern annular mode (SAM), are quantified for the
   austral summer season, December-February (DJF). Increasingly drier
   conditions over much of New Zealand can be partially explained by the
   SAM and ENSO. Especially over wide parts of the North Island and western
   regions of the South Island, the SAM potentially contributes up to 80\%
   and 20\%-50\% to the overall decline in DJF precipitation, respectively.
   Over the North Island, the contribution of the SAM and ENSO to
   precipitation trends is of the same sign. In contrast, over the
   southwest of the South Island the two climate modes act in the opposite
   sense, though the effect of the SAM seems to dominate there during
   austral summer. The leading modes of variability in summertime
   precipitation over New Zealand are linked to the large-scale atmospheric
   circulation. The two dominant modes, explaining 64\% and 9\% of the
   overall DJF precipitation variability respectively, can be understood as
   local manifestations of the large-scale climate variability associated
   with the SAM and ENSO.},

Volume = {12},

Pages = {350+},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Co-occurring hot and dry extremes are predicted to increase with global
   warming. Changes in precipitation will modulate the extent of these
   changes, highlighting the importance of understanding regional
   precipitation trends to prepare society and minimize impacts.
   Compound hot-dry events-co-occurring hot and dry extremes-frequently
   cause damages to human and natural systems, often exceeding separate
   impacts from heatwaves and droughts. Strong increases in the occurrence
   of these events are projected with warming, but associated uncertainties
   remain large and poorly understood. Here, using climate model large
   ensembles, we show that mean precipitation trends exclusively modulate
   the future occurrence of compound hot-dry events over land. This occurs
   because local warming will be large enough that future droughts will
   always coincide with at least moderately hot extremes, even in a 2
   degrees C warmer world. By contrast, precipitation trends are often weak
   and equivocal in sign, depending on the model, region and internal
   climate variability. Therefore, constraining regional precipitation
   trends will also constrain future compound hot-dry events. These results
   help to assess future frequencies of other compound extremes
   characterized by strongly different trends in the drivers.},

Journal = {GEOFIZIKA},

Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Pages = {127-150},
Abstract = {This paper analyses current precipitation rates (PRs) and trends over
   the Mediterranean Sea region and their response to global climate change
   scenarios. The analysis uses 0.25 degrees gridded PRs dataset over a
   13-year period (19982010) based on remote sensing data from the Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission. Future scenarios use the results of six
   global climate models (GCMs) under four representative concentration
   pathway scenarios (i.e., RCP26, RCP45, RCP60, and RCP85).
   Results indicate that the Mediterranean Sea region displays a seasonally
   significant (insignificant) wetter trend during cold (hot) seasons, and
   exhibits annual spatial variation ranging from under 15 to over 100 mm
   month(-1) over the period 1998-2010. Sea level pressure has two
   different effects on precipitation over the northern (inversely related
   to precipitation) versus southern (directly related to precipitation)
   Mediterranean Sea. However, sea surface temperature is anti-correlated
   with precipitation. The GCMs that describe the current Mediterranean Sea
   precipitation most realistically are GFDL-CM3-1, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and
   HadGEM2-AO, which are used to calculate the ensemble mean for each
   representative concentration pathway scenario. The ensemble means
   realizations indicate that the study area will experience substantial
   drought in the 21st century. Uncertainty in the projected precipitation
   over the Mediterranean Sea was partitioned into four sources, of which
   the used scenario dominates.},

Abstract = {One of the negative consequences of climate change is the also increase

   The effects of meteorological drought are often substantial, not only

   of this research was to determine the trends in the severity and
   occurrence of droughts in Europe during the period 1951-2015 using the
   standardized precipitation index and the standardized precipitation and
   evapotranspiration index (SPEI). For six European sites located in mid
   latitudes, the number of dry months was determined and the trend of
   their occurrence was examined. Moreover, for the summer months in which
   the indicators fell below 0, the trend related to the severity of the
   drought was determined for each site. Despite the absence of a
   statistically significant trend of an increase in the occurrence of dry
   months in general, an increase in the severity of droughts occurring in
   summer was observed for the SPEI over a 6-month scale for all the
   investigated stations. The highest number of dry months since the 1970s
   appeared during the last 5 years of analysis.},

Journal = {METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},

Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precipitation and its distribution greatly influence the evolution of
   ecosystems and the development of society. The objective was to analyse
   trends in extreme precipitation indices at 25 weather stations of
   Aguascalientes State. Eleven extreme precipitation indices were
   obtained. The time series of these indices were analysed with the
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. The number of days above 50 mm,
   consecutive wet days, and extremely wet days did not have significant
   trends at any of the weather stations. Each of the indices maximum 1 day
   precipitation amount, maximum 5 day precipitation amount and number of
   very heavy precipitation days showed a significant positive trend at
   12\% of the weather stations; both the number of heavy precipitation
   days and the number of very wet days had significant positive trends at
   8\% of the weather stations; the simple daily intensity index,
   consecutive dry days and annual total wet-day precipitation showed
   significant positive trends at 20\%, 36\% and 4\% of weather stations,
   respectively. The intensity index was the only one that showed a
   significant negative trend, which happened at 4\% of the weather
   stations. In a small part of Aguascalientes, the precipitation
   intensity, the number of rainy days and the accumulated total increased
   in short periods. Also, in a reduced region, daily precipitation
   intensity decreased; and in another very small area the number of dry
   days increased. For mitigating the effects of these phenomena, it is
   suggested that water be used more efficiently for sustained agricultural
   production systems and ecosystem management. The results of the present
   study will be of great importance in future economic planning in the

Title = {Trends and variability in extreme precipitation indices over Maghreb
   countries},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3235-3248},
Abstract = {Maghreb countries are highly vulnerable to extreme hydrological events,
   such as floods and droughts, driven by the strong variability of
   precipitation. While several studies have analyzed the presence of
   trends in precipitation records for the Euro-Mediterranean basin, this
   study provides a regional assessment of trends on its southernmost
   shores. A database of 22 stations located in Algeria, Morocco and
   Tunisia with between 33 and 59 yr of daily precipitation records is
   considered. The change points and trends are analyzed for eleven climate
   indices, describing several features of the precipitation regime. The
   issue of conducting multiple hypothesis tests is addressed through the
   implementation of a false discovery rate procedure. The spatial and
   interannual variability of the precipitation indices at the different
   stations are analyzed and compared with large-scale atmospheric
   circulation patterns, including the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),
   western Mediterranean Oscillation (WEMO), Mediterranean Oscillation (MO)
   and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results show a strong tendency
   towards a decrease of precipitation totals and wet days together with an
   increase in the duration of dry periods, mainly for Morocco and western
   Algeria. On the other hand, only a few significant trends are detected
   for heavy precipitation indices. The NAO and MO patterns are well
   correlated with precipitation indices describing precipitation amounts,
   the number of dry days and the length of wet and dry periods, whereas
   heavy precipitation indices exhibit a strong spatial variability and are
   only moderately correlated with large-scale atmospheric circulation
   patterns.},

Title = {Deviation between projected and observed precipitation trends greater
   with altitude},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {79},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-89},
Abstract = {Variation in the amount and intensity of precipitation is one of the
   most important factors determining how biological systems respond to
   anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, given the importance of climate
   projections for influencing (inter)national policy, there is a pressing
   need to contextualise contemporary projections with observed trends to
   better inform environmental strategy and planning. In this study, we
   examine trends from one of the longest paired time series of upland
   (>300 m a.s.l.) and lowland precipitation records (1879-2012), and
   shorter-term observations (1961-2015) from multiple upland locations in
   southwestern (SW) England (Dartmoor National Park). In the period
   1879-2012, total precipitation at the upland site increased by more than
   10\% for spring, autumn, winter and annually; at the lowland site, only
   spring experienced a significant increase (8\%) in precipitation.
   Increases in autumn, winter and annual precipitation were recorded at
   upland sites since the 1960s. We compare observed precipitation trends
   with the latest UK climate projections (UKCP18) for the region across 2
   timeframes (60 and 90 yr). Changes in the 30 yr average between
   reference (1981-2010) and observed and projected precipitation totals
   were compared and deviations calculated. Comparisons between model
   projections and observed trends show large deviations for spring, summer
   and autumn precipitation in the mid- to late 21st century, with the
   deviation greatest in upland localities. However, winter projections
   were broadly consistent with observed trends. Our results suggest that
   uncertainties in future precipitation change are greatest in the
   uplands, where the impacts on ecosystem services are the largest.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, the results of trend analysis applied to precipitation
   and temperature monthly data for the period from 1962 to 2014 is
   presented for the hydrological year (from November to October) in
   sixteen climatic stations in Eastern Slovakia. The topography of this
   part of the country is very diverse and it affects the climate. The
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test coupled with Sen's slope was applied to
   identify the significant long-term climatic trends, as well as the
   magnitude of those trends. According to the present study, all climatic
   stations in Eastern Slovakia show a positive trend in temperature during
   the year and almost all of them show a significant positive annual trend
   in temperature. Seasonal and monthly trend analyses produced the same
   results. Trends in temperature are always positive during winter and
   spring. Trends in precipitation are also mostly positive during winter
   and spring, although some negative trends were also found during these
   seasons. The spatial distribution of precipitation and temperature
   trends was modelled in ArcGIS using geostatistical analysis. Abrupt
   positive trend shifts in annual precipitation and temperature time
   series were also investigated. An abrupt shift in precipitation at the
   highest climatic station, Lomnicky peak, began around 1985 (+). Abrupt
   shifts in temperature began around 1970 (+) at the presented climatic
   stations. The extremity of the climate is confirmed by an analysis of
   the trends in wet and dry spells. Trends showed increasing tendencies in
   medium- and long-term wet spells.},

Abstract = {Based on observed daily precipitation data of 540 stations and 3,839
   gridded data from the high-resolution regional climate model
   COSMO-Climate Limited-area Modeling (CCLM) for 1961-2000, the simulation
   ability of CCLM on daily precipitation in China is examined, and the
   variation of daily precipitation distribution pattern is revealed. By
   applying the probability distribution and extreme value theory to the
   projected daily precipitation (2011-2050) under SRES A1B scenario with
   CCLM, trends of daily precipitation series and daily precipitation
   extremes are analyzed. Results show that except for the western
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and South China, distribution patterns of the
   kurtosis and skewness calculated from the simulated and observed series
   are consistent with each other; their spatial correlation coefficients
   are above 0.75. The CCLM can well capture the distribution
   characteristics of daily precipitation over China. It is projected that
   in some parts of the Jianghuai region, central-eastern Northeast China
   and Inner Mongolia, the kurtosis and skewness will increase
   significantly, and precipitation extremes will increase during
   2011-2050. The projected increase of maximum daily rainfall and longest
   non-precipitation period during flood season in the aforementioned
   regions, also show increasing trends of droughts and floods in the next
   40 years.},

Abstract = {With the current concern over climate change, descriptions of how
   rainfall patterns are changing over time can be useful. Observations of
   daily rainfall data over the last few decades provide information on
   these trends. Generalized linear models are typically used to model
   patterns in the occurrence and intensity of rainfall. These models
   describe rainfall patterns for an average year but are more limited when
   describing long-term trends, particularly when these are potentially
   non-linear. Generalized additive models (GAMS) provide a framework for
   modelling non-linear relationships by fitting smooth functions to the
   data. This paper describes how GAMS can extend the flexibility of models
   to describe seasonal patterns and long-term trends in the occurrence and
   intensity of daily rainfall using data from Mauritius from 1962 to 2001.
   Smoothed estimates from the models provide useful graphical descriptions
   of changing rainfall patterns over the last 40 years at this location.
   GAMS are particularly helpful when exploring non-linear relationships in
   the data. Care is needed to ensure the choice of smooth functions is
   appropriate for the data and modelling objectives. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {Heat waves are increasing in frequency, duration, and intensity and are
   strongly linked to anthropogenic climate change. However, few studies
   have examined heat waves in Florida, despite an older population and
   increasingly urbanized land areas that make it particularly susceptible
   to heat impacts. Heavy precipitation events are also becoming more
   frequent and intense; recent climate model simulations showed that heavy
   precipitation in the three days after a Florida heat wave follow these
   trends, yet the underlying dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms have not
   been investigated. In this study, a heat wave climatology and trend
   analysis are developed from 1950 to 2016 for seven major airports in
   Florida. Heat waves are defined based on the 95th percentile of daily
   maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures. Results show that heat waves
   exhibit statistically significant increases in frequency and duration at
   most stations, especially for mean and minimum temperature events.
   Frequency and duration increases are most prominent at Tallahassee,
   Tampa, Miami, and Key West. Heat waves in northern Florida are
   characterized by large-scale continental ridging, while heat waves in
   central and southern Florida are associated with a combination of a
   continental ridge and a westward extension of the Bermuda-Azores high.
   Heavy precipitation events that follow a heat wave are characterized by
   anomalously large ascent and moisture, as well as strong instability.
   Light precipitation events in northern Florida are characterized by
   advection of drier air from the continent, while over central and
   southern Florida, prolonged subsidence is the most important difference

Abstract = {This study emphasized the predication of future precipitation trend at
   Xin'anjiang-Fuchunjiangwatershed and its comparison with that of the
   base (past) years. Possible beginning of change in precipitation trend
   has also been studied in order to get an idea about future water
   resources. CMIP5 data has been downscaled to the observed metrological
   stations using change factor downscaling method according to local
   conditions of watershed. In order to remove the serial effect of data,
   non-parametric pre-whitening technique was used. Non-parametric Mann
   Kendall (MK), Spearman's rho (SP/SR), Theil Sen's (TSA) and Sequential
   Mann Kendall (SQMK) techniques were applied on two different base
   (1960-2010) and future (2011-2060) precipitation data series. Mann
   Kendall and Spearman's rho have been applied to detect any significant
   trend within a data series, whereas TSA have been used to get the
   magnitude of the trend. The SQMK non parametric technique has applied in
   order to get an idea about the beginning of a potential change in
   precipitation trend. Results revealed that there is no significant
   change in annual precipitation trend for either base or future data
   series, meanwhile, an increasing trend was evident during winter and
   autumn seasons while summer and spring seasons exhibited a decreasing
   one. Same changes in precipitation trend were observed in the study area
   during 2020-2030 decade.},

Title = {Trends in monthly precipitation over the northwest of Iran (NWI)},

Abstract = {Increasing global temperatures during the last century have had their
   own effects on other climatic conditions, particularly on precipitation
   characteristics. This study was meant to investigate the spatial and
   temporal monthly trends of precipitation using the least square error
   (LSE) approach for the northwest of Iran (NWI). To this end, a database
   was obtained from 250 measuring stations uniformly scattered all over
   NWI from 1961 to 2010. The spatial average of annual precipitation in
   NWI during the period of study was approximately 220.9-726.7 mm. The
   annual precipitation decreased from southwest to northeast, while the
   large amount of precipitation was concentrated in the south-west and in
   the mountainous areas. All over NWI, the maximum and minimum
   precipitation records occurred from March to May and July to September,
   respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV) is greater than 44 \% in
   all of NWI and may reach over 76 \% in many places. The greatest range
   of CV, for instance, occurred during July. The spatial variability of
   precipitation was consistent with a tempo-spatial pattern of
   precipitation trends. There was a considerable difference between the
   amounts of change during the months, and the negative trends were mainly
   attributed to areas concentrated in eastern and southern parts of NWI
   far from the western mountain ranges. Moreover, limited areas with
   positive precipitation trends can be found in very small and isolated
   regions. This is observable particularly in the eastern half of NWI,
   which is mostly located far from Westerlies. On the other hand, seasonal
   precipitation trends indicated a slight decrease during winter and
   spring and a slight increase during summer and autumn. Consequently,
   there were major changes in average precipitation that occurred
   negatively in the area under study during the observation period. This
   finding is in agreement with those findings by recent studies which
   revealed a decreasing trend of around 2 mm/year over NWI during
   1966-2005.},

   corresponds to the increase in high precipitation.},

Abstract = {Temporal trend of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was determined in
   precipitation and monthly depositional fluxes were calculated in Beijing
   for the first time from February 2009 to March 2011. Total PCBs
   concentrations ranged from 7.00 to 993 ng L-1 in dissolved phase and
   from 1.00 to 133 ng L-1 in particulate phase, with a two orders of
   magnitude variation. Concentrations of PCBs were dominated by dissolved
   phase, which accounted for 82.5\% of the total PCBs in precipitation,
   implying PCBs enrichment in rainwater due to efficient scavenging of
   highly contaminated gas phase and nonfilterable submicron particles
   which easily adsorbed organic contaminants in urban atmosphere. Highest
   concentrations of PCBs were measured in snow, which were about two times
   higher than those in rainwater, demonstrating more efficient scavenging
   of PCBs by snow. The sum of bi-, tri- and tetrachlorinated congeners
   accounted for 70.5\% of total PCBs in precipitation, suggesting that
   PCBs mainly come from the historical usage of domestic PCB product,
   e.g., trichlorobiphenyl. PCBs concentrations in both dissolved and
   particulate phases showed slow rate of decline, with a half-life of 16.9
   years in precipitation, suggesting that the atmospheric concentrations
   of PCBs were decreasing slowly in Beijing. The wet deposition flux of
   Sigma PCBs ranged from 0.240 to 6.55 mu g m(-2) month(-1) (mean: 1.41 mu
   g m(-2) month(-1)), indicating a relatively high level of PCBs
   contamination in Beijing atmosphere. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Number = {1},
Pages = {18-28},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The issue of water shortage and related eco-environmental degradation in
   North China is one of the major emerging problems in China.
   Precipitation is the most key factor for water resources. Based on the
   historical flood/dryness grade dataset during the period of 1470-2000
   obtained from 25 gauging stations in North China, the multi-scale
   variability and trends are analyzed by means of power spectral and
   continuous wavelet transform. It is found that the precipitation is
   characterized by obvious seasonal changes, quasi biennial oscillations,
   inter-annual 4-7 year component and inter-decadal 19-year periodicity.
   The MK test results showe that step changes occurred around 1914 and
   1964 in the annual precipitation. As for the historical flood/dryness
   grade time series, it is characterized by 4 similar to 5 year ENSO mode
   inter-annual oscillation, quasi-10 year inter-decadal variability,
   quasi-24 year component and 50-80 year centurial periodicity. However,
   the scales of these variations have decreased significantly since the
   1970s. The trend for precipitation change in North China has been
   negative for last 30 years. Further research shows that North China will
   continue to become dryer until 2015 and may change to a wetter regime
   after 2020. These findings should be helpful for future decision-making
   to ensure sustainable water resource management in North China.},

Abstract = {Autumn runoff events rivalling the size of the spring freshet peak as
   well as sustained winter streamflow have become more common in the
   northwestern Canadian Shield since the mid 1990s. Previous circumpolar
   and large regional-scale studies have implied these phenomena are due to
   increased water inputs from thawing permafrost. However, results from an
   investigation of the precipitation and temperature trends provide an
   alternate explanation for this region. A shift from a nival to a
   combined nival/pluvial streamflow regime, particularly in small
   watersheds, can be attributed to trends in the timing and state of
   autumn precipitation. Because these trends are subtle, careful
   consideration of hydrological processes, and the temporal and landscape
   context in which they operate, is important when attempting to explain
   the observed shifts in regional streamflow. It is important to correctly
   explain why streamflow regimes are changing because of close
   relationships with variations in ground thermal conditions and aquatic
   chemistry, which are of significance to society. These relationships are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The Little River is on the state of Tennessee's Year 2004 list of
   impaired waters, and has existing total maximum daily loads for sediment
   and E. coli bacteria. In this study, we investigate how precipitation,
   discharge, sediment, and pathogens are related in the Little River. Our
   goals are to: (1) determine the degree of correlation between
   precipitation, turbidity, stream discharge, and pathogen (total coliform
   and E. coli) concentrations; (2) identify and describe seasonal patterns
   that may exist for both pathogens and turbidity: and (3) develop a
   simple statistical model that predicts pathogen concentration from
   rainfall, stream discharge, and turbidity measurements. Spearman's
   correlation results show that discharge is most highly correlated to
   seven-day antecedent precipitation, and that turbidity and pathogen
   concentration are most highly correlated with the previous day's
   precipitation. In addition, total coliform concentrations are
   significantly (p = 0.01) higher in summer than in other seasons, but we
   were unable to show significant seasonal differences in E. coli
   concentrations. We propose a simple regression model (R-2 = 0.57) for E.
   coli using readily available and easily measurable parameters such as
   precipitation, discharge, and turbidity.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {How global precipitation might have changed on the
   interdecadal-to-multi-decadal time scales during the satellite
   (post-1979) era is examined by means of the satellite-based GPCP V2.3
   monthly precipitation analysis. Comparisons with the results from CMIP6
   and AMIP6 are further made in terms of global mean precipitation change
   and regional features of precipitation change, aiming to provide not
   only an improved understanding of the effects of major physical
   mechanisms on precipitation change, but also an assessment of the skills
   of current climate models and likely some clues for diagnosing possible
   limitations in observed precipitation. Long-term change/trend in global
   mean precipitation is generally weak in GPCP. Although the GPCP trend is
   statistically significant at the 90\% confidence level over global land
   + ocean during 1979-2020, it is not significant over either global land
   or ocean separately. For the shorter, overlap period with the CMIP6
   historical experiments (1979-2014), GPCP positive trends can't reach the
   90\% confidence level, while significant and more intense precipitation
   trends appear in CMIP6 ensemble-means. However, a roughly similar global
   sensitivity to surface temperature change can be derived in GPCP, CMIP6,
   and AMIP6, providing confidence in both observed and simulated global
   mean precipitation change. Large regional trends with positive and
   negative values can readily be seen across the world in GPCP. AMIP6 can
   generally reproduce these large-scale spatial features. Comparisons with
   CMIP6 confirm the combined effects from anthropogenic greenhouse-gases
   (GHG) forcing and internal modes of climate variability such as the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
   (AMO). Limiting the PDO/AMO effect makes the trend patterns in GPCP
   residuals more similar to those in CMIP6, implying that the GHG effect
   would become more readily detectable in observed precipitation in the
   near future with regards to both global mean and regional precipitation
   changes. Furthermore, similar changes in precipitation seasonal range,
   especially over global lands, occur in GPCP, CMIP6, and AMIP6,
   suggesting that the GHG effect might already be discernible in certain
   aspects of precipitation change.},

Title = {Means and Long-Term Trends of Global Coastal Zone Precipitation},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Precipitation in the coastal zone is important to the socio-economic and
   ecological well-being of the world. Meteorologically, precipitation is
   generated by unique mechanisms at the land-sea interface, which is why
   coastal zone precipitation is not well resolved by global climate
   models.Yet, to date, much more effort has been placed in analyzing
   global precipitation over the oceans and land. In this study, global
   coastal zone precipitation is quantified by selecting Global
   Precipitation Climatology Centre V2018 0.5 degrees grid cells in 50 km
   zones from the shoreline into the interior. The transition from maritime
   to continental precipitation regimes is revealed in the long-term
   (1931-2010) average, as there is a pronounced coast-to-interior decline
   in rainfall from approximately 911.5 mm yr(-1)within 50 km of the coast
   to 727.2 mm yr(-1)from 100 to 150 km away from the coast. Globally,
   coastal zone precipitation peaks in boreal summer, extending into fall
   for precipitation at the coastline. Dividing the long-term record into
   early and late 40-year periods reveals an increasing trend in
   precipitation in the coastal zone, with the interior increasing faster
   than at the coastline. Averaging over 30-year climate normals from
   1931-60 to 1981-2010 further confirms this result. A seasonal analysis
   reveals that the upward trends, and discrepancy between the coast and
   inland are maximized in the austral summer season. Interestingly, from
   May to September there is a declining trend in rainfall at the
   coastline, whereas the interior only shows minimal declines in August
   and September. Potential forcing mechanisms that could favor a wetter
   interior coastal zone include changes in the sea breeze circulation,
   urban heat island effect, or precipitation content associated with
   synoptic systems or monsoonal circulations.},

Abstract = {This study provides a better understanding of the relationships between
   the trends of mean and extreme precipitation in two observed
   precipitation data sets: the Climate Prediction Center Unified daily
   precipitation data set and the Global Precipitation Climatology Program
   (GPCP) pentad data set. The study employs three kinds of definitions of
   extreme precipitation: (1) percentile, (2) standard deviation and (3)
   generalize extreme value (GEV) distribution analysis for extreme events
   based on local statistics. Relationship between trends in the mean and
   extreme precipitation is identified with a novel metric, i.e. area
   aggregated matching ratio (AAMR) computed on regional and global scales.
   Generally, more (less) extreme events are likely to occur in regions
   with a positive (negative) mean trend. The match between the mean and
   extreme trends deteriorates for increasingly heavy precipitation events.
   The AAMR is higher in regions with negative mean trends than in regions
   with positive mean trends, suggesting a higher likelihood of severe dry
   events, compared with heavy rain events in a warming climate. AAMR is
   found to be higher in tropics and oceans than in the extratropics and
   land regions, reflecting a higher degree of randomness and more
   important dynamical rather than thermodynamical contributions of extreme
   events in the latter regions.},

Abstract = {The Canary Islands are characterized by their low availability of water
   resources and different studies have suggested a decrease of
   precipitation in the second half of the 20th century. Here, we have used
   the most complete precipitation data set available in the islands to
   create a dense high quality and homogeneous database, which was used to
   determine the spatio-temporal precipitation patterns in the archipelago
   and the influence of oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections. We have
   produced a robust regionalization of the Canary Islands precipitation,
   with three patterns that characterizing the south of the most montainous
   islands and El Hierro and La Gomera, the north of the most montainous
   islands and the easternmost arid islands (Lanzarote and Fuerteventura),
   respectively. All of them show high interannual variability, with no
   significant trends, except in a few cases. We highlight the strong
   influence of weather types and teleconections, modulated by the
   orography, with the highest influence recorded in the first pattern. It
   must be stressed that the oceanic teleconnections (in special with the
   tropical North Atlantic surface temperature) are more important than the
   North Atlantic Oscillation to explain interannual variability of
   precipitation.},

Volume = {45},
Number = {32},
Pages = {5822-5827},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Analysis of trends in climatological isentropes provides a means of
   evaluating seasonal precipitation trends. Past research has indicated
   that isentropic patterns are linked to moisture influx and adiabatic
   uplift. We calculate trends across the summer 315 K isentropic surface
   for the conterminous United States over the last fifty years. We
   identify positive correlations between time and the pressure levels of
   the 315 K isentropic surface in the southern Plains states and the New
   England area. Such correlations suggest long-term rising of pressures
   (lowering heights) for the isentropic surface (and therefore enhanced
   moisture inflow) into those regions. Weaker correlations with time and
   the isentropic surface are found in the Southwest and in the Northwest.
   Using two well-accepted precipitation databases, we compare the map
   pattern correlations between the trends in isentropic surfaces and the
   trends in both precipitation daily totals and in hourly durations. A
   strong correlation (+0.67) exists between the trends in the isentropic
   surface and the daily precipitation and indicates that the precipitation
   increases are likely influenced by a stronger moisture influx. A weaker
   positive correlation (+0.44) is evident between the trends in daily
   precipitation intensity and the trends in the 315 K isentropic surface.
   However, the spatial relationship between the trends in the isentropic
   surface and the trends in the hourly precipitation duration is only
   -0.07 indicating no significant accounting of trends in duration by
   corresponding isentrope surface trends. Continued study of the
   relatively neglected analysis of climatological isentropes will add to
   our understanding of the physical changes in precipitation patterns
   across the United States. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {USING NONSTATIONARY DEPTH-FREQUENCY CURVES TO CHARACTERIZE LOCAL
   PRECIPITATION TRENDS},
Journal = {APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-31},
Abstract = {. As climate change advances, the stationarity assumption that governs
   traditional precipitation analysis is becoming untenable. Studies that
   incorporate nonstationarity typically use global circulation model (GCM)
   projections to determine the magnitude and direction of expected
   precipitation changes. However, the high computational costs and the
   coarse spatial resolution of GCMs make this method unsuitable for local
   precipitation analysis. In this study, nonstationarity is represented by
   a precipitation probability distribution with time-varying parameters.
   Three generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions are fitted: (1) the
   shift model, where the GEV location parameter varies linearly with time,
   (2) the stretch model, where the GEV location and scale parameters both
   vary linearly with time, and (3) the stationary model, a time-invariant
   distribution provided for the purpose of comparison. This procedure is
   applied to 24-h annual maximum precipitation records for ninety years
   (1900-1989) at five long-term measuring sites in Pennsylvania. Results
   varied among the five sites, suggesting that localized climate effects
   can cause precipitation differences at a small spatial scale. No
   significant nonstationarity was detected in two of the five locations.
   In three locations, however, increases in GEV location and scale
   combined to create a substantial, though not always significant, rise in
   the frequency of extreme precipitation. These trends were extrapolated
   forward over 30 years (1990-2019) and compared with an observed
   distribution for that year. The nonstationary models appeared to perform
   better at sites with stronger precipitation trends, which suggests a
   simple procedure for selecting sites where nonstationary analysis is
   most needed.},

Abstract = {One of the consequences of the ongoing climate change is the increasing
   likelihood of extreme precipitation frequency in the future, which
   causes the declining trend of total precipitation that affects water
   debits in the watersheds and brings difficulties to a city like Padang
   that is situated near the watersheds. In order to elaborate on this, a
   number of extreme precipitation indices recommended by ETCCDMI was
   utilized to assess the extreme precipitation condition for the period
   1975-2013. These indices were calculated based on the rain-gauge
   stations along the watersheds in and around Padang. Before processing
   the data, a series of homogeneity test were undertaken to make sure the
   data were comparable. The results showed that there was a significant
   declining trend on the total annual precipitation (PRCPTOT), an
   increasing trend of the number of days without rain (R0) and a
   decreasing frequency of the number of days with precipitation of more
   than 50 mm in the Batang Kuranji Watershed. The results suggested that
   atmospheric circulations, such as El Nino and positive Dipole Mode, have
   played their role on the trend as a result of their intensified
   frequency due to global warming.},

Abstract = {Spatiotemporal trend of precipitation potentially influences vegetation
   restoration and soil erosion on the Loess Plateau. Daily data at 100
   meteorological stations in and around the area from 1957 to 2009 were
   used to analyze the spatiotemporal trends of precipitation and the
   return periods of the different types of precipitation classified in the
   study. Nonparametric methods (Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimation)
   were employed for temporal analysis and Kriging interpolation method,
   for spatial analysis.
   The annual precipitation was detected to have a slight decreasing trend
   at 0.1 significance level on the Loess Plateau and no change point
   existed. The decreasing rate changed from a negative value up to -3
   similar to-7 mma(-1) in southeast to a positive value up to 1 similar to
   2 mma(-1)in northwest. The average annual decreasing rate was found to
   be -1.15 mm a(-1) accounting for 0.26\% of the average annual
   precipitation. The area with decreasing trend accounted to 86\% of the
   total area of the Loess Plateau.
   Only except for the winter, the regional precipitation in other seven
   time series, i.e., spring, summer, autumn, wet season, dry season, EFP
   (early flood period), and LFP (late flood period), presented
   insignificantly decreasing trends. The areas for the seven time series
   were up to 70\%, 72\%, 83\%, 84\%, 90\%, 56\% and 89\% of the total
   area, respectively.
   The shifts of the 150, 250, and 350 mm isohyets were not evident between
   the decades. The weighted average centers of the 450 and 550 mm isohyets
   moved 134 km eastwards and 213 km westwards from 1960s to 1990s.
   However, the two centers retreated 12.1 km westwards and 54.8 km
   northwards from 1990s to 2000s.
   The frequencies of the precipitation types defined with Moderate, Heavy,
   Rainstorm, and Heavy Rainstorm were detected to have decreasing trends
   from 1960s-2000s, based on the decadal analysis. The return periods of
   the four types of precipitation changed from 0.13, 0.39, 1.82, 19.80 a
   in 1960s to 0.15, 0.39, 2.34, and 26.88 a in 2000s.
   Results indicates a small drier precipitation change of no significance
   given by Mann-Kendall test, the shifted southward precipitation
   isohyets, a slightly delayed rainy season, and the prolonged return
   period especially in rainstorm and heavy rainstorm types in the last 53
   years. Global climate change seemly did not influence the Loess Plateau
   of China greatly, but the variations of precipitation apparently took
   place both in spatial and temporal dimensions on the Loess Plateau from
   1960s to 2000s.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyse observed changes in characteristics of

   consistency with the daily control records, and unreliable data were
   removed from the data set. Subsequently, four statistical tests were
   applied to assess the homogeneity of the data set. The trend magnitude
   was estimated using the Theil-Sen slope estimator, and two tests were
   applied to evaluate its significance. For most of the indices, the tests
   did not indicate inhomogeneity, with the exception of characteristics
   related to rainfall intensity. The trends are positive for most of the
   stations and most precipitation characteristics, and significant
   positive trends are much more frequent than negative trends. The
   analysis revealed a significant increase in the contribution of heavy
   precipitation to the precipitation total in half of the stations at
   short aggregation levels.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper was to analyze the annual rainfall
   variability and to identify the standard-years of the Middle Solimoes -
   AM region. For this, were collected rainfall data from the National
   Institute of Meteorology (INMET) and the National Water Agency (ANA) in
   the period 1992-2012 and applied statistical techniques such as the
   mean, coefficient of variation, percentile for year- standard, and
   non-parametric statistical tests such as Mann-Kendall and Petitt, with
   the aim of studying the trend, variability and rupture of the rainfall
   of the historical series. It was observed that the Northwest portion had
   the highest coefficients of variation, the dry and dry years in more
   than half of the meteorological stations were 2004/2005 and 2010/2011.
   The year 2012 was considered rainy in 50\% of the seasons. The
   predominant frequency of the dry and dryseason standard years is related
   to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena and the temperature
   of the North Atlantic and the ENSO cold phase in the predominantly rainy
   years. Significant positive and negative trends were 18.8\%. The spatial
   extent of the tendency to increase precipitation occurred in stations
   close to the portions of the municipality of Tefe, Carauari and Fonte
   Boa and the negative ones in the municipality of Coari. It is concluded
   that the rainfall trend in the Middle Solimores did not demonstrate a
   predominant spatial pattern in the period analyzed except in a few
   individual seasons, but it demonstrated the greater presence in the last
   decade of standard dry and dry years},

Abstract = {This paper employed the Sen's innovative trend analysis (ITA) method to
   identify overall and partial trends in annual rainfall records over the
   Central Highlands of Vietnam. Additionally, the lowest values of
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for 3 and 12 months were
   subjected to the analysis to reveal potential changes in the greatest
   intensity of meteorological drought. The outcomes from a preliminary
   assessment by applying the normal (Gaussian) probability distribution
   functions (PDFs) indicate significant increases in standard deviation
   values of the second half subseries (current climate), thereby implying
   greater level of rainfall variability. The results from temporal trend
   analysis show that there is high domination of neutral and decreasing
   trends in annual rainfall records, with the estimated ITA slopes varying
   mainly from - 10 to - 14 mm/year. Furthermore, the low value sub-groups
   are mainly characterized by significant decreasing trends, which is an
   evident indication of possible increases in drought intensity. These
   results were further demonstrated by evaluating the ITA plots for the
   lowest values of SPI in both 3-month and 12-month timescales. The lowest
   values of SPI are mainly lower than - 1.5 and - 2.0 corresponding to
   severe and extreme drought categories, and most of the scatter points in
   low SPI cluster are accumulated in the lower triangular area of 1:1
   line. Generally, it is expected that these findings will contribute
   various well-founded foundations to manage water-use activities and
   natural hazards associated with rainfall shortages.},

Abstract = {This research introduces a climatology of hourly precipitation
   characteristics, investigates trends in precipitation hours (PH) and
   hourly accumulation, and uses four different time series to determine if
   precipitation intensity is changing across the southeastern United
   States from 1960 to 2017. Results indicate hourly intensity
   significantly increased at 44\% (22/50) of the stations, accompanied by
   an increase in average hourly accumulation at 40\% of the sites analyzed
   (20/50). The average duration of precipitation events decreased at 82\%
   (41/50) of the stations. However, the frequency of 90th percentile
   hourly events and events above station-specific average hourly totals
   did not show a broad increase similar to hourly intensity. It seems
   hourly events are becoming heavier on average, while the duration of the
   average precipitation event is decreasing. Geographically, heavy hourly
   events are more frequent along the Gulf Coast and decrease inland. PH
   significantly decreased across South Carolina, Georgia, and northern
   Florida, mainly due to significant decreases in winter (DJF) and spring
   (MAM). Decreases in PH during spring were contained to Georgia and South
   Carolina and were accompanied by a decrease in accumulation. Decreases
   in PH during winter were more widespread and did not exhibit a broad
   decrease in accumulation, suggesting winter precipitation across that
   portion of the region is becoming more intense.},

Abstract = {Using the daily precipitation data of 740 stations in China from 1960 to
   2000, the analysis on the variations and distributions of the frequency
   and the percentage of extreme precipitation to the annual rainfall have
   been performed in this paper. Results indicate that the percentage of
   heavy rains (above 25mm/day) in the annual rainfall has increased, while
   on average the day number of heavy rains has slightly reduced during the
   past 40 years. In the end of 1970s and the beginning of 1980s, both the
   number of days with extreme precipitation and the percentage of extreme
   precipitation abruptly changed over China, especially in the northern
   China. By moving t test, the abrupt change year of extreme precipitation
   for each station and its spatial distribution over the whole country are
   also obtained. The abrupt change years concentrated in 1978-1982 for
   most regions of northern China while occurred at various stations in
   southern China in greatly different/diverse years. Besides the abrupt
   change years of extreme precipitation at part stations of Northwest
   China happened about 5 years later in comparison with that of the

Title = {Climatological trends of mean and extreme daily precipitation in Arizona
   (USA)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {219},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Precipitation in Arizona, USA, represents a fundamental resource for the
   needs of agriculture, people, and the environment. However, due to the
   risk associated with flash flooding, extreme precipitation also
   constitutes a natural hazard. Available research on precipitation in
   Arizona has been limited in scope and focus and there currently exists
   no comprehensive assessment of statewide, historical, mean, and extreme
   precipitation. We use daily precipitation records from 43 Global
   Historical Climate Network daily (GHCNd) weather stations to examine
   trends in mean and extreme precipitation across Arizona from 1950 to
   2020. We use a suite of standardized precipitation indices and explore
   the statistical significance of historical changes at the annual,
   monthly, and seasonal scales. Our analysis returns a motley collection
   of results displaying a great degree of spatial variability and
   sensitivity to the temporal scale of analysis. Mean total precipitation
   at the statewide scale underwent a small decreasing trend of 0.15 mm
   year  1, with considerable interannual variability being a dominant
   feature. The majority of stations experienced no statistically
   significant change in extreme precipitation at the annual scale. Monsoon
   season mean precipitation followed a similar pattern to annual means,
   with an overall reduction of 0.14 mm year  1 across the state. One
   fourth of stations, all located at elevations lower than 650 m, recorded
   decreases in monsoon precipitation intensity. Winter season analysis
   presents a different picture, displaying a positive statewide trend of
   0.11 mm year  1 in mean precipitation. One tenth of stations recorded
   increases in extreme precipitation intensity and decreases in the number
   of consecutive dry days. Results of our observational analysis indicate
   a lack of a clear consensus on the climatological trends of mean/
   extreme precipitation in Arizona during the study period. Our findings
   are in contrast to those from other similarly arid areas across the
   world and highlight the role of regional differences in modulating the
   potential hydrometeorological impacts associated with climate change.
   However, while we do not find widespread, significant, modification in
   the spectrum of precipitation changes examined, the hydrologic system of
   the state has been - and will continue to be - impacted by the ongoing
   temperature increase associated with the buildup of greenhouse gases and
   continued population growth.},

Abstract = {River basins are important territorial units for geographical analysis,
   and are crucial for environmental planning, especially in metropolitan
   settings. The aim of this article was to evaluate rainfall trends and
   variability in the Guapimirim-Macacu basin, located in an urban
   development area in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region. Annual,
   monthly and daily records were collected from twenty rain gauge
   stations, for the period of 1967 to 2015. Analyses conducted using the
   RClimDex software revealed an increase in rainfall volume and number of
   wet days. The remaining indicators and patterns observed across stations
   also suggested that changes in precipitation trends occurred mostly on
   the day scale, and were likely attributable to global climate change.
   After controlling for seasonality and normalizing the series, a linear
   tendency between the mean monthly precipitation in the Guapimirim-Macau
   basin and sea surface temperature (SST), obtained from the National
   Centers for Environmental Prediction, revealed that rainfall in the
   region is strongly correlated with Pacific and Atlantic SST, revealing
   the importance of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone for rainfall
   variability in the area of study, especially in summer. These data are
   important for development planning and the management of water resources
   and supply in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region.},

Abstract = {Precipitation in Xinjiang, China, was modelled with covariates, such as
   time and climate indices, using quantile regressions. Compared to a
   frequentist quantile regression, a Bayesian quantile regression tended
   to generate smoother and narrower band confidence intervals of quantile
   regression coefficients, especially at extremely high and low quantile
   levels. A full picture of temporal trends at quantile levels from 0.01
   to 0.99 indicates that the wet season (May to August) precipitation in
   Northern Xinjiang and the western regions of Southern Xinjiang showed
   statistically significant increases with different magnitudes over all
   quantile levels. However, the wet season precipitation in South-eastern
   Xinjiang decreased at some quantile levels. The Eastern Atlantic/Western
   Russia (EAWR) pattern was the most significant large-scale climate
   pattern that influenced wet season precipitation when compared to other
   studied patterns, i.e. the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the
   Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
   (PDO), the Northern Oscillation (NO), the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and
   the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The quantile regression
   coefficients associated with the EAWR index positively increased from
   low to high quantile levels. The ENSO significantly affected the
   extremely high wet season precipitation in Xinjiang. El Nino increased
   and La Nina decreased wet season precipitation in Northern Xinjiang,
   with different magnitudes at different quantile levels. Other climate
   patterns, i.e. the AMO, PDO, NO, NAO and AO, did not evidently affect
   the wet season precipitation conditional on the ENSO and EAWR. These
   findings suggest that the predictability of seasonal precipitation over
   Xinjiang can be improved by incorporating indices associated with the
   ENSO and EAWR as model predictors.},

Abstract = {The role of the two main European low-frequency oscillations - the East
   Atlantic/West Russian (EA/WR) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO),
   in controlling the precipitation in the Eastern Mediterranean region is
   investigated based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and the Israeli
   precipitation data for 1958-1998. The data on the EA/WR and NAO indices,
   received from the NCEP Climate Prediction Center, are also adapted.
   Composite mean sea level and precipitation anomaly patterns are
   constructed and analyzed. In addition to the widely investigated
   positive NAO trend, another, also positive EA/WR trend characterized
   atmospheric developments during the period. During NAO positive months,
   the EA/WR-associated positive SLP anomaly areas were shifted from the
   east Atlantic to southwest Europe. The areas were shifted to the north
   during the NAO-negative months and were located over central and
   northern Europe. This demonstrates that the use of fixed pressure NAO
   patterns may be not the optimum way to understand climate variability.
   Analysis of the NAO, EA/WR patterns, as well as that of their decadal
   trends, demonstrated a relationship between the main European
   oscillations and the EM precipitation. The results allow explanation of
   the observed reduction of the north Israeli precipitation by the EA/WR
   positive trend during the period.},

Title = {Fortnightly Standardized Precipitation Index trend analysis for drought
   characterization in India},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 14},
Abstract = {Climate change is a major concern, as it profoundly affects many facets
   of our lives. It has brought about several issues, including declining
   water supply, reduced agricultural yields, increased drought
   occurrences, and increased heat waves. Amidst these challenges, the
   influence of short-term drought events on plant growth and irrigation
   schedule emerges as a critical concern. However, despite these evident
   consequences, a nuanced understanding of the intricate relationship
   between the severity and duration of short-period drought/deficit events
   still needs to be explored. This paper analyses fortnightly water
   deficit periods over different regions of India, which would be more
   relevant to re-scheduling the irrigation events than monthly or longer
   duration in preventing crops from reaching the permanent wilting point.
   Hence, this work considers analyzing 15-day Standardized Precipitation
   Index (SPI) trends and drought characteristics using conventional
   methods and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) techniques. The analysis
   uses gridded rainfall data from the India Meteorological Department
   (IMD), which has a spatial resolution of 0.250-E and 0.250-N. The data
   spans the period from 1970 to 2021. The ITA and Mann Kendall (MK)
   displayed nearly identical areas of increasing and decreasing trends,
   but ITA effectively identified significant trends. While MK and Modified
   Mann Kendall (MMK) could only indicate significant trends for 12.94\%,
   9.57\%, and 9.9\% of grid points for SPI, drought severity, and
   duration, respectively, ITA was able to identify significant trends at
   44.31\%, 10.9\%, and 10.1\% on an annual scale. The ITA method
   effectively identified the significant trends and magnitudes of
   fortnightly SPI and drought characteristics. The Tropical monsoon (Am),
   Tropical savannah (Aw), Arid desert hot (BWh), Arid steppe hot (BSh),
   and Temperate dry winter warm summer (Cwb) climatic zones have shown a
   significant increase in annual drought severity. Similarly, a
   significant increase in monsoon drought severity is observed across
   several states, including Gujarat and Mizoram, impacting diverse
   geographic extents. The present study can help policymakers and water

Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticide concentrations in precipitation samples
   collected from 1997 to 2003 at seven Integrated Atmospheric Deposition
   Network sites around the Great Lakes are reported. The 28-day volume
   weighted mean concentrations of several pesticides, including
   gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), endosulfan, hexachlorobenzene,
   chlordane, and DOE, showed significant seasonal trends. For current-use
   pesticides (enclosulfan and gamma-HCH), their concentrations peaked in
   late spring to summer just after their agricultural application. For the
   banned pesticides, higher concentrations were observed in the winter due
   to their enhanced partitioning to particles and scavenging by snow.
   Long-term decreasing trends were observed for several pesticides such as
   gamma-HCH and DOE. On the other hand, beta-HCH showed significant
   increasing concentrations as a function of time at Brule River, Eagle
   Harbor, and Sleeping Bear Dunes. Generally, Chicago had the highest
   concentration of chlordanes, dieldrin, and DDT, indicating that urban
   areas could be a source for these compounds to precipitation. For
   gamma-HCH and endosulfans, Point Petre had the highest concentrations
   due to the application of these pesticides in the surrounding areas.},

Title = {Historical Trends and Characteristics of Meteorological Drought Based on
   Standardized Precipitation Index and Standardized Precipitation
   Evapotranspiration Index over the Past 70 Years in China (1951-2020)},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Against the backdrop of global climate change, the frequency of drought
   events is increasing, leading to significant impacts on human society
   and development. Therefore, it is crucial to study the propagation
   patterns and trends of drought characteristics over a long timescale.
   The main objective of this study is to delineate the dynamics of drought
   characteristics by examining their propagation patterns in China from
   1951 to 2020. In this study, precipitation data from meteorological
   stations across mainland China were used. A comprehensive dataset
   consisting of 700 stations over the past 70 years was collected and
   analyzed. To ensure data accuracy, the GPCC (the Global Precipitation
   Climatology Center) database was employed for data correction and
   gap-filling. Long-term drought evolution was assessed using both the
   SPI-12 (standardized precipitation index) and SPEI-12 (standardized
   precipitation evapotranspiration index) to detect drought
   characteristics. Two Moran indices were applied to identify propagation
   patterns, and the MK (the Mann-Kendall) analysis method, along with the
   Theil-Sen slope estimator, was utilized to track historical trends of
   these indices. The findings of this study reveal the following key
   results: (i) Based on the SPI-12, the main areas of China that are prone
   to drought are mostly concentrated around the Hu Huanyong Line,
   indicating a tendency towards drying based on the decadal change
   analysis. (ii) The distribution of drought-prone areas in China, as
   indicated by the SPEI-12, is extensive and widely distributed, with a
   correlation to urbanization and population density. These drought-prone
   areas are gradually expanding. (iii) Between 2010 and 2011, China
   experienced the most severe drought event in nearly 70 years, affecting
   nearly 50\% of the country's area with a high degree of severity. This
   event may be attributed to atmospheric circulation variability,
   exacerbated by the impact of urbanization on precipitation and drought.
   (iv) The frequency of drought occurrence in China gradually decreases
   from south to north, with the northeast and northern regions being less
   affected. However, areas with less frequent droughts experience longer
   and more severe drought durations. In conclusion, this study provides
   valuable insights into the characteristics and propagation patterns of
   drought in China, offering essential information for the development of
   effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of drought events.},

   Midsummer Drought},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that the timing and intensity of the Central
   American Midsummer Drought (MSD) may be changing, while observations
   from limited meteorological station data and paleoclimate
   reconstructions show neither significant nor consistent trends in
   seasonal rainfall. Climate model simulations project robust future
   drying across the region, but internal variability is expected to
   dominate until the end of the century. Here we use a high-resolution
   gridded precipitation dataset to investigate these apparent
   discrepancies and to quantify the spatiotemporal complexities of the
   MSD. We detect spatially variable trends in MSD timing, the amount of
   rainy season precipitation, the number of consecutive and total dry
   days, and extreme wet events at the local scale. At the regional scale,
   we find a positive trend in the duration, but not the magnitude of the
   MSD, which is dominated by spatially heterogeneous trends and
   interannual variability linked to large-scale modes of ocean-atmosphere
   circulation. Although the current climate still reflects predominantly
   internal variability, some Central American communities are already
   experiencing significant changes in local characteristics of the MSD. A
   detailed spatiotemporal understanding of MSD trends and variability can
   contribute to evidence-based adaptation planning and help reduce the
   vulnerability of Central American communities to both natural rainfall
   variability and anthropogenic change.},

Abstract = {We have investigated the spatial patterns of trends in summer
   precipitation amount, intensity, and heavy precipitation for South Korea

   northern and central western part of South Korea. There is a significant
   increase in August precipitation for stations in the southeastern part
   of South Korea. Only a few stations exhibited significant upward trends
   in September precipitation. There is a weak to moderate spatial
   autocorrelation with the highest Moran's I value in June precipitation
   amount and August precipitation intensity. The number of days with daily
   precipitation exceeding 50 and 30 mm during the summer has increased at
   all stations. Observed trends are likely to be associated with changes
   in large-scale atmospheric circulation, sea surface temperature
   anomalies, and orography, but detailed causes of these trends need

Abstract = {The pace and direction of electrostatic precipitator (ESP) technology
   evolution in the United States will be governed by two key forces.  The
   first is new clean air legislation passed by the U.S. Congress and
   signed by President Bush on November 15, 1990.  This law requires
   electric utilities to further reduce SO2 and NO(x) emissions, which may
   impact particulate controls.  In addition, very fine (< 10 micron)
   particulates and potentially toxic trace emissions from utility power
   plants may be regulated.  The second major factor is the expected
   upsurge in new plant construction beginning in the late 1990s. 
   Together, these forces should define the performance requirements and
   market for new ESPs.
   This paper identifies and briefly describes technologies that the
   Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is developing to help U.S.
   utilities meet these challenges cost-effectively.  Among the
   technologies addressed are:  advanced digital voltage controls, flue gas
   conditioning, intermittent energization, temperature-controlled
   precharging (i.e., two-stage ESP), wide plate spacing, positive

Abstract = {This work studies long-term rainfall variations in Taiwan and provides
   local climate change analyses to global climate change. Around a century
   of rainfall data from 33 rain-gauges populate the database used herein.
   Statistical tests, such as cumulative deviations, Mann-Whitney-Pettitt
   statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis test, were first employed to determine
   whether annual rainfall series exhibit any regular trend. Analytical
   results indicate that the annual rainfall has increased in northern
   Taiwan, declined in central and southern Taiwan, and exhibited no clear
   tendency in Eastern Taiwan. Almost all of these rainfall series changed
   significantly around 1960, which date divides historical rainfall series
   into two sample groups. This change in the seasonal rainfall was further
   investigated.},

Title = {Precipitation and damaging floods: Trends in the United States, 1932-97},

Abstract = {The poor relationship between what climatologists, hydrologists, and
   other physical scientists call hoods, and those floods that actually
   cause damage to life or property, has limited what can be reliably said
   about the causes of observed trends in damaging floods. It further
   limits what can be said about future impacts of floods on society based
   on predicted changes in the global hydrological cycle. This paper
   presents a conceptual framework for the systematic assessment of the
   factors that condition observed trends in flood damage. Using the
   framework, it assesses the role that variability in precipitation has in
   damaging flooding in the United States at national and regional levels.
   Three different measures of flood damage-absolute, per capita, and per
   unit wealth-each lead to different conclusions about the nature of the
   flood problem. At a national level, of the 10 precipitation measures
   examined in this study, the ones most closely related to hood damage are
   the number of 2-day heavy rainfall events and the number of wet days.
   Heavy rainfall events are defined relative to a measure of average
   rainfall in each area, not as absolute thresholds. The study indicates
   that the growth in recent decades in total damage is related to both
   climate factors and societal factors: increased damage is associated
   with increased precipitation and with increasing population and wealth.
   At the regional level, this study reports a stronger relationship
   between precipitation measures and hood damage, and indicates that
   different measures of precipitation are most closely related to damage
   in different regions. This study suggests that climate plays an
   important, but by no means determining, role in the growth in damaging
   floods in the United States in recent decades.},

Abstract = {The recent study ``Trends of Extreme Precipitation in Eastern China and
   Their Possible Causes{''} attributed the observed decrease/increase of
   light/heavy precipitation in eastern China to global warming rather than
   the regional aerosol effects. However, there exist compelling evidence
   from previous long-term observations and numerical modeling studies,
   suggesting that anthropogenic pollution is closely linked to the recent
   changes in precipitation intensity because of considerably modulated
   cloud physical properties by aerosols in eastern China. Clearly, a
   quantitative assessment of the aerosol and greenhouse effects on the
   regional scale is required to identify the primary cause for the extreme
   precipitation changes.},

Abstract = {This work presents an analysis of the observed trends in extreme
   precipitation events in the Parana River basin (PRB) from 1977 to 2016
   (40 yr) based on daily records from 853 stations. The Mann-Kendall test
   and inverse-distance-weighted interpolation were applied to annual and
   seasonal precipitation and also for four extreme precipitation indices.
   The results show that the negative trends (significance at 95\%
   confidence level) in annual and seasonal series are mainly located in
   the northern and northeastern parts of the basin. In contrast, except in
   the autumn season, positive trends were concentrated in the southern and
   southeastern regions of the basin, most notably for annual and summer
   precipitation. The spatial distributions of the indices of annual
   maximum 5-day precipitation and number of rainstorms indicate that
   significant positive trends are mostly located in the south-southeast
   part of the basin and that significant negative trends are mostly
   located in the north-northeast part. The index of the annual number of
   dry days shows that 88\% of significant trends are positive and that
   most of these are located in the northern region of the PRB, which is a
   region with a high number of consecutive dry days (>90). The simple
   daily intensity index showed the highest number of stations (263) with
   mostly positive significant trends.},

Abstract = {Trends in precipitation are critical to water resources. Considerable
   uncertainty remains concerning the trends of regional precipitation in
   response to global warming and their controlling mechanisms. Here, we
   use an interannual difference method to derive trends of regional
   precipitation from GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project) data
   and MERRA (Modern- Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and
   Applications) reanalysis in the near-global domain of 60A degrees S-60A
   degrees N during a major global warming period of 1979-2013. We find
   that trends of regional annual precipitation are primarily driven by
   changes in the top 30\% heavy precipitation events, which in turn are
   controlled by changes in precipitable water in response to global
   warming, i.e., by thermodynamic processes. Significant drying trends are
   found in most parts of the U.S. and eastern Canada, the Middle East, and
   eastern South America, while significant increases in precipitation
   occur in northern Australia, southern Africa, western India and western
   China. In addition, as the climate warms there are extensive
   enhancements and expansions of the three major tropical precipitation
   centers-the Maritime Continent, Central America, and tropical
   Africa-leading to the observed widening of Hadley cells and a
   significant strengthening of the global hydrological cycle.},

Abstract = {Using 92-year precipitation data from 400 rain gauge stations located in
   48 states throughout the continental United States, the change in
   precipitation in space and time was investigated. The variability in
   precipitation was investigated using an entropy-based approach. The
   Mann-Kendall, Spearman's rho, and Sen slope tests were applied to assess
   the existence of a trend in precipitation. Analysis showed that annual
   precipitation exhibited lower temporal variability than did its
   constituent seasonal series. The fall precipitation had the highest
   variability, and the spring precipitation the lowest. Not many stations
   exhibited trends, and they are concentrated in limited areas of the
   United States. The greatest part of those exhibiting statistically
   significant trends showed increasing trends both in precipitation and
   rainy days. Only in a few cases negative trends were found. Finally,
   analysis showed that no relationship can be established between trend
   and variability in precipitation. DOI:

Title = {Spatio-Temporal Trends of Monthly and Annual Precipitation in
   Aguascalientes, Mexico},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to analyze the temporal patterns of
   monthly and annual precipitation at 36 weather stations of
   Aguascalientes, Mexico. The precipitation trend was determined by the
   Mann-Kendall method and the rate of change with the Theil-Sen estimator.
   In total, 468 time series were analyzed, 432 out of them were monthly,
   and 36 were annual. Out of the total monthly precipitation time series,
   42 series showed a statistically significant trend (p <= 0.05), from
   which 8/34 showed a statistically significant negative/positive trend.
   The statistically significant negative trends of monthly precipitation
   occurred in January, April, October, and December. These trends denoted
   more significant irrigation water use, higher water extractions from the
   aquifers in autumn-winter, more significant drought occurrence, low
   forest productivity, higher wildfire risk, and greater frost risk. The
   statistically significant positive trends occurred in May, June, July,
   August, and September; to a certain extent, these would contribute to
   the hydrology, agriculture, and ecosystem but also could provoke
   problems due to water excess. In some months, the annual precipitation
   variability and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were statistically
   correlated, so it could be established that in Aguascalientes, this
   phenomenon is one of the causes of the yearly precipitation variation.
   Out of the total annual precipitation time series, only nine series were
   statistically significant positive; eight out of them originated by the
   augments of monthly precipitation. Thirteen weather stations showed
   statistically significant trends in the total precipitation of the
   growing season (May, June, July, August, and September); these stations
   are located in regions of irrigated agriculture. The precipitation
   decrease in dry months can be mitigated using shorter cycle varieties
   with lower water consumption, irrigation methods with high efficiency,
   and repairing irrigation infrastructure. The precipitation increase in
   humid months can be used to store water and use it during the dry
   season, and its adverse effects can be palliated with the use of
   varieties resistant to root diseases and lodging. The results of this
   work will be beneficial in the management of agriculture, hydrology, and
   water resources of Aguascalientes and in neighboring arid regions
   affected by climate change.},

Title = {Monthly Precipitation over Northern Middle Atlas, Eastern Morocco:
   Homogenization and Trends},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The lack of a complete and reliable data series often represents the
   main difficulty in carrying out climate studies. Diverse causes, such as
   human and instrumental errors, false and incomplete records, and the use
   of obsolete equipment in some meteorological stations, give rise to
   inhomogeneities that do not represent climatic reality. This work in the
   northern part of the Moroccan Middle Atlas used 22 meteorological
   stations with sometimes-incomplete monthly precipitation data from 1970
   to 2019. The homogenization and estimation of the missing data were
   carried out with the R software package Climatol version 3.1.1. The
   trends in the series were quantified by the Mann-Kendall nonparametric
   test. The results obtained show a low root mean square error (RMSE),
   between the original and homogenized data, of between 0.5 and 38.7 mm
   per month, with an average of 8.5 mm. Rainfall trends for the months of
   December through June are generally downward. These negative trends are
   significantly stronger in the southern and eastern parts of the study
   area, especially during the month of April (the wettest month). On the
   other hand, July shows positive trends, with 71\% of stations having an
   increasing precipitation tendency, although only five (or 1/3) of these
   are statistically significant. From August to November, generally
   positive trends were also observed. For these months, the percentage of
   series with a positive and significant trend varied between 55 and 77\%.},

Abstract = {Extreme precipitation events have attracted a great deal of attention
   among the scientific community because of their devastating consequences
   on human livelihood and socio-economic development. To assess changes in
   precipitation extremes in a given region, it is essential to analyze
   decadal oscillations in precipitation extremes. This study examines
   temporal oscillations in precipitation data in several sub-regions of
   Iran using a novel quantile perturbation method during 1980-2010.
   Precipitation data from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for
   Research and Applications-Land (MERRA-Land) are used in this study. The
   results indicate significant anomalies in precipitation extremes in the
   northwest and southeast regions of Iran. Analysis of extreme
   precipitation perturbations reveals that perturbations for the monthly
   aggregation level are generally lower than the annual perturbations.
   Furthermore, high-oscillation and low-oscillation periods are found in
   extreme precipitation quantiles across different seasons. In all
   selected regions, a significant anomaly (i.e., extreme wet/dry
   conditions) in precipitation extremes is observed during spring. (C)

Abstract = {Global warming alters the hydrological cycle since a rise in temperature
   leads to an increase in the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere
   at a rate of about 7 \%/A degrees C. This fact can influence the global,
   but also local characteristics of precipitation, such as total amount
   and intensity. Therefore, it is important to study changes in rainfall
   regime in regions with complex orography, like Tuscany, where there are
   strong spatial gradients in precipitation amounts. The aim of this study
   is to look for temporal change in precipitation from 1955 to 2007
   searching for spatial differences. Daily data of 21 meteorological
   stations were analyzed to identify trends in seasonal and annual
   precipitation indices. Cluster analysis applied to principal components
   was applied to identify homogeneous groups of stations. A decrease in
   precipitation was observed at annual time scale, during winter and
   spring, especially in northwestern areas. Wet days highlighted a
   decrease in all of Tuscany, due to the same seasons. In northern
   Tuscany, the decrease in rainfall amount was mainly determined by a
   lower frequency of rainy events which in turn caused a decrease in the
   occurrence of extreme daily precipitation events (75th, 90th, and 95th
   percentile). In central-southern Tuscany, no significant changes were
   observed except for an increase in precipitation fraction, due to
   extreme events and in mean daily total amount for wet days. These
   results are consistent with recent findings for the Mediterranean area
   and confirm the usefulness of cluster analysis for the analysis of the
   spatial distribution of precipitation.},

Abstract = {The availability of highly accessible and reliable monthly gridded data
   sets of global land-surface precipitation is a need that was already
   identified in the mid-1980s when there was a complete lack of globally
   homogeneous gauge-based precipitation analyses. Since 1989, the Global
   Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) has built up its unique capacity
   to assemble, quality assure, and analyse rain gauge data gathered from
   all over the world. The resulting database has exceeded 200 yr in
   temporal coverage and has acquired data from more than 85 000 stations
   worldwide. Based on this database, this paper provides the reference
   publication for the four globally gridded monthly precipitation products
   of the GPCC, covering a 111-yr analysis period from 1901-present. As
   required for a reference publication, the content of the product
   portfolio, as well as the underlying methodologies to process and
   interpolate are detailed. Moreover, we provide information on the
   systematic and statistical errors associated with the data products.
   Finally, sample applications provide potential users of GPCC data
   products with suitable advice on capabilities and constraints of the
   gridded data sets. In doing so, the capabilities to access El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
   sensitive precipitation regions and to perform trend analyses across the
   past 110 yr are demonstrated. The four gridded products, i.e. the
   Climatology (CLIM) V2011, the Full Data Reanalysis (FD) V6, the
   Monitoring Product (MP) V4, and the First Guess Product (FG), are
   publicly available on easily accessible latitude/longitude grids encoded
   in zipped clear text ASCII files for subsequent visualization and
   download through the GPCC download gate hosted on
   ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/downloadgate.html by the Deutscher
   Wetterdienst (DWD), Offenbach, Germany. Depending on the product, four
   (0.25 degrees, 0.5 degrees, 1.0 degrees, 2.5 degrees for CLIM), three
   (0.5 degrees, 1.0 degrees, 2.5 degrees, for FD), two (1.0 degrees, 2.5
   degrees for MP) or one (1.0 degrees for FG) resolution is provided, and
   for each product a DOI reference is provided allowing for public user
   access to the products. A preliminary description of the scope of a
   fifth product - the Homogenized Precipitation Analysis (HOMPRA) - is
   also provided. Its comprehensive description will be submitted later in
   an extra paper upon completion of this data product. DOIs of the gridded
   data sets examined are as follows: doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/CLIM\_M

   physiology. A non-parametric Mann-Kendall's test and regression analysis
   are used to detect trends in annual, seasonal, and monthly precipitation
   and runoff, while Moran's I is adapted to determine the degree of
   spatial dependence in runoff trend among the basins. The results
   indicated that the long-term trends in annual precipitation and runoff
   were increased in northern regions and decreased in south-western
   regions of the study area during the study period. The non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test showed that spring streamflow was decreasing, while
   summer streamflow was increasing. April precipitation decreased between
   15\% and 74\% for basins located in south-western part of the Korean
   peninsula. June precipitation increased between 18\% and 180\% for the
   majority of the basins. Trends in seasonal and monthly streamflow show
   similar patterns compared to trends in precipitation. Decreases in
   spring runoff are associated with decreases in spring precipitation
   which, accompanied by rising temperatures, are responsible for reducing
   soil moisture. The regional patterns of precipitation and runoff changes
   show a strong to moderate positive spatial autocorrelation, suggesting
   that there is a high potential for severe spring drought and summer
   flooding in some parts of Korea if these trends continue in the future.

Title = {Mediterranean precipitation climatology, seasonal cycle, and trend as
   simulated by CMIP5},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Winter and summer Mediterranean precipitation climatology and trends
   since 1950 as simulated by the newest generation of global climate
   models, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), are
   evaluated with respect to observations and the previous generation of
   models (CMIP3) used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   Fourth Assessment Report. Observed precipitation in the Mediterranean
   region is defined by wet winters and drier summers, and is characterized
   by substantial spatial and temporal variability. The observed drying
   trend since 1950 was predominantly due to winter drying, with very
   little contribution from the summer. However, in the CMIP5 multimodel
   mean, the precipitation trend since 1950 is evenly divided throughout
   the seasonal cycle. This may indicate that in observation, multidecadal
   internal variability, particularly that associated with the North
   Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), dominates the wintertime trend. An estimate
   of the observed externally forced trend shows that winter drying
   dominates in observations but the spatial patterns are grossly similar
   to the multimodel mean trend. The similarity is particularly robust in
   the eastern Mediterranean region, indicating a radiatively forced
   component being stronger there. Results of this study also reveal modest
   improvement for the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble in representation of the
   observed six month winter and summer climatology. The results of this
   study are important for assessment of model predictions of hydroclimate
   change in the Mediterranean region, often referred to as a ``hotspot{''}
   of future subtropical drying. Citation: Kelley, C., M. Ting, R. Seager,

Abstract = {The Langat River Basin provides fresh water for about 1.2 million people
   in the Langat and Klang valleys. Any change in the pattern of rainfall
   could affect the quantity of water in the basin. Studying the pattern of
   change in rainfall is crucial for managing the available water resources
   in the basin. Thus, in this study, for the first time, both parametric
   and non-parametric methods were employed to detect rainfall trend in the
   basin for the period 1982-2011. The trends were determined at 30
   rainfall stations using the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, the Sen's slope
   estimator and the linear regression analysis. Lag-1 approach was
   utilized to test the serial correlation of the series. On the annual
   scale, it was found that most of the stations in the basin were
   characterized with insignificant trends. The significant trends were
   found only at the four stations, namely 44301, 44305, 44320 and 2719001.
   The results of the seasonal trend analysis showed that most of the
   stations during the northeast monsoon (NEM) and the inter monsoon 1
   (INT1) seasons and half of the stations during the southwest monsoon
   (SWM) season experienced insignificant positive trends. To the contrary,
   for the inter monsoon 2 (INT2) season, majority of the stations showed
   negative trends. It was found that during the NEM season the station
   44301, for the INT1 season stations 44301, 2719001 and 3118069 were
   established as having significant changes, while in the SWM season
   station 2917001 and during the INT2 season, the stations 2615131 and
   44301 showed significant trends. It is worth mentioning that the maximum
   rainfall occurs in inter-monsoon seasons.},

Title = {When will trends in European mean and heavy daily precipitation emerge?},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {A multi-model ensemble of regional climate projections for Europe is
   employed to investigate how the time of emergence (TOE) for seasonal
   sums and maxima of daily precipitation depends on spatial scale. The TOE
   is redefined for emergence from internal variability only; the spread of
   the TOE due to imperfect climate model formulation is used as a measure
   of uncertainty in the TOE itself. Thereby, the TOE becomes a
   fundamentally limiting timescale and translates into a minimum spatial
   scale on which robust conclusions can be drawn about precipitation
   trends. Thus, minimum temporal and spatial scales for adaptation
   planning are also given. In northern Europe, positive winter trends in
   mean and heavy precipitation, and in southwestern and southeastern
   Europe, summer trends in mean precipitation already emerge within the
   next few decades. However, across wide areas, especially for heavy
   summer precipitation, the local trend emerges only late in the 21st
   century or later. For precipitation averaged to larger scales, the
   trend, in general, emerges earlier.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {590},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study undertakes a spatio-temporal assessment of the annual and
   seasonal precipitation trends over the Desaguadero-Poopo (DP) system in
   Bolivia for the period 1981-2018. Given the insufficient spatial density
   of meteorological stations in the study, the high-spatial resolution
   Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)
   satellite product was used. CHIRPS precipitation data was validated
   against 7,636 gauge measurements and used to map the spatial
   distribution of precipitation trends. In addition, the temporal changes
   in the onset, duration and average intensity of the wet season were
   explored. Results showed a good, statistically significant agreement
   between CHIRPS data and onsite records of monthly precipitation at the
   pixel and regional scales. The spatio-temporal precipitation assessment
   revealed that statistically significant increases in annual
   precipitation (2-6 mm yr(-1)) occurred in two zones at the north and
   north-western part of the DP system. Only the southern part showed
   decreasing precipitation trends at a rate of -1 mm yr(-1) while the
   central part did not show significant changes. Overall, a general
   increasing trend of about 2.5 mm yr(-1) was observed for the entire DP
   system during the 38-year study period, with the months of December and
   February showing the highest significant increases. The analysis of the
   onset and cessation times of the rainy season indicated a statistically
   significant decrease in its duration at a rate of -0.4 day yr(-1) and an
   increment of the average precipitation intensity. Our results reveal
   trend in the temporal concentration of precipitation in a water scarce
   region, which highlights the need for the management of the resource, so
   it can meet societal and environmental demands throughout the year.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal precipitation variability in Chhattisgarh State in
   India was examined by using monthly precipitation data for 102 years
   (1901-2002) from 16 stations. The homogeneity of precipitation data was
   evaluated by the double-mass curve approach and the presence of serial
   correlation by lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient. Linear regression
   analysis, the conventional Mann-Kendall (MK) test, and Spearman's rho
   were employed to identify trends and Sen's slope to estimate the slope
   of trend line. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to analyze
   precipitation variability. Spatial interpolation was done by a Kriging
   process using ArcGIS 9.3. Results of both parametric and non-parametric
   tests and trend tests showed that at 5 \% significance level, annual
   precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend at all stations except
   Bilaspur and Dantewada. For both annual and monsoon precipitation, Sen's
   test showed a decreasing trend for all stations, except Bilaspur and
   Dantewada. The highest percentage of variability was observed in winter
   precipitation (88.75 \%) and minimum percentage variability in annual
   series (14.01 \%) over the 102-year periods.},

   explain these spatial patterns, focussing on changes in means and
   extremes for the period 1951-2009. To investigate different
   possibilities for the causes of spatial variations, a distinction was
   made between six regions based on mean precipitation, soil type and
   elevation, and four zones at different distances to the coast. Spatial
   maxima in mean precipitation inland and over elevated areas are mainly
   formed in winter and spring, while maxima along the coast are generated
   in autumn. Daily precipitation maxima are found in the central West
   coast and over elevated areas. Upward trends in daily precipitation are
   highest from February to April and lowest from July to September. The
   strongest and most significant increases are found along the coast. For
   several seasonal and climatological periods diverging behaviour between
   coastal and inland zones is observed. We find that distance to the coast
   gives a more consistent picture for the seasonal precipitation changes
   than a classification based on surface characteristics. Therefore, from
   the investigated surface factors, we consider sea surface temperature to
   have the largest influence on precipitation in The Netherlands.},

Title = {Consistency in Global Climate Change Model Predictions of Regional
   Precipitation Trends},
Journal = {EARTH INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {13},
Abstract = {Projections of human-induced climate change impacts arising from the
   emission of atmospheric chemical constituents such as carbon dioxide
   typically utilize multiple integrations (or ensembles) of numerous
   numerical climate change models to arrive at multimodel ensembles from
   which mean and median values and probabilities can be inferred about the
   response of various components of the observed climate system. Some
   responses are considered reliable in as much as the simulated responses
   show consistency within ensembles and across models. Other
   responses-particularly at regional levels and for certain parameters
   such as precipitation-show little intermodel consistency even in the
   sign of the projected climate changes. The authors' results show that in
   these regions the consistency in the sign of projected precipitation
   variations is greater for intramodel runs (e. g., runs from the same
   model) than intermodel runs (e. g., runs from different models),
   indicating that knowledge of the internal ``dynamics{''} of the climate
   system can provide additional skill in making projections of climate
   change. Given the consistency provided by the governing dynamics of the
   model, the authors test whether persistence from an individual model
   trajectory serves as a good predictor for its own behavior by the end of
   the twenty-first century. Results indicate that, in certain regions
   where intermodel consistency is low, the short-term trends of individual
   model trajectories do provide additional skill in making projections of
   long-term climate change. The climate forcing for which this forecast
   skill becomes relatively large (e. g., correct in 75\% of the individual
   model runs) is equivalent to the anthropogenic climate forcing imposed
   over the past century, suggesting that observed changes in precipitation
   in these regions can provide guidance about the direction of future
   precipitation changes over the course of the next century.},

Abstract = {Many climate studies in Mozambique have clearly identified signals of
   climate change, especially changes in the extreme temperatures.
   Regarding precipitation, there is still a gap on the knowledge of how it
   is behaving due to both internal and external factors in the climate
   system. In this study, we have investigated the existence of long-term
   correlations and trend in time series of precipitation. Two databases
   were used for this purpose: in situ observations along the period of
   1960-2020 and the Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with
   Stations (CHIRPS) dataset, along the period from 1981 to 2021. We have
   applied the rescaled-range analysis and the detrended fluctuation
   analysis for long memory investigation, and the linear regression and
   Mann-Kendall methods for trend analysis. Results have shown the
   existence of long memory in precipitation in most parts of Mozambique,
   being stronger in the southern and central regions and weakening toward
   the north of the country. On the other hand, significant trend signals
   of precipitation were detected in some isolated areas of Mozambique,
   presenting an increase in some regions such as the southern part of
   Manica and eastern of Inhambane provinces and a decrease in other
   regions such as the coastal areas of Zambezia and Nampula. These
   findings indicate that the probability of a random occurrence of
   precipitation is minimal, and the observed trends are likely to continue
   for a long period in future. Dry land agriculture should be prepared to
   adapt to new precipitation regime in the regions mentioned hereof.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the climate in North and Northeast Brazil has
   undergone significant changes, which indicate potential risks for water
   and food security due to increasing temperatures, changing precipitation
   patterns, and greater frequency of some extreme events. For example,
   there is evidence of changes in the strength of the hydrological cycles
   on North and Northeast Brazil river basins, but the magnitude and
   extension of the precipitation changes are highly dependent on the
   precipitation dataset under consideration and the methodology. Here, we
   analyze the precipitation trends in North and Northeast Brazil
   hydrological basins and the possible associated mechanisms and present
   the rainfall climatological cycles in these basins using multi-datasets.
   The results showed that, in most river basins, there is a clear
   distinction between the rainy and dry seasons, with a contrast between
   the basins of the North (which receive a higher amount of rainfall) and
   the Northeast Brazil (with low rainfall volume, especially in the
   Parnaiba and Eastern Northeast Atlantic basins). Moreover, the annual
   rainfall has undergone an increasing trend in western Brazil river
   basins and a decreasing trend in the eastern. This east-west dipole is
   associated with the strengthening (weakening) of the Walker and Hadley
   circulations in western (eastern) Brazil in recent decades. A
   multidecadal variability is seen to modulate the precipitation changes,
   which is in phase with the AMO cycle. CMIP6 detection and attribution
   experiments showed that both natural and anthropogenic factors can play
   a role in the recent changes observed in northern Brazil river basins.},

Abstract = {Precipitation in southwestern France was analyzed. Monthly rainfall data
   from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) were used to
   obtain three clusters of average precipitation from May through
   September for the period 1901-2010. We attempt to understand the role of
   hailfalls in total precipitation using three different variables related
   to hail, the number of hail days, hail frequency, and intensity. We
   examine trends via the Mann-Kendall test and periodicities by wavelet
   analysis. The results show cluster classification of precipitation to be
   somewhat consistent with hailpad networks in the study area. In the
   Pyrenees, there was a nonsignificant negative trend of precipitation and
   a substantial increase of hail days and intensity of hail, which were
   close to the limit of significance. Finally, a wavelet coherence
   analysis shows a strong influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) in the Atlantic region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Trend and variability of China's summer precipitation during 1955-2008
   are examined. The results show that (1) summer precipitation has
   significantly increased in South China and significantly decreased in
   North China, while there are no significant trends in the West and China
   overall; (2) interannual variability is greatly intensified all over
   China with more wet and dry extreme years in the second bin (1977-2008)
   than in the first bin (1955-1976). Covariability between China's summer
   precipitation and the Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) is analysed
   using singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. The first mode of
   SVD displays an El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-like SST pattern,
   the associated precipitation shows negative anomalies in North China;
   the second mode exhibitsSST fluctuations in the western and central
   Pacific that corresponding to positive anomalies in South China. In
   addition, cooling over the mid-lower reaches of Yangtze River basin
   (i.e. South-central China) might also contribute to decreased
   (increased) summer precipitation in North (South) China. The percentages
   of variance of summer precipitation and SST explained by each mode
   suggest that the increased variability of the second SVD mode in the
   second bin is consistent with intensified variability of China's summer
   precipitation in the same period. (c) 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2317-2328},
Abstract = {River systems in semiarid regions are susceptible to rapid and dramatic
   channel erosion and arroyo formation. Climate plays an important role in
   arroyo development through changes in precipitation intensity,
   seasonality, and variability. Here, trends in precipitation and
   streamflow at the annual, monthly, and daily timescales for the last 50
   yr are analyzed for the Rio Puerco Basin in northwestern New Mexico, and
   connections with recent watershed and channel changes are examined. The
   increasing trend in annual precipitation in the basin is shown to be
   part of larger-scale climatic variability that affects the U.S.
   Southwest region, which is associated with climatic anomalies in the
   northern Pacific. Results of hydroclimatic data analyses point to a
   general increase in wetness in nonsummer months-an increase in the
   number of rainy days and in the frequency of flow days in the stream
   system is observed. There are substantial shifts in the distributions of
   both daily precipitation and streamflow. Rainfall with moderate
   intensity has been increasing, while the intensity of annual maximum
   rainfall events has remained largely unaffected. At the same time, the
   number of annual maximum runoff events in the basin has been steadily
   decreasing in the studied period. It is argued that recent watershed and
   arroyo changes that affect the rainfall-runoff relationship in the basin
   may be responsible for the decreasing trend in maximum runoff events.
   Field evidence of such changes in the Rio Puerco watershed and fluvial
   system is discussed.},

Abstract = {Heavy precipitation events often lead to river floods and flash floods
   causing significant loss of life and property damage, landslide
   activation, and other social and economic problems. The upward tendency
   of damages, caused by natural disasters, supports the idea that extreme
   events, associated with the effects of climate change, have recently
   occurred with greater frequency. The series of hazardous precipitation
   events which affected the Balkans and in particular Bulgaria in 2005
   show that further study of such type of phenomena is necessary in order
   to improve their predictability.
   The subject of the present study is the variability and the trends
   associated with extreme precipitation events in Bulgaria during the
   period 1961-2005. Total precipitation amounts exceeding 30 mm/day which
   occur in 4 or more provinces of the country are considered to be risky
   for floods. We call them here heavy-rain days or events. The regime of
   such potentially dangerous heavy-rain/snow events is compared to those
   of total precipitation amounts for two periods: 1961-1990 and 1991-2005.
   Significant increase (more than 32\%) of the days with heavy 24-hour
   precipitation is revealed during the second period, while the total
   annual rainfall is almost without changes or shows a slightly decreasing
   trend in many regions of the country. Besides, the contribution of heavy
   and torrential rain/snow to the observed annual precipitation totals
   increases. It is in contrast with the observed trend of decrease for the
   weak and moderate precipitation amounts.
   Two typical synoptic situations, leading to such type of extreme events
   in the extreme year 2005 are presented. The first is a ``winter{''} one
   in February and the second - a ``summer{''} one in July. (c) 2008

Abstract = {The spatial variations of trends of relevant extreme precipitation
   indices were examined for 138 rainfall stations in South Africa for the
   period 1910 to 2004, a follow-up study of various others on
   precipitation trends in the region. This study aims to inform on trends
   in daily extreme precipitation indices, over as long a period with
   instrumental data as possible. while also retaining as sufficient a
   spatial coverage of results as possible. Data should also be forthcoming
   from climate stations with the time series spanning the complete study
   period, avoiding patching of data which can cause in homogeneities. Some
   significant changes in indices, averaged over specific areas in South
   Africa, could be identified. These include areas with significant
   increases and decreases in annual precipitation, increases in the
   longest annual dry spell indicating more extreme dry seasons, increases
   in the longest annual wet spells indicating more extreme wet seasons,
   and increases in high daily precipitation amounts. The conclusion is
   that, while in the largest part of South Africa there has been no real
   evidence of changes in precipitation over the past century, there are
   however some identifiable areas where significant changes in certain
   characteristics of precipitation have occurred over the period 1910 to
   2004. Copyright (C) 2006 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Abstract = {Trends in monthly heavy precipitation, defined by a return period of one
   year, are assessed for statistical significance in observations and
   Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations over the contiguous United States
   using Monte Carlo non-parametric and parametric boot-strapping
   techniques. The results from the two Monte Carlo approaches are found to
   be similar to each other, and also to the traditional non-parametric
   Kendall's tau test, implying the robustness of the approach. Two
   different observational data-sets are employed to test for trends in
   monthly heavy precipitation and are found to exhibit consistent results.
   Both data-sets demonstrate upward trends, one of which is found to be
   statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level. Upward trends
   similar to observations are observed in some climate model simulations
   of the twentieth century, but their statistical significance is
   marginal. For projections of the twenty-first century, a statistically
   significant upwards trend is observed in most of the climate models
   analyzed. The change in the simulated precipitation variance appears to
   be more important in the twenty-first century projections than changes
   in the mean precipitation. Stochastic fluctuations of the climate-system
   are found to be dominate monthly heavy precipitation as some GCM
   simulations show a downwards trend even in the twenty-first century
   projections when the greenhouse gas forcings are strong.},

Title = {Trend analysis of extreme precipitation events across Iran using

Volume = {41},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Although a number of studies have been conducted on extreme
   precipitation trends in different parts of the world including Iran, a
   great number of such studies have reported only the total amount of
   daily precipitation greater than a certain percentage (e.g., 95\%) of
   the long term data (R95p), ignoring other useful indices. To address
   this research gap, we used other modified indices, namely
   R95(tot)(fractional contribution of very wet days to annual total
   amounts), R95(tt)(fractional contribution of very wet days to the total
   annual obtained from fitted gamma probability distribution), and RS95
   (same as R95(tt)except that it uses Weibull distribution and very wet
   days defined by 95 percentage of an individual year) by which the
   spatial and temporal changes of very wet days across Iran was assessed,
   1985-2013. In addition, to evaluate the effect of the selected
   distribution on the results, a new index-(RS95(gm))-was introduced and
   reported. This index is similar to RS95, except that it uses gamma
   distribution instead of Weibull. According to trend analysis of R95p,
   R95(tot), and R95(tt), reduced frequency of extreme precipitation events
   was detected in some northwest, west and northeast parts of Iran. On the
   contrary, RS95 (RS95(gm)) results showed a higher frequency of extreme
   events across Iran. It was also demonstrated that while R95p, R95(tot),
   and R95(tt)were unequivocally affected by changes in the mean wet-day/
   annual total precipitation, RS95 (RS95(gm)) was more influenced by
   changes in the distributional shape, showing more stable trends.
   Although RS95 and RS95(gm)were highly correlated with only 19\%
   difference on average, their trend analysis results were not completely
   consistent (70\% agreement). Thus, it may be concluded that any changes
   in statistical distribution in the calculation of the RS95 would have a
   considerable effect on whether the obtained trend is significant or not.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the spatiotemporal trend variability of precipitation
   days (PDs) in the southeast Tibetan Plateau (STP) from 1961 to 2012 is
   studied on annual and seasonal timescales for the first time. According
   to the results of the Mann-Kendall (M-K) test, the annual and seasonal
   area-averaged PDs shows a non-significant tendency except for spring
   PDs, and the spring PDs shows a significantly increased trend at 95\%
   confidence level during this period. The increase is 6.85 days per 100
   years in annual PDs. The maximal increase occurs in spring, which is
   7.13 days per 100 years. On the other hand, the PDs and their tendencies
   have notable spatial distribution variations over the STP. The PDs have
   some relationship with altitude, but their tendencies are unrelated to
   altitude in the STP. This study further finds that the Nujiang River is
   a dividing line for the PDs, and latitude 30 degrees N is such a line
   for the PDs tendency. The results revealed the local differences of the
   PDs over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is beneficial to understand the
   variations in precipitation patterns in the STP and gain insights into
   the change features of the TP under global changes.},

Abstract = {Based on the daily rainfall data since 1889 in Curitiba, one of the
   largest cities in southern Brazil, a trend towards increased
   precipitation and more intense rainfall can be seen. The annual and
   seasonal volume of rainfall has increased, amounts greater than 10, 20
   and 40mm being observed more often, but with a reduction in the number
   of rainy days and the number of days with rainfall below 10mm. Seasonal
   95th percentile series have increased in summer, fall and winter. In
   addition, several indices of climate extremes presented significant
   increasing trends: monthly maximum 1-day precipitation, annual total
   precipitation greater than 95th and 99th percentiles, number of
   consecutive dry days and the daily intensity index. Generalized extreme
   value (GEV) distribution function parameters also indicated higher
   occurrence of extremes detected by the increase in both the scale
   parameter sigma and the location parameter in summer, fall and winter.
   The return time for severe rainfall declined in the second half of the
   period compared to the first, indicating more frequent occurrence of
   future extreme events. The main climate indices affecting the 95th
   percentile series were sea surface temperature (SST), South Atlantic
   Convergence Zone (SACZ) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) during
   spring, and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Large-Scale Index
   for South America Monsoon (LISAM) and SOI during the summer, which
   explained variability of the extremes at around 20 and 13\%,
   respectively in each season. Regarding the variability of summer, fall
   and spring total rainfall, they presented values around 20\% for the
   explained variance due to climate indices. Other factors should be
   investigated to explain the variability such as urbanization, air
   pollution and local circulations. Dominant oscillation periods in the
   time series constructed with one monthly extreme appeared at 3 to 8-year
   (inter-annual) cycles, with 12years (decadal) and around 30-64years on
   the inter-decadal scale. These oscillations have resonance with SOI,
   SACZ and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) indices (high frequencies), and
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and AMO (low frequency).},

   precipitation of moderate and heavy rainfall events did not change at
   most observatories, or showed a decreasing trend in these events. There
   was very large spatial and seasonal variability, with implications for
   water management and risk assessment in the region. The decrease in
   precipitation was very marked in headwaters during winter and spring,
   potentially affecting reservoir management in the region. Heavy rainfall
   events generally decreased in the west of the region in winter, and in
   the east of the region in autumn, when these areas are more exposed to
   hazards related to extreme rainfall. Large differences in the sign and
   magnitude of trends occurred over very short distances, suggesting the
   need for dense networks of observatories to ensure reliable and robust
   detection of regional trends. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological

Title = {Trends of Heavy Precipitation Events in Global Observation and

Journal = {SOLA},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {96-99},
Abstract = {Trends of heavy-precipitation events represented by available global
   observations such as the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP)
   and four global reanalysis datasets are examined using two indices, OPC
   (occurrence of rainy days within precipitation class) and NPC
   (normalized precipitation within precipitation class), mainly over the
   tropics. These indices are defined by normalization with the total
   integrated precipitation amount for the analysis period, 1979-2001.
   Over land, the observational datasets exhibit larger decreasing trends
   in the heavier classes. All but one of the reanalysis datasets reproduce
   these tendencies. Significant correlations for the heaviest class
   between the GPCP and the other datasets can be found.
   Over sea, there was a large discontinuity around 1987 in the two indices
   for the GPCP pentad data, which was probably caused by the introduction
   of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data. Restricted to data
   after 1988, all of the reanalysis datasets are seen to have positive and
   more increasing tendencies in the heavier classes, while the
   observational results show the opposite tendencies, although they are
   statistically insignificant.
   To resolve this discrepancy in order to enable the use of reanalysis
   data in extreme-event studies, additional improvements will be needed,
   not only in reanalysis but also in observational datasets.},

Number = {1-2},
Pages = {117-129},
Abstract = {k-day extreme precipitation depths (k = 1,2,3,...30) for the
   climatological network of Belgium (165 stations) are analysed to detect
   a possible evolution in the occurrence of extreme rainfall events during
   the 1951-1995 reference period. The calendar year and the hydrological
   summer and winter are considered separately. Spearman's rank correlation
   coefficient shows a strong spatial correlation between extreme k-day
   precipitation events, depending on the time of the year (lower during
   summer than during winter) and increasing with k. In some cases the
   distances of decorrelation exceed 200 km which is comparable to the size
   of the country. Due to this correlation, tests for trends have been
   carried out on the leading principal components (PC) derived from the
   covariance matrix. Various PC selection rules have been applied to
   identify the number of components to analyse. The number of components
   needed to reproduce a given proportion of the total variance varies,
   with larger values for summer than fur winter and a decrease with
   growing k. The Fisher test is used as a global test. It combines the
   individual Mann-Kendall trend tests carried out on the selected PC
   scores. Significant trends have been found in extreme winter k-day
   precipitation for all the values of k and none in extreme summer
   precipitation. The results fur the annual k-day precipitation depths are
   between those for the two seasons: no trend for small k because summer
   events dominate and a significant trend fur k larger than 7 due to the
   winter events. Analysis of a few stations with long-term series shows no
   significant trend for the period 1910-1995, these series also reproduce
   almost the same trends as those found for the shorter 1951-1995 period.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change are unparalleled in magnitude, ranging
   from changing weather patterns that endanger food production to
   increasing sea levels that increase the likelihood of catastrophic
   flooding. Therefore, determining the extent of such variations on
   regional and local scales is imperative. We used monthly precipitation
   data from 25 meteorological stations in northern Pakistan (NP) to
   document the observed changes in seasonal and annual precipitation. The
   station density in the NP is small and unevenly distributed; therefore,
   ERA-5 reanalysis data were used to supplement the observed dataset to
   assess the spatial trends in NP. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK),
   Sen's Slope estimator (SSE), and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) tests
   were performed to assess the trends. In addition, the wavelet analysis
   technique was used to determine the association of precipitation with
   various oceanic indices from 1960 to 2016. Results indicate that maximum
   precipitation was shown in the annual and summer seasons. In NP, annual,
   winter, spring, and summer precipitation declined, while an increase in
   autumn was observed at a rate of 0.43 mm/decade between 1989 and 2016.
   The spatial trends for observed and ERA-5 reanalysis datasets were
   almost similar in winter, spring, and autumn; however, some disagreement
   was observed in both datasets in the summer and annual precipitation
   trends in NP during 1960-2016. Between 1989 and 2016, summer and annual
   precipitation increased significantly in Region III. However, seasonal
   and annual precipitation decreased in NP between 1960 and 2016.
   Moreover, there were no prominent trends in annual precipitation until
   the mid-1980s, but an apparent increase from 1985 onwards. Annual
   precipitation increased in all elevations except at the 500-1000 m zone.
   The ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) shared notable interannual
   coherences among all indices above 16-64 months. Inter-decadal coherence
   with the ENSO, AO (Arctic Oscillation), and PDO (Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation) in NP for 128 months and above. Generally, AO, AMO
   (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), and NAO (North Atlantic
   Oscillation) exhibited less coherence with precipitation in NP. The
   regression of seasonal and annual precipitation revealed that winter and
   spring precipitation levels had higher linear regression with the AO and
   ENSO, respectively, while both the AO and ENSO also dominated at the
   annual scale. Similarly, the IOD and PDO indices had a higher influence
   in summer precipitation. The findings may help water resource managers
   and climate researchers develop a contingency plan for better water
   resource management policies in the face of changing climate change in
   Pakistan, particularly in NP.},

Abstract = {The trends in annual precipitation and wind induced by tropical cyclones
   (TCs) over Shanghai during the last 40 years are estimated. Results
   indicate that there is a significant increasing trend in the annual
   total precipitation induced by TCs, which is related to the significant
   positive trends in daily precipitation and annual torrential rain days.
   Meanwhile, a significant decreasing trend shows in maximum sustained
   wind, which seems to be related to the downward trend in the intensity
   of TCs when affecting Shanghai. The annual frequencies of affected TCs,
   TC translation speed and distance from Shanghai when affecting Shanghai
   have no obvious tendency. The different trends in precipitation and wind
   suggested that a more comprehensive metric for assessing TCs' influence

Title = {Innovative trend analysis of annual precipitation in Serbia during
   1946-2019},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To better plan how to solve the water-related issues directly connected
   with the variability in precipitation, it is necessary to understand
   trend changes in precipitation. The innovative trend analysis (ITA)
   method and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test were used to analyze historical
   precipitation changes at 28 synoptic stations for the period 1946-2019
   in Serbia. The stability of the trends is determined using the partial
   MK trend test. The monotonic characteristic of the trend components is
   also checked by classifying the time series into three value groups and
   applying the ITA method. Results of both models (ITA and MK) showed that
   the southwestern part of Serbia that is a mountainous region has the
   greatest increasing trend over the country. An increasing gradient from
   east to west in precipitation trend is observed. The spatial pattern of
   precipitation trend for the total time series showed that the
   southeastern and southwestern parts have the lowest (negative) and
   highest (positive) trends, respectively. Only two stations, Negotin and
   Vranje, showed instability in the calculated trends. The monotonic
   analysis indicated that half of stations (14 stations) have monotonic
   trend components, while the trend components of the other half are
   non-monotonic. The trends for three stations, including Zrenjanin,
   Kikinda, and Valjevo are recognized to be non-significant by the ITA
   method; while the MK test determined more stations with no significant
   trend. So, the ITA method is found to be more sensitive in finding
   hidden trends than the MK trend test.},

Abstract = {How to accurately detect and estimate the significance level of trends
   in hydroclimate time series is a challenge. Building on correlation
   analysis, we propose an approach for evaluating and grading the
   significance level of trend in a series, and apply it to evaluate the
   changes in annual precipitation in China. The approach involved first
   formulating the relationship between the correlation coefficient and
   trend's slope. Four correlation coefficient thresholds are then
   determined by considering the influence of significance levels and data
   length, and the significance of trends is graded as five levels: no,
   weak, moderate, strong and dramatic. A larger correlation coefficient
   reflects a larger slope of trend and its higher significance level.
   Results of Monte-Carlo experiments indicated that the correlation
   coefficient-based approach not only reflects the magnitude of a trend,
   but also considers the influence of dispersion degree and mean value of
   the original series. Compared with the Mann-Kendall test used commonly,
   the proposed approach gave more accurate and specific gradation of the
   significance level of trends in annual precipitation over China. We find
   that the precipitation trends over China are not uniform, and the
   effects of global climate change on precipitation are not strong and
   limited to some regions.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of precipitation and drought will play a significant role
   in the future development and sustainable management of water resources.
   It is the main purpose of this paper to analyse meteorological droughts
   and trends. The variability of the standardized precipitation index
   (SPI) was investigated at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 monthly intervals. The
   trends of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 monthly SPI results were analysed by
   applying linear regression and the Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho tests
   at the 5\% significance level. The linear slopes of the trends were
   calculated with a technique proposed by Sen. Meteorological data from
   eight meteorological stations in the Aegean region of Turkey were used
   for the period 1960-2013.
   The monthly precipitation trend decreases in December, January, February
   and March in all regions according to the linear regression analysis
   results. Annual precipitation decreased at five stations. In drought
   analysis by the SPI, in a short time period (such as 3months) drought is
   more frequent but shorter, and as the period increases the duration of
   drought also increases but frequency decreases. Winter droughts are
   beginning to occur in the class of severe' in recent years. In this
   study carried out for different time periods according to SPI values in
   all stations, the highest ranges are in the normal and mild drought
   degrees. In addition, severe and extreme droughts are also seen
   intensely frequently. Trend analysis of precipitation and drought is
   compared. The trend analyses of precipitation are in parallel with the
   results of drought analyses.},

Title = {Trends in seasonal precipitation extremes and associated temperatures
   along continental Chile},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 30},
Abstract = {We characterize trends in maximum seasonal daily precipitation (seasonal
   Rx1day), minimum (Tn), and maximum (Tx) daily temperatures during days
   with precipitation over continental Chile for the period 1979-2017,
   using surface stations and the AgERA5 gridded product derived from the
   ERA5 reanalysis dataset. We also examine seasonal trends of Sea Surface
   Temperature (SST), Precipitable Water (PW), Convective Available
   Potential Energy (CAPE), Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE), Atmospheric Rivers
   (ARs) frequency, and upper air observations to seek possible mechanisms
   that explain precipitation trends. Our results show an increase in
   seasonal Rx1day during fall in the south part of Northern Chile (15-30
   degrees S) and during fall and winter in Austral Chile (45-57 degrees
   S), and mostly negative trends in Central Chile (30-36 degrees S), where
   a few locations with positive trends along the coast during summer.
   Temperature trends presented cooling patterns north of 33 degrees S in
   almost all the seasons (< -2 degrees C/dec), while warming trends
   prevail south of 38 degrees S (> 1 degrees C/dec). The highest values in
   Tn trends are obtained on the western slopes of the Andes around 30
   degrees S. We also explore temperature scaling in surface stations,
   finding strong positive super Clausius Clapeyron with Tn, especially
   between fall and spring in the 33-40 degrees S region. Sounding
   observations in five stations across Chile suggest warming trends at
   23.5 degrees, 33 degrees S, and 53 degrees S, with a stabilization
   effect by enhanced warming in the upper troposphere, while presenting
   cooling trends in Puerto Montt (41.5 degrees S). Seasonal trends in PW
   reveal moistening along southern Peru and northern Chile during spring
   and summer. Positive trends in CAPE are observed over 35-40 degrees S
   (austral summer and fall) and the north Altiplano (autumn). SST analyses
   reveal strong cooling around 30 degrees S in winter, which may explain
   the negative trends in seasonal Rx1day in central Chile. A warming spot
   on the northern Peruvian coast during fall may be responsible for
   humidification in front of Northern Chile, particularly during summer
   and fall. Positive EKE trends are detected south of 40 degrees S, being
   stronger and reaching almost all of the coast during spring. ARs
   frequency unveils negative trends up to -5 days/dec during summer and
   positive trends of 1 day/dec in 40 degrees- 50 degrees S coastal regions
   during spring. More generally, the results presented here shed light on
   the main large-scale processes driving recent trends in precipitation
   extremes across continental Chile.},

Abstract = {The acidity of the precipitation in China as well as the area affected
   by acidic raimfalls have increased in the years, along with the rapid
   economic growth in china. Field observations indicate that acid
   precipitation often occur are the southern par, of china, although the
   emissiors of the precursors are stronger in the North. In this paper, we
   explain the geographical distribution of acid precipitation in china,
   based on the content alkaline ions in soil,soil acidity, atmospheric
   particulate concentration, aerosol buffering capacity and atmospheric
   dispersion. It is further anticipated that continuous increasing of
   sulfur emissions in the North will eventually result in acid rain in the
   northern part of China On the basis of the projection of SO2 and No
   emissions, it is argued that the problem of acid precipitation may get
   worse towers the year 2020, if expenditure on emission control maintains
   at current level.},

Abstract = {A study has been conducted on frequency of western disturbances (WDs)
   and variability of precipitation over J\&K during the period 1980 to
   2019. The frequency of WD's from November to April during study period
   was determined and results showed that total 600 WD's cases were
   observed. The WD frequencies showed significant decreasing trend
   (p<0.01) during November and March with slope values -0.610 and -2.748
   respectively and increasing trends during January (0.417) and February
   (2.795) mm/month slope value (p<0.01). The results of precipitation
   trends using Mann-Kendall statistical tests showed significant
   decreasing trends for Kupwara in the month of December and March and
   Gulmarg in the month of March with a slope value of -2.450 \& -2.947 and
   -6.947 mm/month respectively. No significant trends were observed for
   other stations. The results of Innovative trend analysis showed
   decreasing significant trends for the month of November and December for
   most of the stations with slope ranging from -0.288 (Jammu) to -1.978
   (Srinagar) mm/month. Gulmarg, Batote, Baderwah, and Katra showed
   significant decreasing trends for the month of January with slope values
   -2.311, -1.221, -0.737 and -0.917 mm/month respectively. Significant
   increasing trends were observed in the month of February for the
   stations Kukernag, Kupwara, Srinagar, Banihal, Batote and Baderwah with
   slope values 1.267, 1.958, 1.040, 2.231 and 1.058 mm/month respectively
   with p value <0.01. Except Kukernag (2.348 mm/month), all the stations
   showed decreasing trend for the month of April. The results of Pearson
   correlation showed that Precipitation of Baderwah, Katra, Qazigund and
   Srinagar station is positively correlated (0.351, 0.370, 0.357, 0.369)
   with WD frequency of December with significant at p<0.05, Kupwara for
   the month of January (0.436) and Batote for the month of March (0.363).
   The correlation between average precipitation of all the stations and

Abstract = {Long series of climate observations are essential to understand past and
   present climate change. However, the study of climate change from raw
   instrumental data poses a number of specific problems. Firstly, any
   observations are likely to contain erroneous values. Secondly,
   measurement conditions have generally changed over time which may
   introduce artificial breaks in the data that do not reflect the real
   variations of the climate. This article presents a new dataset of
   quality controlled and homogenized monthly precipitation series for
   Belgium. After in-depth data quality control, monthly precipitation time
   series have been homogenized with the HOMER software on the basis of
   available metadata. Homogenization results are provided for 110 series
   over the period 1951-2019 and for 18 series starting before 1912
   including nine covering the full time period 1880-2019. The new dataset
   of monthly homogenized series allows us to make a robust analysis of the
   precipitation evolution in Belgium from 1880 to nowadays. The comparison
   between the average of the last 30 years (1990-2019) with that of the
   first 30 years (1880-1909) of the considered time period, reveals an
   average increase in precipitation in the order of 15.5\%. However, this
   average representation of the increase masks important seasonal and
   regional differences across Belgium.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the trends of extreme daily rainfall indices over
   three meteorological stations located in the eastern region of
   Bangladesh from 1960 to 2000. The climate change-related indices
   included frequency-based indices: number of heavy rainfall days and
   consecutive dry and wet days, and intensity-based indices: annual
   wet-day rainfall total, daily and consecutive five-day maximum rainfall,
   very and extremely wet days and simple daily intensity index. The
   magnitude of trends in extreme rainfall indices time series was
   determined using the nonparametric Sen's slope estimator method, and the
   statistical significance of the trends was analyzed using the
   Mann-Kendall test. The rainfall trends exhibited regional patterns.
   Overall, results suggested an increase in annual rainfall over the study
   area; however, a tendency toward reduction of rainfall in the wet season
   was observed. Analysis of extreme rainfall indices demonstrated
   non-significant increase in frequency of heavy rainfall days, decrease
   in consecutive dry days and increase in consecutive wet days coupled
   with regional decline in daily and consecutive five-day maximum rainfall
   in the monsoon.},

Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in precipitation
   (1997-2003) and in the atmospheric gas phase (1996-2003) collected in
   Chicago, IL, are reported. These data were obtained as part of the
   Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network. For comparison, PCB
   concentrations at a remote site, Sleeping Bear Dunes on the northeastern
   shore of Lake Michigan, are also reported. Much higher PCB
   concentrations in both precipitation (7.1 +/- 0.9 ng/L) and the gas
   phase (1.4 +/- 0.1 ng/m(3)) at Chicago compared to Sleeping Bear Dunes
   (1.1 +/- 0.1 ng/L and 0.1 +/- 0.08 ng/m3, respectively) indicate that
   Chicago is a source of PCBs to the Great Lakes. A long-term decreasing
   trend of PCB concentrations in precipitation was observed at Chicago
   with a half-life of 6.8 +/- 3.1 years. The corresponding half-life for
   PCB concentrations in the gas phase was 7.7 +/- 1.1 years. The
   significant long-term decrease of PCB concentrations in precipitation
   and the gas phase in Chicago suggests that regulatory efforts are
   working, at least in this city.},

Abstract = {A novel method to adjust the precipitation produced by atmospheric
   reanalyses using observational constraints to force ocean models is
   described. The method allows the preservation of the qualities of the
   high-resolution and high-frequency output from the reanalyses while
   eliminating their bias and spurious trends. The method is shown to be
   robust to degradation in both space and time of the observation dataset.
   This method is applied to the ERA-Interim precipitation dataset using
   the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) v2.3 as the
   observational reference in order to create a debiased dataset that can
   be used to force ocean models. The produced debiased dataset is then
   compared to ERA-Interim and GPCP in a suite of forced ice-ocean
   numerical experiments using the GFDL OM4 model. Ocean states obtained
   with the new precipitation dataset are consistent with results from
   GPCP-forced experiments with respect to global metrics but produces the
   extra sea surface salinity variability at the time scales unresolved by
   the observation-based dataset. Discrepancies between modeled and
   observed freshwater fluxes are discussed as well as the strategies to
   mitigate them and their impacts.},

Abstract = {Based on daily rainfall data from 26 station records, spatial and
   temporal variations in annual and seasonal precipitation of different
   rainfall intensities from 1961 to 2018 in Ningxia, China are
   investigated using the innovative trend analysis (ITA) method. The
   results show that annual precipitation increases on the northern plain
   but decreases in the southern mountainous area. The increase in regional
   annual precipitation is mainly due to an increase in weak precipitation,
   while the decrease in regional annual rainfall is a result of a
   reduction in heavy precipitation. Low-intensity precipitation shows an
   upward trend, while high-intensity precipitation shows a downward trend.
   The variation trend of extreme precipitation is more obvious. The
   contributions of different types of extreme precipitation vary by
   season. During spring, the increase in regional rainfall is mainly
   caused by the increase in heavy precipitation, while the decrease in
   regional precipitation is mainly caused by the decrease in weak
   precipitation. During summer and autumn, the increase in regional
   precipitation is caused by the increase in light precipitation, while
   the reduction in regional rainfall is caused by the decrease in heavy
   precipitation. This study provides support for water resources planning
   and addressing droughts and floods.},

Abstract = {Significant increases of heavy precipitation and decreases of light
   precipitation have been reported over widespread regions of the globe.
   Global warming and effects of anthropogenic aerosols have both been
   proposed as possible causes of these changes. We examine data from urban
   and rural meteorological stations in eastern China (1955-2011) and
   compare them with Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data
   (1979-2007) and reanalysis data in various latitude zones to study
   changes in precipitation extremes. Significant decreases in light
   precipitation and increases in heavy precipitation are found at both
   rural and urban stations, as well as low latitudes over the ocean, while
   total precipitation shows little change. Characteristics of these
   changes and changes in the equatorial zone and other latitudes suggest
   that global warming rather than aerosol effects is the primary cause of
   the changes. In eastern China, increases of annual total dry days (28
   days) and a parts per thousand yen10 consecutive dry days (36\%) are due
   to the decrease in light precipitation days, thereby establishing a
   causal link among global warming, changes in precipitation extremes, and
   higher meteorological risk of floods and droughts. Further, results
   derived from the GPCP data and reanalysis data suggest that the causal
   link exists over widespread regions of the globe.},

Abstract = {For China, long-term changes are detected not only in the means of eight
   extreme precipitation indices, but also in their distribution shapes by
   quantile regression. This resulted in different trends for the means and
   other aspects of the index distributions. The differences between
   changes in the means and upper/lower extremes vary with region and
   index. A noteworthy feature is that changes in upper tails of the index
   distributions across a broad area, especially in the south, are at a
   much higher rate than mean trends estimated by the traditional linear
   regression model. This has practical implications for disaster risk
   management.},

Abstract = {According to the mean seasonal and annual precipitation from 30
   meteorological stations in the periods of 1961-2008, the precipitation
   trends are analyzed by using the Mann-Kendall (MK) test in the Jinsha
   River basin (JRB). Both the temporal and spatial distribution
   characteristics of precipitation trends in different regions in the JRB
   are studied for the first time in this paper. There is a slight and
   insignificant increasing trend in seasonal and annual precipitation
   except for autumn precipitation, and the annual precipitation has
   increased by 0.7634 mm yr(-1) during the last 48 years. The increasing
   precipitation trends in spring seem more significant than those in the
   other three seasons, and autumn is the only season showing a slight and
   insignificant decreasing precipitation trend. There are more than 80\%
   of stations exhibiting increasing trends for annual precipitation, and
   it goes to 90\% for spring precipitation. The increasing precipitation
   trends in the headwater and the middle reaches are more dominant than
   those in the upper and lower reaches. The largest increase magnitude
   occurred in the less precipitation area, while the largest decrease
   magnitude occurred in the more precipitation area. The increasing trend
   of minimum precipitation series and decreasing trend of maximum
   precipitation series could result in a decreasing trend for the range
   series in the JRB. In general, the increasing trends of precipitation in
   the tributary (the Yalong River) are more significant than those in the
   mainstream (the Jinsha River). The results of this study will provide
   further knowledge for understanding on the climate change in the JRB.},

Title = {Intraseasonal variability of global land monsoon precipitation and its
   recent trend},
Journal = {NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Accurate prediction of global land monsoon rainfall on a sub-seasonal
   (2-8 weeks) time scale has become a worldwide demand. Current forecasts
   of weekly-mean rainfall in most monsoon regions, however, have limited
   skills beyond two weeks, calling for a more profound understanding of
   monsoon intraseasonal variability (ISV). We show that the high-frequency
   (HF; 8-20 days) ISV, crucial for the Week 2 and Week 3 predictions,
   accounts for about 53-70\% of the total (8-70 days) ISV, generally
   dominating the sub-seasonal predictability of various land monsoons,
   while the low-frequency (LF; 20-70 days)'s contribution is comparable to
   HF only over Australia (AU; 47\%), South Asia (SA; 43\%), and South
   America (SAM; 40\%). The leading modes of HFISVs in Northern Hemisphere
   (NH) monsoons primarily originate from different convectively coupled
   equatorial waves, while from mid-latitude wave trains for Southern
   Hemisphere (SH) monsoons and East Asian (EA) monsoon. The Madden-Julian
   Oscillation (MJO) directly regulates LFISVs in Asian-Australian monsoon
   and affects American and African monsoons by exciting Kelvin waves and
   mid-latitude teleconnections. During the past four decades, the HF (LF)
   ISVs have considerably intensified over Asian (Asian-Australian) monsoon
   but weakened over American (SAM) monsoon. Sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S)
   prediction models exhibit higher sub-seasonal prediction skills over AU,
   SA, and SAM monsoons that have larger LFISV contributions than other
   monsoons. These results suggest an urgent need to improve the simulation
   of convectively coupled equatorial waves and two-way interactions
   between regional monsoon ISVs and mid-latitude processes and between MJO
   and regional monsoons, especially under the global warming scenarios.},

   review},

Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {North, Central, and South America (collectively referred to as the
   Americas) extend across two hemispheres, and together cover
   approximately 28\% of Earth's land area and are home to about 13\% of
   the world's population. Unique ecosystems, diversified cultures, and
   communities that inhabit the region rely on precipitation delivered
   yearly by multiple systems, including mid-latitudes storms, the North
   and South American Monsoons, and tropical storms and hurricanes. The
   rapid warming of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans combined with
   internal variability of the climate system, have modified precipitation
   patterns from the tropics to high latitudes. In the Americas,
   instrumental records have shown evidence of upward trends in extreme
   precipitation (amount, intensity, and frequency) in many areas. The most
   consistent evidence of precipitation trends occurs in mid-latitudes of
   North America and in the subtropics of South America. Recent studies
   have indicated a poleward shift of heavy precipitation associated with
   South American Monsoon. Nonetheless, the deficient network of rain
   gauges in vast areas over tropical Americas limits the assessment of
   trends in regions with heavy rainfall amounts. Additionally, observed
   trends in the North America monsoon precipitation are difficult to
   separate from the contribution of tropical storms and hurricanes.
   Furthermore, coupled modes such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
   modulate precipitation in the Americas, from the tropics to the
   extratropics, and these teleconnections are relevant to assess
   precipitation trends using historical records. This review evaluates all
   these complex issues focusing on observations based on instrumental
   datasets. This article is categorized under: Paleoclimates and Current
   Trends > Modern Climate Change},

Title = {Spatial patterns and temporal trends of daily precipitation indices in
   Iran},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {124},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {239-253},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Spatial patterns of daily precipitation indices and their temporal
   trends over Iran are investigated using the APHRODITE gridded daily
   precipitation dataset for the period 1961-2004. The performance and
   limitations of the gridded dataset are checked against observations at
   ten rain-gauge stations that are representative of different climates in
   Iran. Results suggest that the spatial patterns of the indices reflect
   the role of orography and sea neighborhoods in differentiating
   central-southern arid and semi-arid regions from northern and western
   mountainous humid areas. It is also found that western Iran is impacted
   by the most extreme daily precipitation events occurring in the country,
   though the number of rainy days has its maximum in the Caspian Sea
   region. The time series of precipitation indices is checked for
   long-term trends using the least squares method and Mann-Kendall test.
   The maximum daily precipitation per year shows upward trends in most of
   Iran, though being statistically significant only in western regions. In
   the same regions, upward trends are also observed in the number of wet
   days and in the accumulated precipitation and intensity during wet days.
   Conversely, the contribution of precipitation events below the 75th
   percentile to the annual total precipitation is decreasing with time,
   suggesting that extreme events are responsible for the upward trend
   observed in the total annual precipitation and in the other indices.
   This tendency towards more severe/extreme precipitation events, if
   confirmed by other datasets and further analyses with longer records,
   would require the implementation of adequate water resources management
   plans in western Iran aimed at mitigating the increasing risk of intense
   precipitation and associated flash floods and soil erosion.},

Abstract = {The precipitation regime of the low latitude highlands of Yunnan in
   Southwest China is subject to the interactions between the East Asian
   Summer Monsoon and the Indian Summer Monsoon, and the influence of
   surface orography. An understanding of changes in its spatial and
   temporal patterns is urgently needed for climate change projection,
   hydrological impact modelling, and regional and downstream water
   resources management. Using daily precipitation records of the low
   latitude highlands over the last several decades (1950s-2007), a time
   series of precipitation indices, including annual precipitation, number
   of rainy days, mean annual precipitation intensity, the dates of the
   onset of the rainy season, degree and period of precipitation seasonal
   concentration, the highest 1-day, 3-day and 7-day precipitation, and
   precipitation amount and number of rainy days for precipitation above
   different intensities.(such as >= 10 mm, >= 25 mm and >= 50 mm of daily
   precipitation), was constructed. The Trend-Free Pre-Whitening
   Mann-Kendall trend test was then used to detect trends of the time
   series data. The results show that there is no significant trend in
   annual precipitation and strong seasonal differentiation of
   precipitation trends across the low latitude highlands. Springs and
   winters are getting wetter and summers are getting drier. Autumns are
   getting drier in the east and wetter in the west. As a consequence, the
   seasonality of precipitation is weakening slightly. The beginning of the
   rainy season and the period of the highest precipitation tend to be
   earlier. In the meantime, the low latitude highlands has also witnessed
   less rainy days, more intense precipitation, slightly longer. moderate
   and heavy precipitation events, and more frequent extreme precipitation
   events. Additionally, regional differentiation of precipitation trends
   is remarkable. These variations may be associated with weakening of the
   East Asian summer monsoon and strengthening of the South Asian summer
   monsoon, as well as the ``corridor-barrier{''} effects of special
   mountainous terrain. However, the physical mechanisms involved still
   need to be uncovered in the future.},

Title = {Trends in Precipitation Extremes in the Zhujiang River Basin, South
   China},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation trends in the
   Zhujiang River basin, South China, are analyzed. Nonparametric trend
   tests are applied to daily precipitation data from 192 weather stations
   between 1961 and 2007 for the following indices: annual, monthly, and
   daily precipitation; annual and monthly number of rain days and
   precipitation intensity; annual and monthly maximum precipitation; 5-day
   maximum precipitation, number of rainstorms with > 50 mm day(-1), and
   peaks over thresholds (90th, 95th, and 99th percentile).
   The results show that few stations experienced trends in the
   precipitation indices on an annual basis. On a monthly basis,
   significant positive and negative trends above the 90\% confidence level
   appear in all months except December. Trends in the indices of monthly
   precipitation, rain intensity, rain days, and monthly maximum
   precipitation show very similar characteristics. They experience the
   most distinct negative (positive) trends in October (January). A change
   of the mean wind direction by 50 degrees from east-southeast to
   east-northeast explains the downward trend in precipitation in October.
   Dry October months (months with low precipitation indices) can be
   observed when the mean wind direction is east-northeast (arid) instead
   of the prevailing mean wind direction, east-southeast (moist). The
   former is typical for the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). Nearly 90\%
   of the driest October months can be explained by wind directions typical
   for the EAWM. The upward trend in precipitation indices in January
   cannot be explained by changes in large-scale circulation. The analysis
   of the precipitation indices delivers more detailed information on
   observed changes than other studies in the same area. This can be
   attributed to the higher station density, the quality of daily data, and
   the focus on monthly trends in the current study.},

Title = {Secular trends in indices of precipitation extremes in Croatia,

Abstract = {In this study, trends in annual and seasonal precipitation amounts in
   Croatia are discussed. This discussion is followed by trend analysis in
   seven indices of precipitation extremes, which indicate intensity and
   frequency of extreme rainfall events. These indices have been proposed
   by World Meteorological Organisation and are calculated using daily
   precipitation amounts. The data sets used in this study cover the period
   1901-2008 at five meteorological stations distributed among different
   climate conditions in Croatia: continental, mountainous and maritime.
   The trends are estimated by a simple least squares fit of the linear
   model and tested for statistical significance by a non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test. The time series with significant trends are
   identified, and a Sneyers progressive analysis is then performed to
   determine the beginning of the trend. The time series analysis of
   coefficients of variation in consecutive 30-year periods indicates the
   variability in precipitation. The extreme quantiles for annual one-day
   and five-day precipitation maxima have been estimated by the Generalised
   Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and discussed in relation to the
   original time-series. The results show a downward trend in annual
   precipitation amounts since the beginning of the 20th century throughout
   Croatia, which agrees with the drying trend observed across the
   Mediterranean. Precipitation amounts have large interannual variability,
   on both annual and seasonal scales. By the end of the 20th century, the
   precipitation variability decreased in the north-western Croatian
   mountainous and northern littoral regions and the eastern lowlands. The
   Dalmatian islands experienced increased variability since the middle of
   the 20th century. In regions of drying, such as Croatia, there is no
   evidence of major secular changes in precipitation extremes that are
   related to the high amounts of precipitation and the frequency of heavy
   rainfall days over the majority of Croatia.},

Title = {Interpreting the Trends of Extreme Precipitation in Florida through
   Pressure Change},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Precipitation is one of the many important natural factors impacting
   agriculture and natural resource management. Although statistics have
   been applied to investigate the non-stationary trend and the
   unpredictable variances of precipitation under climate change, existing
   methods usually lack a sound physical basis that can be generally
   applied in any location and at any time for future extrapolation,
   especially in tropical areas. Physically, the formation of precipitation
   is a result of ascending air which reduces air pressure and condenses
   moisture into drops, either by irregular terrain or atmospheric
   phenomena (e.g., via frontal lifting). Thus, in this paper, pressure
   change events (PCEs) will be used as a physical indicator of the
   stability of atmospheric systems to reveal the impact of temperature on
   precipitation in the tropical areas of Florida. By using data from both
   national and regional weather observation networks, this study segments
   the continuous observation series into PCE sequences for further
   analysis divided by dry and wet seasons. The results reveal that the
   frequency and intensity of PCE are highly associated with the
   occurrences of weather events. Decreasing pressure favors precipitation,
   and may turn extreme when the temperature and air moisture are
   sufficient to fuel the process. With similar intensity, decreasing
   pressure change events (DePCEs) generally bear a higher probability of
   precipitation (POP) and precipitation depth (PD) than increasing
   pressure change events (InPCEs). The frequency of alternating between
   InPCEs and DePCEs is subject to the temperature of the season and
   climate. Due to the seasonal fluctuations of weather characteristics,
   such as temperature and relative humidity, the dependence of extreme
   precipitation on these characteristics can be interpreted via PCE. A 7\%
   increase rate of precipitation vs. temperature rise, determined by the
   Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relationship, can be observed from extreme
   precipitation with variances in the season and PCE types. Although
   indicated by other research, active vertical movement of air caused by a
   phase change in water at the frozen point is not pronounced in Florida.
   The response patterns of humidity to precipitation also vary by season
   and PCE types in extreme conditions. In summary, PCEs demonstrate
   reliable physical evidence of precipitation formation and can better
   associate the occurrence and intensity of extreme weather with other
   characteristics. In turn, such associations embody the underlying
   physical concepts present at any location in the world.},

Title = {Regional and Seasonal Precipitation and Drought Trends in
   Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Satellite-based precipitation products can be a better alternative of
   rain gauges for hydro-meteorological studies in data-poor regions. This
   study aimed to evaluate how regional and seasonal precipitation and
   drought patterns had changed in the Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin between 1983
   and 2020 with PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data. The spatial pattern of
   winter drought, monsoon drought, and Standardized Precipitation Index
   (SPI) calculated for different time scales were evaluated using
   principal component analysis. Ganga-Brahmaputra is one of the most
   populated river basins that flows through different geographical
   regions. Rain gauges are heterogeneously distributed in the basin due to
   its complex orography, highlighting the significance of gridded
   precipitation products over gauge observations for climate studies.
   Annual and monthly precipitation trends between 1983 and 2020 were
   evaluated using the original and modified Mann-Kendall trend test, and
   annual precipitation in the basin was found to be declining at a rate of
   5.8 mm/year. An increasing trend was observed in pre-monsoon rainfall,
   whereas precipitation exhibited a decreasing trend for other months.
   Results of the Pettitt test showed precipitation time series was
   inhomogeneous and changepoint occurred around 2000. Decreasing trends of
   SPI indicated increasing frequency and intensity of drought events.
   Winter drought showed a clear spatial pattern in the basin; however,
   SPIs calculated for different time scales and monsoon drought had
   complex spatial patterns. This study demonstrates the applicability of
   satellite-based PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data in climate research in
   the Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin.},

Abstract = {Analyzing trends in precipitation data is crucial for understanding the
   effects of climate change and making informed decisions about water
   management and crop patterns. The objective of the presented study was
   to investigate precipitation trends, analyze temporal and spatial
   variations and identify potential change points in Turkey throughout the
   period from 1980 to 2019. Precipitation data were analyzed for both
   regional and 81 meteorological stations in Turkey on a monthly,
   seasonal, and annual basis. Spearman rank correlation and Mann-Kendall
   tests were utilized to detect possible trends and Sen's slope test to
   estimate the magnitude of change throughout the entire time series. The
   average precipitation amount of Turkey was determined 639.2 mm between
   the years 1980 and 2019. While Central Anatolian and Eastern Anatolian
   regions had below 639.2 mm, other regions were above. The range of
   seasonal precipitation values were found for winter 128.7-320.8 mm,
   108.9-260.0 mm for spring, 43.9-109.3 mm for summer, and 79.7-238.4 mm
   for autumn. The analysis of the data revealed no significant increase or
   decrease in annual values on a regional basis, with the greatest change
   on a seasonal basis being observed in the winter. The 40-year trends of
   annual precipitation data belonging to 81 stations were decreasing in 23
   provinces and increasing in 58 provinces, and 11 of them (14\% of the
   total) were found to be statistically significant. Moreover, November
   was found to be a month of particular significance in terms of
   precipitation changes across the country, with a decrease observed in 80
   out of 81 provinces. Spatial distribution analysis showed that the
   magnitude of variation in precipitation decreased as one moved from the
   southern to the northern regions of the country.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN WATER},

Abstract = {Trends in extreme precipitation and their causes were analyzed for
   events within the Laurentian Great Lakes for several periods: 1908-2020,
   1949-2020, 1980-2019, and 1980-2020. Upward trends in extreme
   precipitation were found for multiple metrics, including the number of
   exceedances of return period thresholds for several durations and
   average recurrence intervals (ARI), the number of extreme basin-average
   4-day precipitation totals, and the annual maximum daily station
   precipitation. The causes of extreme events were classified into 5
   meteorological categories: fronts of extratropical cyclones (ETC-FRT),
   extratropical cyclones but not proximate to the fronts (ETC-NFRT),
   mesoscale convective systems (MCS), tropical cyclones (TC), and air mass
   convection (AMC). For daily events exceeding the threshold for 5-yr ARI,
   ETC-FRTs account for 78\% of all events, followed by ETC-NFRTs (12\%),
   MCSs (6\%), TCs (2\%), and AMC (1\%). Upward trends in the number of
   events by cause were found for all categories except AMC. An examination
   of basin-wide 4-day extreme events (40 largest events during 1980-2019)
   found that all events were caused by ETC-FRTs (85\%) or ETC-NFRTs
   (15\%).},

Abstract = {Drought is a complex natural hazard with slow-onset and can occur over
   months or even years. Typically, a drought index is used to quantify the
   effect of drought which is based on various meteorological parameters,
   most importantly precipitation. However, the changing pattern of the
   rainfall is now a concerning issue and therefore, trend analysis of the
   precipitation data has become a vital part of the study, as it gives
   important information of the possibility of changes before prediction
   and analysis of natural hazards like drought. In the present study,
   spatial and temporal assessment of meteorological drought has been
   carried out for the Beed district of the Marathwada region, which is
   known as a drought-prone area in Maharashtra state. Initially, trend
   analysis of 34 years of precipitation data has been carried out using
   non-parametric tests Man-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator. The
   beginning and end of the trend is determined using sequential
   Mann-Kendall test. Then, standardized precipitation index (SPI) values
   of different timescales (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12-monthly) were used to
   identify and analyze the drought events. The evaluation of the spatial
   distribution of the SPI over the region has been carried out using GIS.
   The results of trend analysis revealed that the East and West Beed
   region station shows non-significant decreasing trends while Central
   Beed shows a non-significant increasing trend for the monsoon season
   (June to September). The study has identified a total of six drought
   events (1985-86, 1987-88, 1992-93, 2001- 02, 2005-06, and 2011-12) from
   1979 to 2013. The results of the study show that Jamkhed, Ashti,
   Majalgaon, and Ambejogai are the most affected areas, whereas, Georai
   and Beed are the least affected during the drought events. The findings
   of present study will be helpful to gain a better understanding of the
   drought situation through in-depth trend analysis of precipitation, and
   assisting policymakers in developing a drought management plan to
   address the water related crisis. Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Various hydrological and meteorological variables such as rainfall and
   temperature have been affected by global climate change. Any change in
   the pattern of precipitation can have a significant impact on the
   availability of water resources, agriculture, and the ecosystem.
   Therefore, knowledge on rainfall trend is an important aspect of water
   resources management. In this study, the regional annual and seasonal
   precipitation trends at the Langat River Basin, Malaysia, for the period
   of 1982-2011 were examined at the 95 \% level of significance using the
   regional average Mann-Kendall (RAMK) test and the regional average
   Mann-Kendall coupled with bootstrap (RAMK-bootstrap) method. In order to
   identify the homogeneous regions respectively for the annual and
   seasonal scales, firstly, at-site mean total annual and separately
   at-site mean total seasonal precipitation were spatialized into 5 km x 5
   km grids using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) algorithm. Next, the
   optimum number of homogeneous regions (clusters) is computed using the
   silhouette coefficient approach. Next, the homogeneous regions were
   formed using the K-mean clustering method. From the annual scale
   perspective, all three regions showed positive trends. However, the
   application of two methods at this scale showed a significant trend only
   in the region AC1. The region AC2 experienced a significant positive
   trend using only the RAMK test. On a seasonal scale, all regions showed
   insignificant trends, except the regions I1C1 and I1C2 in the
   Inter-Monsoon 1 (INT1) season which experienced significant upward
   trends. In addition, it was proven that the significance of trends has
   been affected by the existence of serial and spatial correlations.},

Abstract = {A multiple regression model is introduced to describe temporal
   variations in precipitation chemistry data. The model considers the
   effects of the annual cycle, a linear trend and precipitation-quantity
   simultaneously. The paper discusses the application of the model to
   concentrations and depositions of hydronium, ammonium, nitrate and
   sulfate for monthly bulk samples in the Netherlands for the period
   1978-1984. Statistical conclusions about the annual cycle and the trend
   are hardly influenced by the choice of the dependent variable
   (depositions, concentrations or logarithms of concentrations). With the
   exception of H+ concentrations, a large part of the temporal variations
   was due to precipitation-quantity effects. Significant annual cycles
   were found for nitrate, ammonium and sulfate. There was statistical
   evidence of a downward trend for sulfate and nitrate. A complex,
   non-linear trend was observed for H+ which resulted in a significant
   autocorrelation of the residuals from the regression equation. Much
   attention is paid to the detectability of trend. For ammonium, nitrate
   and sulfate it is possible to discriminate small sytemic changes in
   quite short records (a mean annual change of 4-6\% in a 5-year record).
   This is not the case for H+, becaue temporal variations of this
   component are insufficiently explained by the systematic annual cycle
   and precipitation-quantity.},

   Initially, in order to obtain a rainfall overview, the dominant trend of
   the period 1921-2017 was evaluated. In addition, to obtain a comparable
   analysis, the average precipitations grouped in climatological standard
   normals were analyzed. Finally, the main purpose of the research was
   achieved by analyzing extreme events in the middle Adriatic side. In
   addition, forecasts of extreme precipitation events, with a return
   period of 100 years, were made using the theory of ``generalized extreme
   value{''} (GEV). The innovation of this research is represented by the
   use of geostatistics to spatialize the variables investigated, through a
   clear and immediate graphic representation performed through GIS
   software. This study is a necessary starting point for the study of
   climate dynamics in the region, and it is also a useful tool for land

Title = {Intra-Event Trends in Stable Isotopes: Exploring Midlatitude
   Precipitation Using a Vertically Pointing Micro Rain Radar},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Annual, monthly, and daily analyses of stable isotopes in precipitation
   are commonly made worldwide, yet only a few studies have explored the
   variations occurring on short time scales within individual
   precipitation events, particularly at midlatitude locations. This study
   examines hydrogen isotope data from sequential, intra-event samples from
   16 precipitation events during different seasons and a range of synoptic
   conditions over an 18-month period in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
   Precipitation events were observed simultaneously using a vertically
   pointing micro rain radar (MRR), which, for the first time at a
   midlatitude location, allowed high-resolution examination of the
   microphysical characteristics (e.g., rain rate, fall velocity, and drop
   size distributions) that may influence the local isotopic composition of
   rainwater. The range in the hydrogen isotope ratio (delta D, where D
   refers to deuterium) in 242 samples during 16 events was from -87.0
   parts per thousand to +9.2 parts per thousand, while the largest
   variation observed in a single event was 55.4 parts per thousand. In
   contrast to previous work, the results indicate that some midlatitude
   precipitation events do indeed show significant intra-event trends that
   are strongly influenced by precipitation processes and parameters such
   as rain rate, melting-level height, and droplet sizes. Inverse
   relationships between rain rate and isotopic composition are observed,
   representing an example of a local type of ``amount effect,{''} a still
   poorly understood process occurring at different scales. For these
   particular events, the mean delta value may therefore not provide all
   the relevant information. This work has significance for the testing and
   development of isotope-enabled cloud-resolving models and land surface
   models at higher resolutions, and it provides improved insights into a
   range of environmental processes that are influenced by subsampled
   precipitation events.},

Abstract = {The rainfall regime of the South of Portugal is Mediterranean with
   Atlantic influence. Long-term series of reliable precipitation records
   are essential for land and water resources management, climate-change
   monitoring, modelling of erosion and run-off, among other applications
   for ecosystem and hydrological impact modelling. This study provides a
   qualitative classification of 106 daily rainfall series from stations
   located in the South of Portugal and evaluates temporal patterns in
   extreme precipitation by calculating a number of indicators at stations
   with homogeneous data within the 1955/1999 period. The methodology
   includes both absolute and relative approaches and a new homogeneity
   testing procedure, besides the application of other statistical tests.
   The proposed technique is an extension of the Ellipse test that takes
   into account the contemporaneous relationship between several candidate
   series from the same climatic area (SUR+Ellipse test). The results
   indicate that this technique is a valuable tool for the detection of
   non-climatic irregularities in climate time series if the station
   network is dense enough. The existence of trends and other temporal
   patterns in extreme precipitation indices was investigated and
   uncertainty about rainfall patterns evolution was assessed. Three
   indices describing wet events and another three indicators
   characterizing dry conditions were analysed through regression models
   and smoothing techniques. The simple aridity intensity index (All)
   reflects increases in the magnitude of dryness. Especially pronounced
   trends are found over most of southern Portugal in the 1955/1999 period,
   highlighting the fact that large areas are threatened by drought and
   desertification. The trend signals of the wetness indices are not
   significant at the majority of stations, but there is evidence of
   increasing short-term precipitation intensity over the region during the
   last three decades of the twentieth century. Finally, the results also
   indicate that extreme precipitation variability and climate uncertainty
   are greater in recent times. Copyright (C) 2008 Royal Meteorological

Abstract = {This article summarizes the results from an analysis conducted to
   investigate the spatio-temporal variability and trends in the rainfall
   over Ethiopia over a period of 31years from 1980 to 2010. The data is
   mostly observed station data supplemented by bias-corrected AgMERRA
   climate data. Changes in annual and Belg (March-May) and Kiremt (June to
   September) season rainfalls and rainy days have been analysed over the
   entire Ethiopia. Rainfall is characterized by high temporal variability
   with coefficient of variation (CV, \%) varying from 9 to 30\% in the
   annual, 9 to 69\% during the Kiremt season and 15-55\% during the Belg
   season rainfall amounts. Rainfall variability increased
   disproportionately as the amount of rainfall declined from 700 to 100mm
   or less. No significant trend was observed in the annual rainfall
   amounts over the country, but increasing and decreasing trends were
   observed in the seasonal rainfall amounts in some areas. A declining
   trend is also observed in the number of rainy days especially in Oromia,
   Benishangul-Gumuz and Gambella regions. Trends in seasonal rainfall
   indicated a general decline in the Belg season and an increase in the
   Kiremt season rainfall amounts. The increase in rainfall during the main
   Kiremt season along with the decrease in the number of rainy days leads
   to an increase in extreme rainfall events over Ethiopia. The trends in
   the 95th-percentile rainfall events illustrate that the annual extreme
   rainfall events are increasing over the eastern and south-western parts
   of Ethiopia covering Oromia and Benishangul-Gumuz regions. During the
   Belg season, extreme rainfall events are mostly observed over central
   Ethiopia extending towards the southern part of the country while during
   the Kiremt season, they are observed over parts of Oromia, (covering
   Borena, Guji, Bali, west Harerge and east Harerge), Somali, Gambella,
   southern Tigray and Afar regions. Changes in the intensity of extreme
   rainfall events are mostly observed over south-eastern parts of Ethiopia
   extending to the south-west covering Somali and Oromia regions. Similar
   trends are also observed in the greatest 3-, 5- and 10-day rainfall
   amounts. Changes in the consecutive dry and wet days showed that
   consecutive wet days during Belg and Kiremt seasons decreased
   significantly in many areas in Ethiopia while consecutive dry days
   increased. The consistency in the trends over large spatial areas
   confirms the robustness of the trends and serves as a basis for
   understanding the projected changes in the climate. These results were
   discussed in relation to their significance to agriculture.},

Abstract = {Monthly mean satellite data from the Global Precipitation Climatology
   Project (GPCPv2) are used to examine the year-by-year variability of
   precipitation over the Mediterranean Basin and its changes over the
   period 1979-2010. The results show that the mean annual precipitation
   averaged over the study area has slightly increased from 1979 to 2010 by
   1.28 mm or by 0.2\% (trend not statistically significant at the 95\%
   confidence level). Nevertheless, examining the trends at a local scale,
   spatial and temporal patterns are revealed, with opposite trends in
   adjacent areas and increasing precipitation in summer and autumn against
   almost unchanged or decreasing precipitation in winter and spring,
   respectively. Inter-decadal changes of precipitation are detected, with
   precipitation decreasing in the 1980s, then increasing through the late
   1990s and finally declining in the 2000s before levelling off since
   2007. These changes are significantly anti-correlated (R=-0.57, up to
   -0.66 in winter) with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, thus
   confirming the critical role of this large-scale teleconnection for the
   regional precipitation over the basin.},

Abstract = {Temperature data 1900-2010 from meteorological stations across the world
   have been analyzed and it has been found that all land areas generally
   have two different valid temperature trends. Coastal stations and hill
   stations facing ocean winds are normally more warm-trended than the
   valley stations that are sheltered from dominant oceans winds.
   Thus, we found that in any area with variation in the topography, we can
   divide the stations into the more warm trended ocean air-affected
   stations, and the more cold-trended ocean air-sheltered stations. We
   find that the distinction between ocean air-affected and ocean
   air-sheltered stations can be used to identify the influence of the
   oceans on land surface. We can then use this knowledge as a tool to
   better study climate variability on the land surface without the
   moderating effects of the ocean.
   We find a lack of warming in the ocean air sheltered temperature data -
   with less impact of ocean temperature trends - after 1950. The lack of
   warming in the ocean air sheltered temperature trends after 1950 should
   be considered when evaluating the climatic effects of changes in the
   Earth's atmospheric trace amounts of greenhouse gasses as well as
   variations in solar conditions.},

Volume = {12},

Abstract = {In eastern Africa droughts can cause crop failure and lead to food
   insecurity. With increasing temperatures, there is an a priori
   assumption that droughts are becoming more severe. However, the link
   between droughts and climate change is not sufficiently understood. Here
   we investigate trends in long-term agricultural drought and the
   influence of increasing temperatures and precipitation deficits.
   Using a combination of models and observational datasets, we studied
   trends, spanning the period from 1900 (to approximate pre-industrial
   conditions) to 2018, for six regions in eastern Africa in four
   drought-related annually averaged variables: soil moisture,
   precipitation, temperature, and evaporative demand (E-0). In
   standardized soil moisture data, we found no discernible trends. The
   strongest influence on soil moisture variability was from precipitation,
   especially in the drier or water-limited study regions; temperature and
   E-0 did not demonstrate strong relations to soil moisture. However, the
   error margins on precipitation trend estimates are large and no clear
   trend is evident, whereas significant positive trends were observed in
   local temperatures. The trends in E-0 are predominantly positive, but we
   do not find strong relations between E-0 and soil moisture trends.
   Nevertheless, the E-0 trend results can still be of interest for
   irrigation purposes because it is E-0 that determines the maximum
   evaporation rate.
   We conclude that until now the impact of increasing local temperatures
   on agricultural drought in eastern Africa is limited and we recommend
   that any soil moisture analysis be supplemented by an analysis of
   precipitation deficit.},

Abstract = {This work investigates recent changes in precipitation patterns

   stations scattered over mainland Portugal and the Portuguese North
   Atlantic Islands of Madeira and Azores; some of the time series date
   back to the 19th century. The data were tested for trends using the
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and Sen's non-parametric method,
   searching both for full monotonic trends over the record period and for
   partial trends. Results provide no evidence for rejecting the null
   hypothesis of no trend in annual precipitation, when a monotonic linear
   model was used. Nevertheless, the analyses of 50 years' moving averages
   showed an increase over time, in the recent past, for many of the series
   in mainland Portugal and the Islands. For the longest time series this
   behaviour was preceded by a decrease over time. The analyses of partial
   trends in the time series suggested a sequence of alternately decreasing
   and increasing trends in annual and monthly precipitation, which are
   sometimes statistically significant. The trend changing points were
   identified.},

Abstract = {Investigation of the role of the east Atlantic-west Russia (EA-WR)
   teleconnection pattern in determining the variability of the monthly
   mean Mediterranean area precipitation is performed. Space correlations
   between the mean monthly precipitation and the EA-WR index during
   1950-2000 have been calculated. The EA-WR/precipitation correlations are
   statistically significant over the eastern Atlantic and southeastern
   Mediterranean regions. Two pairs of 10-year periods characterized by low
   and high EA-WR regimes have been selected. The EA-WR/precipitation
   correlation patterns have been calculated for each of the periods.
   Common features that characterize the periods with the two EA-WR regimes
   are determined. One of the zones with the notable differences between
   the correlation patterns is found located over the eastern Mediterranean
   (EM) region. To determine the mechanisms responsible for the differences
   we analyse the low and high EA-WR low-troposphere circulations
   characterizing periods with EM precipitation (CEMP). The differences in
   the correlation patterns are explained by variations in the air mass
   transport to the EM area during the wet December-February (DJF) months
   during the two EA-WR regimes. Namely, during the low EA-WR years the
   CEMP is characterized by mean atmospheric flow transporting the air
   masses from the Atlantic to the EM. On the contrary, for high EA-WR DJF
   months the CEMP is typically characterized by advection to the EM of the
   air masses from central Europe. This finding allows explanation of the
   observed precipitation decline over the EM during the last several
   decades of the past century in terms of the positive trend of the EA-WR.

Volume = {62},

Abstract = {Variations and changes in the tropical (30oN-30oS) precipitation amount
   and precipitation intensity during the satellite era (1979-present) are
   investigated by means of the satellite-based monthly precipitation
   product from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) version
   2.3. Precipitation spatial intensity distributions represented by
   monthly percentiles and the differences between high/low percentiles and
   mean precipitation are examined for the tropical domain and for seven
   tropical sectors with distinct climate characteristics. Variations and
   trends in these components are closely related to the changes in
   precipitation regimes including shifting, shrinking/enlarging of
   tropical and regional wet/dry zones and also to the changes in
   precipitation intensity. Increases in high percentiles and decreases in
   low percentiles appear over tropical land and ocean, despite intense
   interannual variability contributed primarily by the El Ni \&
   ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Positive (negative) trends in the
   differences between wet (dry) percentiles and mean precipitation can be
   seen over tropical land and ocean as well, suggesting the broadening of
   precipitation spatial intensity distribution. Regional results generally
   support this conclusion except over tropical Africa and South Asia.
   These observational results are also generally evident in CMIP6
   historical and AMIP6 runs with regards to the signs of the changes,
   though with smaller magnitudes. Relative to tropical (land + ocean) mean
   precipitation, wet percentile trends are + 0.7, + 0.8 and + 2.5\%/decade
   and dry percentile trends are - 0.6, -0.7 and - 1.8\%/decade for CMIP6,
   AMIP6 and GPCP, respectively. The zonal-mean ITCZ intensity defined by
   GPCP, CMIP6 and AMIP6 precipitation increased during the period at a
   similar change rate to respective mean precipitation over tropical wet
   grid-cells, both stronger than the changes in tropical mean
   precipitation. These consistencies further corroborate the strengthening
   contrast between wet and dry in the tropics.},

Abstract = {In this study, variations of the chemical composition of precipitation
   in Nanjing, China, over a 12-year period (1992-2003) are presented. The
   average annual concentration of pH value was 5.15, from 4.93 to 5.36,
   and there was no significant trend in the acidity of precipitation.
   SO42-, Cl- and NO3- were the main anions, while Ca2+, NH4+ and Mg2+ were
   the main cations. The concentrations of these main ions were very high
   compared to those reported in many other areas around the world. Most of
   the ions came from anthropogenic and crustal sources. High correlations
   were found among dust-derived cations Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+, between Cl- and
   SO42-, between Cl- and NH4+ and between acidic anions and dust-derived
   cations, such as SO42- and Ca2+, SO42- and K+, Cl- and Ca2+, Cl- and K+,
   F- and Mg2+ and F- and K+. A significant decreasing trend was observed
   in concentration SO42- because of the abatement strategies for SO2
   emissions and energy policy change, while a significant increasing trend
   was found in the contribution of NO3- to acidification due to the
   rapidly growing number of motor vehicles. A significant decreasing trend
   was found in dust-derived cation Ca2+ due to more stringent controls of
   industrial dust emissions and rapid urbanization reducing the amount of
   open land, while the contribution of NH4+ to neutralization increased
   relatively. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {35},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {East Africa is so vulnerable to the impacts of precipitation extremes
   varying from frequent floods to prolonged droughts. However, systematic
   regional assessment of precipitation extremes across seasons has
   received little attention, and most previous studies of precipitation
   extremes have employed many indices and sparse gauge observations giving
   marginalized details. In this study, we use three precipitation extreme
   indices to examine the intensity of the highest single-day rainfall
   record (rx1day), prevalence of very heavy rainfalls (r30mm), and
   persistence of successive wet days (cwd) at both annual and seasonal
   scales over recent two decades (1998-2018) based on the Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis
   data. The results show that the most intensive and frequent
   precipitation extremes are noticeable from January to May across the
   areas extending from Madagascar to the Tanzanian coastal zone. These
   areas also exhibit patches of significant increasing trends in
   frequency, duration, and intensity of precipitation extremes annually
   and seasonally. However, significant declines in frequency and intensity
   of precipitation extremes are observed from western Ethiopia to
   Congo-Uganda, especially in June-September. The October-December season
   witnesses higher interannual variability amounting to overall weak and
   less significant trends. Further subregional assessment shows overall
   declining intensity and frequency of precipitation extremes in northern
   part of the study areas. Mean wetness duration increased, with
   persistence of moderate wet days and slight reduction of severe events.
   This study unveils higher susceptibility of the East African region to
   the widely observed hotspots of precipitation extremes posing threats to
   food security, water resource, and human well-being. The region should
   consider upscaling irrigation schemes in addition to planning resilient
   and supportive infrastructures to withstand the upsurging precipitation
   extremes, especially along the coastal zone.},

Abstract = {Global precipitation variations over the satellite era are reviewed
   using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly,
   globally complete analyses, which integrate satellite and surface gauge
   information. Mean planetary values are examined and compared, over
   ocean, with information from recent satellite programs and related
   estimates, with generally positive agreements, but with some indication
   of small underestimates for GPCP over the global ocean. Variations
   during the satellite era in global precipitation are tied to ENSO
   events, with small increases during El Ninos, and very noticeable
   decreases after major volcanic eruptions. No overall significant trend
   is noted in the global precipitation mean value, unlike that for surface
   temperature and atmospheric water vapor. However, there is a pattern of
   positive and negative trends across the planet with increases over
   tropical oceans and decreases over some middle latitude regions. These
   observed patterns are a result of a combination of inter-decadal
   variations and the effect of the global warming during the period. The
   results reviewed here indicate the value of such analyses as GPCP and
   the possible improvement in the information as the record lengthens and
   as new, more sophisticated and more accurate observations are included.},

Title = {Precipitation Intensity Trend Detection using Hourly and Daily
   Observations in Portland, Oregon},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The intensity of precipitation is expected to increase in response to
   climate change, but the regions where this may occur are unclear. The
   lack of certainty from climate models warrants an examination of trends
   in observational records. However, the temporal resolution of records
   may affect the success of trend detection. Daily observations are often
   used, but may be too coarse to detect changes. Sub-daily records may
   improve detection, but their value is not yet quantified. Using daily
   and hourly records from 24 rain gages in Portland, Oregon (OR), trends
   in precipitation intensity and volume are examined for the period of
   1999-2015. Daily intensity is measured using the Simple Daily Intensity
   Index, and this method is adapted to measure hourly scale intensity.
   Kendall's tau, a non-parametric correlation coefficient, is used for
   monotonic trend detection. Field significance and tests for spatial
   autocorrelation using Moran's Index are used to determine the
   significance of group hypothesis tests. Results indicate that the hourly
   data is superior in trend detection when compared with daily data; more
   trends are detected with hourly scale data at both the 5\% and 10\%
   significance levels. Hourly records showed a significant increase in 6
   of 12 months, while daily records showed a significant increase in 4 of
   12 months at the 10\% significance level. At both scales increasing

Abstract = {In order to analyse the long-term trend of precipitation in the Asian
   Pacific FRIEND region, records from 30 river basins to represent the
   large range of climatic and hydrological characteristics in the study
   area are selected. The long-term trend in precipitation time series and
   its association with the southern oscillation index (SOI) series are
   investigated. Application of the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test for 30
   precipitation time series has shown that only four of these 30 time
   series have a long-term trend at the 5\% level of significance.
   Nevertheless, most of the records tend to decrease over the last several
   decades. The dataset is further divided geographically into northern,
   middle, and southern zones, with 20 degrees N and 20 degrees S latitude
   as the dividing lines. The middle zone has the greatest variation and
   the southern zone the least variation over the past century. Also, the
   southern zone has greater variation during the past 30 years. The
   association between precipitation and SOI is investigated by dividing
   the precipitation records of each station into El Nino, La Nina, and
   neutral periods. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that differences in
   precipitation for the three classes were most marked in the southern
   zone of the study area. The frequencies of below- and above-average
   precipitation for El Nino, La Nina, and neutral periods are estimated
   for the 30 precipitation time series as well. The results show that the
   frequencies of precipitation under each set of conditions, with lower
   precipitation generally associated with El Nino periods in the southern
   zone. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Volume = {23},

Pages = {63-78},

Abstract = {The influence of the large-scale atmospheric circulation at several
   tropospheric levels on wet season precipitation over 292 sites across
   the Mediterranean area is assessed. A statistical downscaling model is
   designed with an objective methodology based on empirical orthogonal
   functions and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and tested by means
   of cross-validation. In all 30\% of the total Mediterranean October to
   March precipitation variability can be accounted for by the combination
   of four large-scale geopotential height fields and sea level pressure.
   The Mediterranean sea surface temperatures seem to be less relevant to
   explain precipitation variability at interannual time scale. It is shown
   that interdecadal changes in the first CCA mode are related to
   variations in the North Atlantic Oscillation index and responsible for
   comparable time scale variations of the Mediterranean precipitation
   throughout the twentieth century. The analysis reveals that since the
   mid-nineteenth century precipitation steadily increased with a maximum
   in the 1960s and decreased since then. The second half of the twentieth
   century shows a general downward trend of 2.2 mm.month(-1).decade(-1).},

Abstract = {In the context of global warming, it is a well-known fact that there is
   an increase in precipitation in middle latitudes. Convective phenomena
   have also been on the increase in the past few decades. It is gradually
   becoming more difficult to characterize climatic trends in middle
   latitudes. Data show that there may be different results depending on
   the study zones. Thus, it is interesting to study climatic changes in
   recent precipitation series, especially if we can have at our disposal a
   dense network of rainfall stations with reliable precipitation series.
   The analysis of precipitation series in 333 rainfall stations from 1961
   to 1990 has revealed that summer precipitation shows a statistically
   significant trend in wide areas of Mainland Spain. In the months of July
   and August, the precipitation is exclusively convective. In those
   months, the precipitation increased in 20\% of the southern areas, that
   is, in those areas where temperatures are on average higher. June and
   September present different trends showing a decrease in precipitation
   in 10\% of the territory. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) do not always exhibit
   processable physical properties, which makes their processing in an
   industrial setup very demanding. These issues often lead to poor
   robustness and higher cost of the drug product. The issue can be
   mitigated by co-processing the APIs using suitable solvent mediabased
   techniques to streamline pharmaceutical manufacturing operations. Some
   of the co-processing methods are the amalgamation of API purification
   and granulation steps. These techniques also exhibit adequate robustness
   for successful adoption by the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture
   high quality drug products. Spherical crystallization and
   co-precipitation are solvent media-based co-processing approaches that
   enhances the micromeritic and dissolution characteristics of problematic
   APIs. These methods not only improve API characteristics but also enable
   direct compression into tablets. These methods are economical and
   time-saving as they have the potential for effectively circumventing the
   granulation step, which can be a major source of variability in the
   product. This review highlights the recent advancements pertaining to
   these techniques to aid researchers in adopting the right co-processing
   method. Similarly, the possibility of scaling up the production of
   co-processed APIs by these techniques is discussed. The continuous
   manufacturability by co-processing is outlined with a short note on
   Process Analytical Technology (PAT) applicability in monitoring and
   improving the process. \& COPY; 2023 American Pharmacists Association.

Abstract = {In this study, minimum (i.e., outlier or extreme) total monthly rainfall
   data recorded in the East Anatolia region (EAR) in Turkey were examined.
   Trend cases of thirteen stations in the EAR were analyzed using the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) trend and Sen trend tests. The homogeneity test and
   autocorrelation functions of the data of the stations were considered to
   comment. The analyses in this study were based on approximately 60-year
   (1960-2019, except for 17203 (1961-2019), 17285 (1961-2019), and 17204
   (1964-2019)) records at thirteen meteorological stations. Drought cases
   in the previous studies for the EAR were also compared with the trend
   results of this study. The findings showed that there was no
   statistically significant trend for twelve stations except for the 17285
   according to the MK trend test. Although seven stations (17046, 17201,
   17100, 17097, 17199, 17204, and 17165) had a statistically significant
   upward trend, four stations (17203, 17094, 17285, and 17172) had a
   statistically significant downward trend according to the Sen trend
   test. Two stations (17099 and 17096) had no statistically significant
   trend. In the light of these findings, the statistically significant
   trends in minimum total monthly rainfall reported above should be
   considered in water resources management, engineering structures,
   biological/chemical processes, atmospheric conditions, and
   social-economic issues.},

Title = {Innovative Trend Analysis of Precipitation in the Lake Issyk-Kul Basin,
   Kyrgyzstan},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The analysis of various characteristics and trends of precipitation is
   an essential task to improve the utilization of water resources. Lake
   Issyk-Kul basin is an upper alpine catchment, which is more susceptible
   to the effects of climate variability, and identifying rainfall
   variations has vital importance for water resource planning and
   management in the lake basin. The well-known approaches linear
   regression, Sen's slope, Spearman's rho, and Mann-Kendall trend tests
   are applied frequently to try to identify trend variations, especially
   in rainfall, in most literature around the world. Recently, a newly
   developed method of Sen-innovative trend analysis (ITA) provides some
   advantages of visual-graphical illustrations and the identification of
   trends, which is one of the main focuses in this article. This study
   obtained the monthly precipitation data (between 1951 and 2012) from
   three meteorological stations (Balykchy, Cholpon-Ata, and Kyzyl-Suu)
   surrounding the Lake Issyk-Kul, and investigated the trends of
   precipitation variability by applying the ITA method. For comparison
   purposes, the traditional Mann Kendall trend test also used the same
   time series. The main results of this study include the following. (1)
   According to the Mann-Kendall trend test, the precipitation of all
   months at the Balykchy station showed a positive trend (except in
   January (Z(c) = -0.784) and July (Z(c) = 0.079)). At the Cholpon-Ata and
   Kyzyl-Suu stations, monthly precipitation (with the same month of
   multiple years averaged) indicated a decreasing trend in January, June,
   August, and November. At the monthly scale, significant increasing
   trends (Z(c) > Z(0.10) = 1.645) were detected in February and October
   for three stations. (2) The ITA method indicated that the rising trends
   were seen in 16 out of 36 months at the three stations, while six months
   showed decreasing patterns for ``high{''} monthly precipitation.
   According to the ``low{''} monthly precipitations, 14 months had an
   increasing trend, and four months showed a decreasing trend. Through the
   application of the ITA method (January, March, and August at Balykchy;
   December at Cholpon-Ata; and July and December at Kyzyl-Suu), there were
   some significant increasing trends, but the Mann-Kendall test found no
   significant trends. The significant trend occupies 19.4\% in the
   Mann-Kendall test and 36.1\% in the ITA method, which indicates that the
   ITA method displays more positive significant trends than Mann Kendall
   Z(c). (3) Compared with the classical Mann-Kendall trend results, the
   ITA method has some advantages. This approach allows more detailed
   interpretations about trend detection, which has benefits for
   identifying hidden variation trends of precipitation and the graphical
   illustration of the trend variability of extreme events, such as
   ``high{''} and ``low{''} values of monthly precipitation. In contrast,
   these cannot be discovered by applying traditional methods.},

Abstract = {Global warming has caused changes in air temperatures, ocean heat
   content, and sea levels, and these changes might strengthen tropical
   cyclones (TCs) around the Korean Peninsula and exacerbate the damage
   that these storms can have on both coastal and inland communities.
   Therefore, there is an urgent need in this region to update hazard
   mitigation plans for TCs and improve community resilience measures to
   cope with the corresponding damage. In accordance with such efforts,
   this study aims to build quantitative statistical datasets about
   typhoons in the northwestern Pacific Ocean that approach the Korean
   Peninsula and use these data to analyze the characteristics of typhoon
   activity (e.g., TC genesis location, TC path, recurving position, and
   intensity) and the accompanying spatio-temporal changes in rainfall.
   During 1966 to 2009, significant changes in the timing, paths, and
   frequencies of strong summer typhoons were observed along with increases
   in the intensity of summer typhoon rainfall over portions of the Han
   River basin and the Nakdong River basin. We hope that these findings
   will provide foundational information for disaster prevention efforts
   and assist natural resource managers to protect river basins and secure
   water resources. (C) 2015 International Association for

Abstract = {A new multilevel, hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to
   simultaneously identify clusters of stations with similar temporal
   patterns, the trend associated with each cluster and for the individual
   stations within each cluster. An application to the annual maximum daily
   precipitation in the United States for a common 70 year (1941-2010)
   period across the HADEX2 sites is presented. The model identifies
   statistically homogeneous regions, spatially clustering the data into
   groups according to the intensity and the trend. Partial pooling of
   model parameters for each group is considered. Spatially consistent
   trends are detected in the Midwest and Northeast U.S., at the cluster
   and at the station level. The new approach can dramatically improve
   trend identification for precipitation extremes; e.g., all 14 stations
   in the Midwest report a significant trend as opposed to only 4 stations
   based on single site analysis. The method is generally applicable for
   improving trend identification over a heterogeneous region.},

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {The trends in tropical cyclone (TC) induced wind and precipitation are
   estimated by applying a quantile regression to station data collected
   from mainland China. Results indicate that stations located close to the
   southeast coast show significant decreasing trends in annual windy days,
   maximum sustained wind and wind gusts, while positive trends in
   precipitation per TC and maximum 1-hr precipitation dominate over the
   south of the Yangtze River. The TC frequency is generally decreased over
   China, especially over south China. The location of significant trends
   in precipitation seems to be related to the mountains and coastline in
   southeast China. The influence of local conditions, such as topography
   and urbanization, on circulation may contribute to the spatial pattern
   of trends in influence of TC activity. The different behaviors of trends
   in wind and precipitation also necessitate a more thorough metrics for
   assessing the impacts of TCs. Citation: Ying, M., B. Chen, and G. Wu

   climate regions of China during 1961-2008},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},

Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Using high-quality precipitation data from 524 stations, the trends of a
   set of precipitation variables during the main rain season
   (May-September) from 1961 to 2008 for different climate regions in China
   were analysed. However, different characteristics were displayed in
   different regions of China. In most temperate monsoon regions
   (north-eastern China), total rain-season precipitation and precipitation
   days showed decreasing trends; positive tendencies in precipitation
   intensity were, however, noted for most stations in this region. It is
   suggested that the decrease in rain-season precipitation is mainly
   related to there being fewer rain days and a change towards drier
   conditions in north-eastern China, and as a result, the available water
   resources have been negatively affected in the temperate monsoon
   regions. In most subtropical and tropical monsoon climate regions
   (south-eastern China), the rain-season precipitation and precipitation
   days (11-50, with >50 mm) showed slightly positive trends. However,
   precipitation days with <= 10 mm decreased in these regions. Changes
   towards wetter conditions in this area, together with more frequent
   heavy rainfall events causing floods, have a severe impact on peoples'
   lives and socio-economic development. In general, the rain-season
   precipitation, precipitation days and rain-season precipitation
   intensity had all increased in the temperate continental and
   plateau/mountain regions of western China. This increase in rain-season
   precipitation has been favourable to pasture growth.},

Abstract = {Precipitation, as an important part of the hydrological cycle, is often
   related to flood and drought. In this study, we collected daily rainfall
   data from 21 rainfall stations in Shaanxi Province from 1961 to 2017,
   and calculated eight extreme climate indices. Annual and seasonal
   concentration indices (CI) were also calculated. The trends in the
   changes in precipitation were calculated using the M-K test and Sen's
   slope. The results show that the precipitation correlation index and CI
   (concentration index) in Shaanxi Province are higher in the south and
   lower in the north. For the annual scale, the CI value ranges from
   0.6369 to 0.6820, indicating that Shaanxi Province has a high
   precipitation concentration and an uneven distribution of annual
   precipitation. The eight extreme precipitation indices of most rainfall
   stations showed a downward trend during the study period, and more than
   half of the stations passed the 0.05 confidence interval test. Among
   them, the Z value of PRCPTOT (annual total precipitation in wet days) at
   Huashan station reached -6.5270. The lowest slope of PRCPTOT reached
   -14.3395. This shows that annual rainfall in Shaanxi Province has been
   decreasing in recent decades. These findings could be used to make
   decisions about water resources and drought risk management in Shaanxi
   Province, China.},

Abstract = {The present paper aims of computing climatology and trend analysis of
   occurrence and intensity of extreme events of precipitation in
   subregions of Northeast Brazil (NEB). We used daily rainfall data of 148
   rain gauges collected from the hydrometeorological network managed by
   the National Water Agency during 1972 to 2002 and used quantiles
   technique in order to select rainfall events. Defining heavy rainfall
   events as those when at least one rain gauge recorded rainfall above the
   95th percentile, normal rainfall was between the 45th and 55th
   percentiles, and weak rainfall events were under the 5th percentile. The
   Mann-Kendall nonparametric test was used to calculate the linear trend
   of the quantity and intensity of rainfall events. The NEB was divided in
   five subregions using the cluster analysis based on Euclidean distance
   and Ward's method: Northern coast, Northern semiarid, Northwest,
   Southern semiarid, and Southern coast. The results suggest that the
   subregions are less influenced by El Nio and La Nia, and dry areas have
   higher variability, with the greatest number of intense events.},

Title = {Trend and seasonality of land precipitation in observations and CMIP5

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the annual precipitation amounts, the
   seasonality over global land and their linear trends, as well as the
   uncertainties in two observations (precipitation reconstruction and
   Global Precipitation Climatology Centre), and then compared them with
   historical runs by multiple models. Overall, the large-scale patterns of
   both the climatology of the annual precipitation amount and the
   seasonality are consistent between the two observations. Nevertheless,
   some noticeable differences existed, particularly in the regions with
   fewer gauge observations, such as northern Africa and the Tibetan
   Plateau. For long-term changes, significant drying trends during
   1948-2005 were observed in the tropical areas of northern Africa,
   accompanied by significant wetting trends in the polar region of Canada.
   The seasonality change during the period was dominated by a decreasing
   trend in precipitation, especially in the western portion of Russia. The
   model simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5
   (CMIP5) reproduced the climatological mean state of annual precipitation
   and its seasonality in the observations, as well as to some extent the
   zonal mean trends of precipitation amounts, but did not reproduce the
   zonal mean trends of seasonality. The two-dimensional distribution of
   linear trends of annual precipitation and seasonality simulated by CMIP5
   models showed little consistency with their observational counterparts.
   One possibility for the inconsistencies was that they were largely
   determined by internal variations of the climate system rather than
   external forcings. In contrast, it might also suggest a challenge for
   state-of-the-art climate models to correctly simulate the spatial
   distribution of responses of annual precipitation amounts and
   seasonality to the evolution of external forcings. Our results suggest
   that, in addition to the precipitation amount, seasonality should be
   used as a metric to assess the ability of a climate model to simulate
   current climate conditions and project future climate change.},

Title = {Atlantic and Mediterranean-Sourced Precipitation over the Maghreb:
   Trends and Spatiotemporal Variability},

Abstract = {The Mediterranean basin is recognized as a potential focal point of
   global warming, marked by a rising incidence of both droughts and
   floods. Nevertheless, uncertainties persist regarding the precise impact
   of climate change on the water cycle in this region. Therefore, this
   study endeavors to scrutinize the recent precipitation trends and
   fluctuations across the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) and
   their connection to both the Atlantic and Mediterranean moisture
   sources. To spatialize these trends and variations, we used a satellite
   precipitation product that we have beforehand evaluated at different
   time scales. Furthermore, we employed two influential teleconnection
   patterns: the NAO index, representing Atlantic influence, and the WeMO
   index for theMediterranean influenceThe statistical assesment of the
   satellite-based rainfall data demonstrated strong correlations with
   ground-based rainfall, ranging from 0.45 to 0.8. The median Percentage
   Bias was found to be 10\%. The median Mean Absolute Error was
   approximately 12 mm, while the Root Mean Square Error averaged around 18
   mm. Overall, all chosen criteria yielded satisfactory outcomes,
   providing a suitable level of confidence for conducting spatio-temporal
   trend analysis at the pixel level. At temporal scale, the trend results
   showed some upward trends in precipitation in certain areas during the
   months of March, April, August, September, and October. However, for the
   remainder of the year, the dominant trend is a decrease in precipitation
   across most of the North African territories. At spatial scale, the
   findings unveiled a decline in precipitation levels in the central and
   southern regions, while showcasing an increase in precipitation across
   the northern Maghreb. Moreover, the sphere of influence exerted by the
   WeMO exhibited expansion, along with a notable amplification in its
   modulation of precipitation patterns, particularly from September to
   April. Conversely, the NAO exerted a more pronounced influence during
   the winter months.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the impact global climate change has had on the
   theoretical upper limit of precipitation for Utah's watersheds by
   examining historical trends in probable maximum precipitation (PMP), a
   metric widely used for dam construction and management. Trends in the
   factors of PMP driven by both frontal and monsoonal storm scenarios were
   studied using two networks of surface weather stations and modern
   gridded datasets spanning 1981-2018. It was found that the historical
   trend in both 3-hr and 24-hr PMP estimations exhibited a statistically
   significant increasing trend, despite that the magnitude of the trend
   was sensitive to which dataset was examined and the data's spatial
   resolution. Over the 24-hr time scale, an interesting deviation in PMP
   trends was found where frontal storm events demonstrated increasing PMP
   trends compared to decreasing PMP trends for monsoonal storm events.
   However, both storm types demonstrated increasing trends over shorter
   3-hr durations, suggesting a universal increase in convective storm
   intensity. PMP estimates also demonstrated a dependency on the type and
   resolution of meteorological data used, where higher-resolution data
   generally produced greater PMP values and weaker trends. A discussion on
   the potential causes of these dependencies is provided. This study
   implies the need to take the historical PMP trend into account for
   future PMP estimates, especially when coarse-resolution data are used
   for conventional PMP studies.},

   Climate Reanalysis Data},

Abstract = {Precipitation is one of the most variable climatic parameters, as it is
   determined by many physical processes. The spatiotemporal
   characteristics of precipitation have been significantly affected by
   climate change during the past decades. Analysis of precipitation trends
   is challenging, especially in regions such as Greece, which is
   characterized by complex topography and includes several ungauged areas.
   With this study, we aim to shed new light on the climatic
   characteristics and interannual trends of precipitation over Greece. For
   this purpose, we used ERA5 monthly precipitation data from 1950 to 2020
   to estimate annual Theil-Sen trends and Mann-Kendall significance over
   Greece and surrounding areas. Additionally, in order to analyze and
   model the nonlinear relationships of monthly precipitation time series,
   we used generalized additive models (GAMs). The results indicated
   significant declining inter-annual trends of areal precipitation over
   the study area. Declining trends were more pronounced in winter over
   western and eastern Greece, but trends in spring, summer and autumn were
   mostly not significant. GAMs showcased that the trends were generally
   characterized by nonlinearity and precipitation over the study area
   presented high inter-decadal variability. Combining the results, we
   concluded that precipitation did not linearly change during the past 7
   decades, but it first increased from the 1950s to the late 1960s,
   consequently decreased until the early 1990s and, afterwards, presented
   an increase until 2020 with a smaller rate than the 1950-1960s.},

Abstract = {Sample sizes of observed climate extremes are typically too small to
   reliably constrain return period estimates when there is non-stationary
   behaviour. To increase the historical record 100-fold, we apply the
   UNprecedented Simulated Extreme ENsemble (UNSEEN) approach, by pooling
   ensemble members and lead times from the ECMWF seasonal prediction
   system SEAS5. We fit the GEV distribution to the UNSEEN ensemble with a
   time covariate to facilitate detection of changes in 100-year
   precipitation values over a period of 35 years (1981-2015). Applying
   UNSEEN trends to 3-day precipitation extremes over Western Norway
   substantially reduces uncertainties compared to estimates based on the
   observed record and returns no significant linear trend over time. For
   Svalbard, UNSEEN trends suggests there is a significant rise in
   precipitation extremes, such that the 100-year event estimated in 1981
   occurs with a return period of around 40 years in 2015. We propose a
   suite of methods to evaluate UNSEEN and highlight paths for further
   developing UNSEEN trends to investigate non-stationarities in climate
   extremes.},

Abstract = {A statistical analysis of the daily maximum and mean monthly
   precipitation measured at ten meteorological stations in Serbia during
   the period 1949-2007 is presented. Although the means of the daily
   maximum and monthly precipitation varied throughout the year, their
   ratio was almost uniform, with an average value of 32.6\% for Serbia.
   The precipitation events within each year were ranked and then the
   trends on the ten wettest days of the year were assessed. Averaged
   across Serbia, the wettest day of the year produces 41.3 mm of
   precipitation and accounted for 6.3\% of the total annual precipitation.
   Taken together, 35.5\% (232.0 mm) of the total annual precipitation fell
   during the ten wettest days of the year. Over the course of the
   twentieth century, the average annual precipitation on the wettest day
   across Serbia increased by nearly 9\%. Also, averaged across Serbia,
   statistically insignificant increasing trends were found on each of the
   ten wettest days of the year. Furthermore, four climate indices were
   analysed. Heavy precipitation indices (i.e., RR20 and R95T) increased in
   Serbia at the end of the twentieth century and thereafter.},

Title = {Extreme Precipitation Indices Trend Assessment over the Upper Oueme
   River Valley-(Benin)},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study analyzed trends in extreme precipitation based on daily
   rainfall data provided by Benin Meteo Agency for the Upper Oueme valley
   in Benin over the period 1951-2014. Eleven indices divided into two
   groups were considered. The first group consists of frequency indices:
   number of heavy rainfall days, very heavy rainfall days and extremely
   heavy rainfall days; and maximum number of Consecutive dry days and wet
   days. The second group concerns intensity: daily maximum rainfall
   (RX1day), maximum five-day rainfall (RX5day), annual total wet-day
   rainfall (PRCPTOT), simple daily intensity index (SDII), very wet day
   (R95P) and extremely wet day rainfall (R99P). The non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test was used to assess trends in those indices. The
   results show that only 30\% of the stations experienced decreasing
   trends for the number of heavy rainfall days (R10mm) and daily maximum
   rainfall (RX1day). For the annual total wet-day rainfall (PRCPTOT), the
   simple daily intensity index (SDII) and the very wet day rainfall
   (R95P), 20\% of stations faced significant negative trends. In addition,
   the decreasing trends are observed for 10\% stations considering the
   number of very heavy rainfall days (R20mm), the maximum five-day
   rainfall (RX5day) and the extremely wet day rainfall (R99P). About the
   increasing trend, 10\% stations are identified for the number of
   consecutive dry days (CDD), very heavy rainfall days (R20mm), the daily
   maximum rainfall (RX1day), the simple daily intensity index, and the
   extremely wet day rainfall (R99P). These results show the absence of
   clear trend of climate indices evolution in almost all stations.
   Consequently, uncertainties in the evolution of rainfall indices must be
   taken into account in the definition of adaptation strategies for flood
   or drought risks. Similarly, these results show a slight drop in the dry
   sequences of the 1970s and 1980s revealed in the region by previous
   studies.},

Title = {Autumn Precipitation Trends over Southern Hemisphere Midlatitudes as
   Simulated by CMIP5 Models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {26},
Number = {21},
Pages = {8341-8356},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent decades, Southern Hemisphere midlatitude regions such as
   southern Africa, southeastern Australia, and southern Chile have
   experienced a reduction in austral autumn precipitation; the cause of
   which is poorly understood. This study focuses on the ability of global
   climate models that form part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project phase 5 to simulate these trends, their relationship with
   extratropical and subtropical processes, and implications for future
   precipitation changes. Models underestimate both the historical autumn
   poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone and the positive southern
   annular mode (SAM) trend. The multimodel ensemble (MME) is also unable
   to capture the spatial pattern of observed precipitation trends across
   semiarid midlatitude regions. However, in temperate regions that are
   located farther poleward such as southern Chile, the MME simulates
   observed precipitation declines. The MME shows a strong consensus in
   twenty-first-century declines in autumn precipitation across southern
   Chile in both the medium-low and high representative concentration
   pathway (RCP) scenarios and across southern Africa in the high RCP
   scenario, but little change across southeastern Australia. Projecting a
   strong positive SAM trend and continued subtropical dry-zone expansion,
   the models converge on large SAM and dry-zone-expansion-induced
   precipitation declines across southern midlatitudes. In these regions,
   the strength of future precipitation trends is proportional to the
   strength of modeled trends in these phenomena, suggesting that unabated
   greenhouse gas-induced climate change will have a large impact on
   austral autumn precipitation in such midlatitude regions.},

Abstract = {An investigation was carried out to identify trends in the rainfall and
   temperature regimes of the Ganga basin in India and in India as a whole.
   Long-term data on the monsoon and annual rainfall and the average annual
   temperature for India as a whole, and on the monsoon rainfall, number of
   rainy days and annual maximum temperature of the Ganga basin were
   analysed. The trends in these data were detected using non-parametric
   methods. The results of this study showed that the rainfall variables
   had a decreasing trend and the temperature had an increasing trend.
   These trends were observed to have begun around the second half of the
   1960s, and have implications for the Indian economy. As the Indian
   economy continues to be based on agriculture, water resource management
   for irrigation plays a vital part in its growth. Present methods of
   design and management for water resource systems assume the climatic
   regime to be stationary. If indeed the climatic regime has changed, it
   will be necessary to develop new management approaches which consider
   this change.},

Abstract = {Iran is located in one of the Earth's dry belts. Subtropical
   high-pressure and inland deserts have created arid and semiarid
   conditions for about 75\% of the country's area. In addition to this
   natural dryness, recent global climate change has also affected
   precipitation in different parts of Iran in terms of both mean and
   extreme amounts. Precipitation extremes can have many negative effects
   on different parts of the Earth's ecosystems. The possible pattern of
   precipitation trends during recent years merits further study given the
   potentially important impacts on agriculture and water resources in
   Iran. Globally, observations show significant changes in the
   characteristics of extreme precipitation. To study recent trends in mean
   and extreme precipitation events in Iran, we examined a number of mean
   and extreme precipitation indices for a 58-year period (1960-2017) for
   33 synoptic stations throughout the country. Daily precipitation data
   were collected from the Iranian Meteorological Organization for this
   period for all stations. Nine precipitation-based indices (one mean and
   eight extreme) were employed to study precipitation trends. The results
   showed that most areas have undergone a significant increasing trend in
   extreme precipitation values, precipitation intensity, and precipitation
   frequency. Significant positive trends were seen in the southwestern
   regions of Iran and the coasts of the Persian Gulf for the same
   precipitation indices. The results of this study could be used by
   managers and experts for long-term planning.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to detect possible trend in monthly total

   recently proposed by Sen trend tests. The new method is used for trend
   analysis of monthly total precipitation data recorded at Samsun,
   Trabzon, Ankara, Yozgat, Adana, and Antalya provinces in Turkey. For
   comparison purposes, the well-known MK trend test is also applied to the
   same data. According to the MK trend test, Samsun and Trabzon generally
   have statistically significant increasing trend. There is no
   statistically significant trend (trendless time series) for Ankara,
   Yozgat, and Adana provinces. While the February month of Antalya shows
   statistically significant decreasing trend, April month of Antalya shows
   statistically significant increasing trend. According to the Sen's trend
   test, peak and low values of monthly total precipitation of the six
   provinces show different trends (increasing, decreasing, or trendless
   time series) from the MK trend test. The study shows that the Sen method
   could be successfully used in evaluation of peak and low values of data

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {38},
Month = {APR 19},
Abstract = {The analysis of the GPCP and CMAP datasets during the past 30 years
   (1979-2008) indicates that there are consistent increasing trends in
   both the global monsoon area (GMA) and the global monsoon total
   precipitation (GMP). This positive monsoon rainfall trend differs from
   previous studies that assumed a fixed global monsoon domain. Due to the
   increasing trends in both the GMA and GMP, a global monsoon intensity
   (GMI) index, which measures the global monsoon precipitation amount per
   unit area, is introduced. The GMI measures the strength of the global
   monsoon. Our calculations with both the GPCP and CMAP datasets show a
   consistent downward trend in the GMI over the past 30 years. This
   decreasing trend is primarily attributed to a greater percentage
   increase in the GMA than in the GMP. A further diagnosis reveals that
   the decrease of the GMI is primarily attributed to the land monsoon in
   the GPCP, but to the oceanic monsoon in the CMAP. Citation: Hsu, P.-C.,

Title = {Precipitation composition in the Ohio River Valley: Spatial variability

Abstract = {Sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) concentrations in
   precipitation as measured at NADP sites within the Ohio River Valley of
   the Midwestern USA between 1985 and 2002 are quantified and temporal
   trends attributed to changes/ variations in (i) the precipitation
   regime, (ii) emission patterns and (iii) air mass trajectories. The
   results indicate that mean SO42- concentrations in precipitation
   declined by 37-43\% between 1985 and 2002, while NO3- concentrations
   decreased by 1-32\%, and NH4+ concentrations exhibited declining
   concentrations at some sites and increasing concentrations at others.
   The change in SO42- concentrations is in broad agreement with estimated
   reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions. Changes in NO3- concentrations
   appear to be less closely related to variations in emissions of oxides
   of nitrogen and exhibit a stronger dependence on weekly precipitation
   volume. Up to one quarter of the variability in log-transformed weekly
   NO3- concentrations in precipitation is explicable by variations in
   precipitation volume. Trends in annual average log-transformed SO42-
   concentrations exhibit only a relatively small influence of variability
   in weekly precipitation amount but at each of the sites considered the
   variance explanation of annual average log-transformed SO42- by sampling
   year was increased by removing the influence of precipitation volume.
   Annual mean log-transformed ion concentrations detrended for
   precipitation volume (by week) and emission changes (by year) exhibit
   positive correlations at all sites, indicating that the residual
   variability of SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ may have a common source which is
   postulated to be linked to synoptic scale variability and air mass
   trajectories.},

   South Korea},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {High spatial and temporal variation in precipitation in South Korea
   leads to an increase in the frequency and duration of drought. In this
   study, the spatial characteristics of temporal trends for precipitation
   and drought severity time series were analyzed at 55 stations across
   South Korea for the period 1980-2015. This study also reviewed the
   usefulness of different trend tests while addressing the issue of serial
   correlation, which has often received less attention in previous
   studies. Results showed that most significant trends in precipitation
   were detected along the south coast of South Korea, especially during
   winter, late spring and summer, whereas no significant trend was
   detected in annual precipitation. The Sen's slope of the trends
   increased from January to August and decreased from August onward.
   Principal component analysis applied on Standardized Precipitation Index
   (SPI) at a 12-month time scale divides the whole of South Korea into
   four subregions with different temporal behaviors of drought severity.
   Moreover, drought severity showed a significant increasing trend, mainly
   on the northeast coast. Drought frequency analysis showed more frequent
   droughts in late winter, early spring and early autumn, with less
   frequent droughts in summer.},

Abstract = {Based on daily station precipitation data, this study investigates the
   trends in light precipitation events (less than the 50th percentile)
   over global land during 1961-2010. It is found that the frequency of
   light precipitation events decreases over East China (EC) and northern
   Eurasia (NE) but increases over the United States of America (US),
   Australia (AU), and the Iberian Peninsula (IP). However, the trends in
   the intensity of light precipitation events are opposite to those in
   frequency. We find that the trends in light precipitation events are
   possibly associated with the changes in static stability. Over EC and NE
   (US, AU, and IP), the static stability weakens (strengthens) during
   1961-2010. The weakening (strengthening) of static stability leads to
   increase (decrease) in precipitation intensity due to the enhancement
   (reduction) of upward motion; light (relatively heavier) precipitation
   events accordingly shift toward relatively heavier (light)
   precipitation, and the frequency of light precipitation events decreases
   (increases) consequently.},

Abstract = {Southern Portugal experiences the lowest amounts of annual precipitation
   and the highest level of susceptibility to soil erosion, drought events
   and desertification phenomena in mainland Portugal. The first goal of
   this paper was to analyse spatial variability and trends in annual
   precipitation and erosivity in southern mainland Portugal for the period
   1950/1951-2007/2008. The second objective was to evaluate seasonality in
   relation to precipitation distribution, erosivity and concentration over
   the same period and to evaluate and detect possible changes in the time
   trend for precipitation erosivity. In order to achieve these objectives,
   the annual and seasonal precipitation figures, corresponding to data
   from 90 rain gauges, were analysed and the Modified Fournier Index and
   Precipitation Concentration Index calculated for each station. The
   results obtained revealed distinct behaviour patterns for yearly
   precipitation, erosivity and concentration trends. Decreases in annual
   precipitation and erosivity figures accompanied by increases in
   precipitation concentration were found. Nevertheless, no generalised
   significant trends have been detected for these variables. In seasonal
   terms, there was a general trend towards an increase in amount,
   concentration and precipitation erosivity in autumn and summer, and a
   significantly reducing in winter. The increase in precipitation
   erosivity, particularly in the autumn, the most water-erosive season,
   suggests a rising in potential soil erosion risk in southern Portugal.

Abstract = {{[} 1] The consistency of long-term yearly precipitation and runoff
   trends over the largest Arctic watersheds ( Ob, Yenisei and Lena Rivers)
   is examined. Three gridded precipitation datasets ( Climatic Research
   Unit, University of Delaware, NCEP) are used for comparative analyses
   with runoff data collected at basin outlets. The results generally
   demonstrate inconsistency in long-term changes of basin precipitation
   and runoff. The Yenisei River runoff increases significantly, while
   precipitation data show mostly negative trends. The Ob River does not
   show any significant trend either in precipitation or runoff. Positive
   trend in the Lena River runoff is accompanied by a weak precipitation
   increase; however, the precipitation increase is not strong enough to
   support the observed runoff change. The inconsistency identified in
   basin precipitation and runoff trends suggests uncertainty in both the
   quality of basin precipitation and runoff datasets, as well as the
   perceived hydrologic factors impacting runoff change.},

Abstract = {Climate change, burgeoning population, rapid urbanization, and
   over-exploited use of natural resources-such alarming situations require
   immediate interventions to plan and manage water resources sustainably.
   In present study, the study area is comprised of eight districts
   covering five different agro-climatic zones of North Karnataka. The
   objective of this study is to investigate the spatial distribution of
   the long-term precipitation concentration index (PCI). In pursuit of
   these objectives, the methodology employed in this research involves
   utilizing the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator to identify
   trends in long-term rainfall patterns. The annual precipitation
   concentration index and seasonal precipitation concentration index were
   calculated based on Karnataka State Natural Disaster Mitigation Centre
   meteorological data. The estimation of rainfall distribution is compared
   in Regular intervals of time for different time series (1961-1989) and
   (1990-2018). The results show that the annual PCI values vary between 14
   and 52. These values indicate the precipitation at annual scale is more
   of moderately irregular except in zone 9 which is a wet (hilly) zone
   dominated by a dry period of 8 months in a year. The findings of the
   study reveal significant variations in the distribution of precipitation
   across the North Interior Zones of Karnataka. The analysis of the Annual
   Precipitation Concentration Index highlights the localized variations in
   rainfall, reflecting the diverse climatic conditions within the study
   area. The trend analysis of the rainfall data indicates long-term
   changes in precipitation patterns, which could have implications for
   water resource management.},

Abstract = {Global warming causes changing on climate system which driving extreme
   climate and metrological event. The occurrence of extreme event, such as
   extreme precipitation can lead to flooding and drought which can have an
   impact on agriculture production. To observe the extreme event, Expert
   Team for Climate Change Detection Indices (ETCCDI) developed 27 extreme
   indices which are 11 extreme precipitation indices and 16 extreme
   temperature indices. In this study, we analyze the trend of extreme
   precipitation indices to understand the changing of precipitation in
   Southern part of Java. Extreme precipitation indices were analyzed using
   Climpact2. Trend significance of extreme indices time series were
   calculated using non-parametric Mann-Kendall Test. Spatial distribution
   of the annual trend in each index illustrated using IDW interpolation.
   Most of significant trend in extreme precipitation indices occurred in
   North West station of study area. Negative significant trend only
   happened on consecutive wet days (CWD) index that means wet days was
   decrease. Positive significant trend happened in every index exclude
   consecutive dry days (CDD), Number of heavy precipitation days number of
   heavy precipitation days (R10mm), and PRCPTOT. Precipitation in study
   area occur with high intensity in short period.},

Title = {Long-term atmospheric visibility, sunshine duration and precipitation

Abstract = {The fast industrialization and urbanization in South China have led to
   increasing concentration of aerosols, which has caused the degradation
   of atmospheric visibility and substantially impacted on cloud properties
   and the initiation of precipitation in this region. Therefore, it is
   valuable to study the spatial and temporal trends of atmospheric
   visibility, sunshine duration and precipitation in recent years in the
   region to understand how aerosols affect the environment. In this
   article, meteorological data of 28 stations in South China were obtained
   from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System and were
   analyzed using several different statistical methods. The stations were
   divided into four categories: prefecture, county, neighbor, and remote
   stations. The data show a decrease of visibility in 93\% of the stations
   during 1980-2012, among which the neighbor stations have recorded the
   fastest average decrease of -1.8 km/decade. The average visibility for
   all the stations over the 33 years is 16.8 km and the total average
   decreasing rate is -1.3 km/decade. The percentages of ``high{''}
   visibility in prefecture, county and neighbor stations decreased
   dramatically, while the percentages of ``low{''} visibility in
   aforementioned stations were much higher than those in the remote
   stations. As for the sunshine duration, the neighbor stations have
   recorded the rapidest decrease in the recent 30 years, while the data of
   the prefecture stations showed the most significant change during
   1957-2012. The annual average daily rainfall of rainy days shows a
   significant increase during 1978-1985 in the dry seasons and 1990-2000
   in the wet seasons, respectively. The percentage of rainy days per year
   had been decreasing linearly during 1980-2010. Light rain days had been
   decreasing in all the types of stations, though such change is the
   smallest in remote stations. Meanwhile, torrential rain and rainstorm
   days have been increasing, especially in the prefecture stations. By
   using the empirical orthogonal function (EDF) and detrended
   cross-correlations analysis (DCCA), we may conclude that visibility and
   rainfall have cross-correlation, which shows more complex multifractal
   structure in Guangzhou (a prefecture station) than in Gaoyao (a neighbor
   station) and Lianping (a remote station). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Mesoscale Spatial Variability of Linear Trend of Precipitation
   Statistics in Korean Peninsula},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {This study analyzed the spatial variability of the linear trend of the
   precipitation mean, variance, lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient, and
   probability of dryness (PD) based on the precipitation data between 1981
   and 2015 observed at 65 rain gages located across Korean Peninsula.
   While the result of the Mann-Kendall test based on the yearly statistics
   showed no temporal trend at most of the gage locations, the same test
   based on the 20-yearly statistics showed that statistically significant
   temporal trend exists at 54\% (mean), 60\% (variance), 61\%
   (autocorrelation), and 61\% (PD) among the total 65 rain gages. In
   addition, this study produced the map of the linear trend of the
   precipitation statistics. The map showed a clear regional and seasonal
   tendency implying that the impact of the climate change varies
   significantly within Korea. The variogram analysis revealed that the
   approximate characteristic scale of linear trend of hourly and daily
   precipitation statistics ranges between 50 km and 200 km and between 100
   km and 250 km, respectively. This characteristic scale is significantly
   smaller than the spatial scale of atmospheric circulation, which
   suggests that future water resources management plans of Korea should
   consider this mesoscale variability that otherwise can be missed if it
   is based only on the GCM simulation results.},

Abstract = {The variability of spatial and temporal trends in extreme precipitation
   indices and the trend directions were studied for the meteorological
   seasons of 1950 to 2010. A daily precipitation dataset from 15 weather
   stations in Pakistan was used. Seven indices were chosen: total
   precipitation from events a parts per thousand yen 90th, 95th, and 99th
   percentiles, the number of days with precipitation a parts per thousand
   yen 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of daily precipitation amounts, and
   annual dry days. A study investigating temporal changes in the spatial
   extent of statistically significant extreme precipitation events was
   performed. Trends were calculated for each of the 30-year moving periods
   within the 1950-2010 time period using a simple linear regression
   technique and Kendall's tau-based slope estimator. A distinct spatial
   differentiation appeared in the prevailing directional trends between
   the northern and southwestern parts of the study area. In all seasons,
   increasing trends in extreme precipitation dominated in northeastern
   Pakistan, whereas a reducing tendency towards extreme precipitation
   prevails in the southwestern part of the country.},

Title = {Coast-to-interior gradient in recent northwest Greenland precipitation
   trends (1952-2012)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2015},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability of precipitation on the Greenland
   ice sheet is an essential component of surface mass balance, which has
   been declining in recent years with rising temperatures. We present an
   analysis of precipitation trends in northwest (NW) Greenland (1952-2012)
   using instrumental (coastal meteorological station) and proxy records
   (snow pits and ice cores) to characterize the precipitation gradient
   from the coast to the ice sheet interior. Snow-pit-derived precipitation
   near the coast (1950-2000) has increased (similar to 7\% decade(-1), p <
   0.01) whereas there is no significant change observed in interior snow
   pits. This trend holds for 1981-2012, where calculated precipitation
   changes decrease in magnitude with increasing distance from the coast:
   13\% decade(-1) (2.4 mm water equivalent (w.e.) decade(-2)) at coastal
   Thule air base (AB), 8.6\% decade(-1) (4.7 mm w.e. decade(-2)) at the
   2Barrel ice core site 150 km from Thule AB, -5.2\% decade(-1) (1.7 mm
   w.e. decade(-2)) at Camp Century located 205 km from Thule AB, and 4.4\%
   decade(-1) (1.0 mm w.e. decade(-2)) at B26 located 500 km from Thule AB.
   In general, annually averaged precipitation and annually and seasonally
   averaged mean air temperatures observed at Thule AB follow trends
   observed in composite coastal Greenland time series, with both notably
   indicating winter as the fastest warming season in recent periods
   (1981-2012). Trends (1961-2012) in seasonal precipitation differ,
   specifically with NW Greenland summer precipitation increasing (similar
   to 0.6 mm w.e. decade(-2)) in contrast with decreasing summer
   precipitation in the coastal composite time series (3.8 mm w.e.
   decade(-2)). Differences in precipitation trends between NW Greenland
   and coastal composite Greenland underscore the heterogeneity in climate
   influences affecting precipitation. In particular, recent (1981-2012)
   changes in NW Greenland annual precipitation are likely a response to a
   weakening North Atlantic oscillation.},

   found at only two stations. The significant decreasing trends of -40.3

   and Gore stations started in the late 1970s and early 1980s
   respectively, which is consistent with the devastating droughts and
   famine during that period in the region. Owing to the great contribution
   of the main rainy season's (June to September: JJAS) precipitation to
   annual precipitation in the upper Blue Nile basin, the variation pattern
   of the JJAS precipitation is very similar to that of annual
   precipitation. Insignificant decreasing/increasing trends in the short
   rainy season's (March to May: MAM) precipitation are clearly predominant
   in the basin, where only one significant decreasing trend is detected in
   the time series.},

Abstract = {The compilation and reconstruction of a dataset integrated by 66 long
   monthly precipitation series, covering mainland Spain and the Balearic
   Islands, is presented. The reconstruction is based on the hypothesis
   that the cessation of data recording at one observatory is followed by
   the establishment of a new observatory very close to the closed one. In
   order to detect and adjust for possible multiple change points or shifts
   that could exist in the precipitation series, the R-package CLIMATOL
   V2.0 is used. This method enables to take advantage of the whole
   historical Spanish precipitation network in the detection and correction
   of inhomogeneities. The analysis of annual precipitation trends indicate
   a high temporal variability. Negative trends dominate for the period
   1951-2008 but not for all observatories. On the other hand, positive
   trends can be detected in the northern Spain for 1902-2008.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the correlation between precipitation and
   deforestation and trends in the Brazilian Amazon Biome from 1985 to 2021
   using rain gauge measurements. A total of 187 stations were selected
   after filtering time series with less than 10\% of missing data.
   Deforestation data was acquired using the MapBiomas dataset. Results
   show that deforestation rates vary across different locations and may be
   influenced by various factors. The analysis also found significant
   negative correlations between precipitation and deforestation, with a
   range of - 0.49 to - 0.33, as well as significant positive correlations,
   with a range of 0.34 to 0.57. These findings underscore the importance
   of continued monitoring of precipitation patterns in the region and the
   urgent need for measures to mitigate deforestation, which is critical
   for the hydrological cycle of the region. The highest deforestation
   rates and values were found between latitude 0 and - 12.5, where the arc
   of deforestation lies. Additionally, this study found a significant
   negative correlation between precipitation patterns and deforestation,
   indicating that deforestation led to a reduction in rainfall in the
   region.},

Abstract = {In this study, long term changes and trends in the annual rainfall of
   the Antalya Part, which is the region located in the western
   Mediterranean coast of Turkey containing many agricultural areas in its
   surrounding, were analysed. The aim of this study was to analyse the
   long term changes and trends in rainfall totals and present spatial
   distributions of annual and seasonal rainfall variability over the part.
   Rainfall data from 7 meteorological stations (Antalya, Alanya, Manavgat,
   Gazipasa, Finike, Korkuteli and Elmali) covering the years 1970-2011
   were used in this study. Prepared rainfall variation maps clearly show
   that the highest annual variation is Antalya, while the lowest variation
   is Manavgat. According to the results obtained in trend analysis, in
   general, while a decreasing trend in winter rainfall is apparent, there
   is an apparent increasing trend in autumn rainfall. These results show a
   shift in seasons causing long-term droughts and potential infertile land
   to emerge. At some stations in the vicinity, there has been a prominent
   change from humid conditions to semi-arid conditions from beginning of
   2000s. This study is expected to contribute to better understanding the
   effects of global climate change over precipitation in Antalya vicinity.

Abstract = {Trend of precipitation and runoff in major Chinese rivers was calculated
   and compared in order to better quantify the hydrological processes and
   evaluate the role of human activities in changing river discharge.
   Records from 160 meteorological stations in China show that from 1951 to
   2000 precipitation has increased (2\%) in the south but decreased (4 to
   11\%) in the north. Hydrological data from 22 stations in five major
   Chinese rivers reveal that over the same period in the south runoff of
   Pearl River (Zhujiang) increased by 10\% but Yangtze (Changjiang) runoff
   had little change. In the north flows in the Yellow (Huanghe), Liao and
   Songhua rivers decreased by 80\%, 54\% and 14\%, respectively, all
   statistically significant based on Mann-Kendall trend analysis. Annual
   runoff in the Pearl and Yangtze rivers is correlated with basin-wide
   precipitation (R-2 of 0.72 and 0.81). Runoff from northern ``deficit{''}
   rivers, however, was much lower than precipitation suggested, reflecting
   severe human impacts. Sub-basin analyses show that runoff in the
   ``excess{''} southern Yangtze has increased more than precipitation
   would suggest, most likely indicating decreased water storage, decreased
   evapotranspiration, or both. In contrast, the marked decreases of runoff
   in northern sub-basins (including northern Yangtze and middle-lower
   Yellow) reflect drastically increased water consumption. The water
   crisis in northern China has been exacerbated by decreasing
   precipitation, doubling population and expanding water withdrawal,
   putting pressure on water management and economic development. (C) 2010

   The time series analysis has been deduced by using a `'quick test'' for

   filters, the Mann-Kendall rank statistic, and a progressive test for
   trend according to Sneyers. From this analysis, the stationarity in time
   series of annual precipitation totals is stated over the entire interval
   at all locations except for a very short interval during the first
   decade of the twentieth century over the continental lowland (Osijek). A
   generally decreasing trend is present over the entire interval, but is
   statistically significant only in the continental lowland (Osijek).},

Abstract = {Rainfall is time concentric in nature. The spatial and temporal
   distribution of rainfall is changing over the Earth with recent
   anthropogenic warming. The study explores various characteristics of
   annual and seasonal concentration of rainfall across India using the
   precipitation concentration index (PCI) and its trends during the period
   of 1986-2015, based on a high-resolution gauge-based rainfall data (0.25
   x 0.25 degrees), obtained from the India Meteorological Department
   (IMD). An intercomparison is made with 11 other gridded rainfall
   datasets to infer whether these datasets can reasonably reproduce the
   spatiotemporal distribution of PCI and its trends in various homogenous
   rainfall regions of India or not. These datasets are categorized into
   gauge-based (APHRODITE, GPCC, CPC), satellite-derived (CHIRPS,
   PERSIANN-CDR), and reanalysis (JRA-55, MERRA-2, NCEP-2, PGF,
   ERA-Interim, ERA-5). On annual scale, about 8.52, 24.1, and 67.38\% of
   area of India are under moderate, irregular, and strongly irregular
   rainfall distribution, respectively. Spatial variation of PCI in India
   is influenced by geographical factors such as latitude, longitude, and
   elevation. Significant increasing and decreasing trends in annual PCI
   have been observed in the northeast, eastern, and western coasts of
   India, respectively. Gridded data intercomparison suggests that the
   gauge-based APHRODITE, GPCC, and satellite-derived CHIRPS datasets
   better perform in capturing the temporal and spatial variation of PCI
   across India when compared to the IMD gridded dataset, whereas the ERA-5
   performs better among the reanalysis datasets. However, the rainfall
   datasets exhibited marked differences with the IMD while estimating the
   annual and seasonal trend and its magnitude across various regions of
   India. The JRA-55 overestimated areas of positive trend and its
   magnitude on annual and seasonal scale. These findings have practical
   implications for hydroclimatic studies.},

Title = {External Forcings Caused the Tripole Trend of Asian Precipitation During
   the Holocene},

Abstract = {To investigate the evolution of precipitation over Asian continent in
   the Holocene and the associated mechanisms, we used a set of simulations
   of the transient climate evolution over the past 21,000 years
   (TraCE-21ka), multimodel results from the Paleoclimate Modeling
   Intercomparison Project Phase 4 (PMIP4), and proxy records in Asia. The
   TraCE-21ka results showed a tripole pattern in suborbital-scale
   precipitation trends over the Asian continent during the Holocene, with
   a trend of increase over southern parts of the monsoon regions and arid
   Central Asia (ACA), and a trend of decline over northern parts of the
   monsoon regions and their areas of transition with ACA. This tripole
   pattern was corroborated by proxy records from multiple regions and
   multimodel results from the PMIP4. Further analysis based on
   single-forcing simulations of TraCE-21ka indicated that influences from
   different external forcings were different on the Asian precipitation in
   the main rainy seasons in the Holocene and that their combined effects
   shaped the tripole pattern. In summer, orbital forcing, by reducing
   solar radiation in mid-to-high latitudes and weakening the land-sea
   thermal contrast, has been the dominant factor in the long-term
   evolution of precipitation in the monsoon region and West Asia. In
   winter and spring, changes in meltwater flux played dominant roles in
   intensifying local water cycle and horizontal moisture advection, which
   drove the trend of increase in precipitation in ACA. Additionally,
   changes in greenhouse gas concentration and continental ice sheet
   forcings both also contribute to the increase in precipitation in ACA.},

Title = {Establishing SMMS approach to accurately mine the characteristics of
   regional precipitation trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {627},
Number = {B},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Under the joint influence of climate change and human activities, the
   temporal and spatial variability and trend of precipitation have
   changed. The trend of precipitation investigated using traditional
   methods is quite different, which may be opposite of that at adjacent
   stations. This contradiction may lead to erroneous decision making in
   regional water resources planning and management, and may cause safety
   hazard. In order to evaluate the variation in temporal and spatial
   characteristics of regional precipitation and avoid different trends of
   regional precipitation time series, this study developed System
   clustering -Maximum entropy -Multi window sliding trend -Same frequency
   trend (SMMS) approach, which leads to the method for analyzing regional
   precipitation changes, trends, and laws. The local microclimate zones
   (LMZs) are redefined, so that the general law of precipitation variation
   will not be significantly different from the actual situation and the
   SMMS method is more accurate and comprehensive in identifying regional
   precipitation trends compared to traditional methods. Making use of the
   SMMS approach, the trend analysis of regional representative stations
   method can not only reasonably divide the study area and reduce
   computational complexity, but also analyze it according to the typical
   representative station with the maximum regional information.
   Furthermore, the impact caused by the length of data can be avoided, and
   the trend of precipitation intensity can be identified. It is necessary
   to fully understand the new characteristics of temporal and spatial
   changes of precipitation and make early preparations to mitigate the
   potential impact of climate or weather disasters.},

Title = {Seasonal precipitation in south-central Chile: Trends in extreme events

Journal = {ATMOSFERA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {371-384},

Abstract = {We study a regional precipitation time series built upon seven
   meteorological records from south-central Chile (SCC; 37 degrees-42
   degrees S), which altogether cover the period 1900-2019. As a first
   objective, we investigated changes in the return period (RP) of dry (
   P20) and wet ( P80) seasonal extreme events of precipitation (SEE) for
   each season. We observed a reduction in the RP of wet SEE during
   1900-1950 in all seasons. Moreover, the dry SEE RP shows a reduction
   from 1950 to the present in all seasons. This phenomenon is noteworthy
   since 1900 for summer and winter, and since 1930 for autumn. Spring
   registers a constant RP value from 1990 onwards. As a second objective,
   we study possible relationships between seasonal precipitation
   variability and climate modes, such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM)
   and the Tripole Index (TPI) of sea surface temperature (SST) over the
   Pacific Ocean. Summer and autumn precipitation showed a significant
   negative correlation with SAM activity at interannual and decadal
   scales, while winter and spring precipitation recorded a significant
   positive correlation with SST variability over multiple regions of the
   Pacific Ocean (including the tropics and New Zealand) and the Southern
   Ocean (Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea). Finally, we confirm that SAM
   strongly modulates precipitation in SCC, especially in autumn, and that
   SEE variability in SCC is considerably associated with climate modes of
   tropical and extra-tropical origin.},

Title = {Linear and Nonlinear Trend Analyzes in Global Satellite-Based
   Precipitation, 1998-2017},
Journal = {EARTHS FUTURE},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Precipitation varies spatio-temporally in amount, intensity, and
   frequency. Although, much research has been conducted on analyzing
   precipitation patterns and variation at the global scale, trend types
   have still not received much attention. This study developed a new
   polynomial-based model for detecting nonlinear and linear trends in a
   satellite precipitation product (TRMM 3B43) for the 1998-2017 period at
   a near-global scale. We used an automated trend classification method
   that detects significant trends and classifies them into linear and
   nonlinear (cubic, quadratic, and concealed) trend types in
   satellite-based precipitation at near-global, continental, and climate
   zone scales. We found that 12.3\% of pixel-based precipitation time
   series across the globe have significant trend at 0.05 significance
   level (50\% positive and 50\% negative trends). In all continents except
   Asia, decreasing trends were found to cover larger areas than
   corresponding increasing trends. Regarding climate zone and
   precipitation trend change, our results indicate that a linear trend is
   dominant in the warm temperate (77.7\%) and equatorial climates (80.4\%)
   while the least linear change was detected in the polar climate
   (68.9\%). The combined results of continental and climate zone scales
   indicate significant increasing trends in Asia and arid climate over the
   last 20 yr. Furthermore, positive trends were found to be more
   significant at the continental scale, particularly, in Asia relative to
   the climate zone scale. Linear change in precipitation (80\%) was the
   most dominant trend observed as opposed to nonlinear (quadratic {[}11\%]
   and cubic {[}9\%]) trend types at the global scale.},

Abstract = {This study researched the precipitation variability across 53
   meteorological stations in Mauritius and different subregions of the
   island, over a 30-year study period (1981-2010). Time series was
   investigated for each 5-year interval and also for the whole study
   period. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rho statistical tests
   were used to detect trends in annual precipitation. A mix of positive
   (increasing) and negative (decreasing) trends was highlighted for the
   5-year interval analysis. The statistical tests nevertheless agreed on
   the overall trend for Mauritius and the subregions. Most regions showed
   a decrease in precipitation during the period 1996-2000. This is
   attributed to the 1998-2000 drought period which was brought about by a
   moderate La Nina event. In general, an increase in precipitation levels
   was observed across the country during the study period. This increase
   is the result of an increase in extreme precipitation events in the
   region. On the other hand, two subregions, both located in the
   highlands, experienced a decline in precipitation levels. Since most of
   the reservoirs in Mauritius are located in these two subregions, this
   implies serious consequences for water availability in the country if
   existing storage capacities are kept.},

Title = {Characterizing Precipitation Variability and Trends in the World's
   Mediterranean-Climate Areas},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Mediterranean climate is principally characterized by warm, dry
   summers and cool, wet winters. However, there are large variations in
   precipitation dynamics in regions with this climate type. We examined
   the variability of precipitation within and among Mediterranean-climate
   areas, and classified the Mediterranean climate as wet, moderate, or dry
   based on annual precipitation; and strongly, moderately, or weakly
   seasonal based on percentage of precipitation during summer.
   Mediterranean biomes are mostly dry (<700 mm annually) but some areas
   are wet (>1300 mm annually); and many areas are weakly seasonal (>12\%
   of annual precipitation during summer). We also used NOAA NCDC climate
   records to characterize interannual variability of annual and dry-season
   precipitation, as well as trends in annual, winter, and dry-season
   precipitation for 337 sites that met the data quality criteria from 1975
   to 2015. Most significantly, sites in many Mediterranean-climate regions
   show downward trends in annual precipitation (southern California,
   Spain, Australia, Chile, and Northern Italy); and most of North America,
   the Mediterranean basin, and Chile showed downward trends in summer
   precipitation. Variations in annual and summer precipitation likely
   contribute to the high biodiversity and endemism characteristic of
   Mediterranean-climate biomes; the data indicate trends toward harsher
   conditions over the past 40 years.},

Abstract = {Many studies have reported on the trends of precipitation in Mid-Eastern
   China (EC). However, the trends of convective and stratiform
   precipitation are still unknown. Here, we examine the trends of summer
   convective and stratiform precipitation in EC from 2002 to 2012 on the
   basis of the TRMM observations. Results revealed that the rain frequency
   (RF) for both convective and stratiform precipitation increased in
   majority regions of Southern EC (SEC), but decreased in Northwest part
   of Northern EC (NEC). The decreasing rate of RF for stratiform
   precipitation in NEC is twice as much as that for convective
   precipitation, while the increase of convective precipitation in SEC is
   more evident than stratiform precipitation. The rain rate (RR) exhibited
   a decreasing trend in most portions of EC for both convective and
   stratiform precipitation. In SEC, neither PW nor WVT has good ability in
   explaining the precipitation variability. However, in NEC, PW is closely
   correlated to convective RF and WVT is more closely related to
   stratiform RF.},

Abstract = {Austral summer rainfall trends are analysed over South America from
   observations and simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project version 5 between 1902 and 2005. Positive trends in southeastern
   South America (SESA) and negative ones in the southern Andes (SAn) are
   the most significant observed features. Mean trends obtained from an
   ensemble of 59 simulations from 14 models for the historical experiment
   (including both natural and anthropogenic forcings) are able to
   reproduce those precipitation changes, although weaker than observed.
   Most of the simulations reproduce the right sign of the precipitation
   changes at both regions. However, associated uncertainty ranges (due to
   both inter-model dispersion and internal climate variability) are still
   large. Mean trends for the historical experiment are statistically
   distinguishable from those obtained for the natural-forcing-only
   experiment, which exhibit negligible mean values at both regions.
   Results allow concluding that the anthropogenic forcing has at least a
   partial contribution in explaining the precipitation changes observed in
   both SESA and SAn regions during the last century.},

Abstract = {This study aims to perform a comprehensive trend analysis of
   precipitation and streamflow at the watershed scale. Multiple techniques
   were employed to examine the temporal trends in annual, seasonal, and
   monthly precipitation as well as streamflow in the Xiangxi River
   watershed, China. Results showed that heterogeneous trends existed in
   precipitation and streamflow. To be specific, statistically
   insignificant trends in annual and seasonal precipitation were
   discovered, but varying monthly precipitation exhibited complex changes,
   especially for the decreasing precipitation in September. Annual and
   autumn average streamflow in addition to monthly streamflow in April,
   May, September, October, and November were found to experience a
   downward trend. Also, negative trends were detected in all low flow
   statistics, including annual minimum instantaneous streamflow; Q10, Q30,
   monthly, seasonal-minimum, and annual-minimum daily-mean streamflow; and
   7-, 14-, and 30-day consecutive minimum streamflow. For high flow
   statistics, monthly maximum streamflow showed a slight upward tendency
   in dry months (December, January, and February), while its values in
   April, May, September, and October indicated a decreasing trend. In
   addition, Q70 and Q90 were found to have a statistically significant
   negative trend. Sequential Mann-Kendall (MK) test revealed an earlier
   beginning of the trends in low flow statistics than the other stream
   flows. Change point analysis suggested that changes in streamflow
   statistics had occurred since 1989, and accordingly, a new relation
   between precipitation and streamflow was established after 1988.
   Anthropogenic activities, especially small hydropower development, were
   found to be mainly responsible for changes in streamflow regime during
   the last 50 years. Thus, the obtained findings would help to better
   implement hydrologic engineering design and water resources planning and
   management over the watershed under changing environment.},

Abstract = {Monotonic trends in hydrogen (H+), sulfate (SO4-2) and nitrate (NO3-)
   were calculated using non-parametric techniques at four Canadian Air and
   Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) sites and six nearby river
   systems in Atlantic Canada for the period 1983-1991. Over the whole
   interval, there were increasing nitrate concentrations and deposition
   trends at three of the four monitoring sites and no trends in SO4-2 or
   H+ concentrations and deposition. We found that SO42+ concentrations
   increased at three of our six river sites, NO3- increased at one site
   and H+ decreased at one site. River exports showed no trends in the
   entire study interval. The series were also analyzed in five year time
   windows, incremented by six months, to see if changes in trend presence
   or direction would occur, compared to trend analysis over the entire
   interval. We show that while trends in river chemistry do not contradict
   deposition patterns, the changes that occurred were not necessarily in
   step. We also found that the trends which we measured were the result of
   short-term changes as opposed to long-term continuous monotonic trends.
   The time lag between precipitation and chemistry trend changes seemed
   longer in basins dominated by softwoods than by hardwoods.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Annual and seasonal precipitation data for 49 meteorological stations
   over the period of 1960-2006 in Liaoning province were analyzed.
   Liaoning experienced province-wide decreases in precipitation over the
   47-year period, with annual precipitation decreasing by 96\% of the
   stations, followed by 92, 84, 63, and 27\%, respectively, for summer,
   autumn, spring, and winter precipitation. Regional trend analysis
   confirmed the province-wide decrease, which was detected by the
   site-specific analysis, but a greater number of significant declines
   were found for annual, summer, and autumn precipitation for Liaoning
   province and for three of its four subregions. Four significant cycles
   with alternation patterns were detected mainly at the time scales of
   3-5, 10-11, 20-23, and 31.2 years for each of the four subregions
   (Liaodong Peninsula, NortheasternMountain, Western Highland, and Central
   Plain) and the entire Liaoning province, with the dominant periodicities
   being 10-11 years. The 10-11-year periodic variation of Liaoning annual
   precipitation was negatively associated with sunspot activity and
   positively associatedwith the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) at the
   same time scale, while the 31.2-year periodic variation of Liaoning
   annual precipitation was positively correlated with both the EASM and
   ENSO activities at the 30-33-year time scale.},

Abstract = {This study calculated the annual and inter-annual variations in the
   precipitation recycling ratio (PRR) on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau (QXP);
   and by using water mass balance equation; we evaluated the estimated
   evaporation in the area. The results indicate that the estimated
   evaporation relate strongly to surface air temperature, relative
   humidity and wind speed. As temperatures on the QXP increase, the
   changes of PRR vary by regions within the plateau. Between 1979 and
   2008, the PRR decreased in the western QXP, which is an arid area, but
   it increased in the other areas. The strongest increasing PRR trend is
   3.1\%/10 a in the northeastern QXP, but a decreasing trend, ranging
   downward to -2.5\%/10 a, was observed in the western QXP. There is a
   significant seasonal change in precipitation recycling (PR) over QXP.
   The PR peak values occurred in July in all regions, and PR was very low
   (approaching 0.0) in winter half-year period. The monthly maximum PRR
   reached 0.62, which occurred in July over the southeastern QXP, where is
   a rich center of precipitation. These results imply that there is
   remarkable change of moisture resource of precipitation in last decades.
   On the QXP, large-scale moisture advances decrease with increased
   temperature, and the local moisture cycle is reinforced in wet regions.

Title = {Recent trends in selected extreme precipitation indices in Senegal - A
   changepoint approach},

Abstract = {Precipitation regime is the number one factor in food productivity in
   the Sahel region. Recurrent droughts have caused several food crises in
   the region during the three last decades. The situation may not improve
   as a recent special IPCC report states that West Africa will likely
   experience longer and more intense droughts (IPCC, 2012) in the near
   future. As drought adversely affects food security, Sahelian
   decision-makers need to understand past and current trends in Sahelian
   precipitation to have some insight in what can be expected for the next
   five years. In this paper, time series of selected precipitation indices
   were calculated using 1950-2007 daily precipitation data from 31
   stations across Senegal and analyzed for changes in temporal trends
   using a Bayesian multiple change point detection procedure. The selected
   indices are the mean (M) and the standard deviation (SD) of
   precipitation, the frequency of wet days (precipitation using threshold
   of >= 1 mm, Prcpl), the maximum number of consecutive dry days
   (precipitation < 1 mm, CDD), the greatest maximum amount accumulated
   over the 3 day (R3d), the mean intensity per wet day (SDII) and the 90th
   percentile of daily rainfall (Prec90p). They were calculated and
   averaged over four different regions: the entire country (R0), the
   Southern Sahelian Region (R1), the Northern Sudanian Region (R2), and
   finally the Southern Sudanian Region (R3).The Bayesian change-point
   detection procedure detects whenever a trend in the data is inverted,
   from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. Results show that
   significant changes in trend were almost always consistent across
   Senegalese regions, with a few years' differences in the dates of
   occurrence of the changes. A decreasing trend followed by an increasing
   trend was found for M, SD, Prcpl, R3d, SDII and Prec90p. An increasing
   trend followed by a decreasing trend was observed for CDD in regions R0,
   R1 and R2, but not for R3 where the trend is increasing during the study
   period. Changes in Prec90p were not consistent across regions,
   presumably because it is very sensitive to noise in the data. Most
   changes at the national scale occurred in the 1980s, except for SDII for
   which the changes occurred in the 1970s. Prec90p displayed a trend
   change (from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend) in the
   mid-1990s. Modest to significant increases in SDII were observed for
   almost all regions while Prcpl was stable during the last two decades.
   These results suggest that the continuous rainfall deficit that was
   observed since 1950 in this part of the Sahel has (at least temporarily)
   come to an end and that the next few years will be wet. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {This paper examines drought trends in Turkey due to climate change.
   Therefore, forecasting of periods of drought, which is one of the major
   negative side effects of climate change, is urgent. The authors use data
   on drought indicators according to the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
   and Evapotranspiration Index) for the period from 1901 to 2015 obtained
   at intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The data have been processed by
   several statistical tests: the Mann-Kendall test to determine the
   direction and significance of the trend, the Theil-Sen estimator to
   assess the trend slope coefficient, and the Pettitt test to determine
   the most probable year of change. The period under study is divided into
   two intervals (1901-1981 and 1982-2015), which are compared. The GIS
   program is used to isolate spatial characteristics from the results we
   obtained. It is concluded that Turkey is divided into two main zones of
   drought trends. The largest one allocated to the northern regions is
   characterized by an increase in moisture, and a decrease in moisture is
   observed in the southern regions. The trend towards dry periods was more
   significant until 1981, but the situation has changed since 1981 due to
   the trend towards excess moisture, except for southeastern Turkey, where
   a trend towards droughts persists.},

Abstract = {The spatiotemporal analysis of a region's precipitation climate regime
   could be particularly interesting for many fields of applied sciences,
   such as climatology, hydrology and water resources management. In this
   study, the precipitation trends at seasonal and annual scale, over a

   globally gridded precipitation data sets of monthly observations. In
   particular, among the several data sets available in literature, with
   spatial resolutions of 0.5 degrees longitude/latitude, in this work the
   Global Precipitation Climatology Centre Full Data Reanalysis Version 6
   data set has been used. The broad extension of the area under
   investigation allowed a better understanding of trend precipitation
   patterns over space. In fact, yearly results evidenced a marked negative
   rainfall tendency in the eastern Mediterranean (more than -20 mm/10
   years) and in North Africa (until -16 mm/10 years), while a relatively
   large positive trend (more than 20 mm/10 years) in central and northern
   Europe has been observed.},

Abstract = {Many studies have reported that total precipitation is increasing across
   the United States with most of the increase resulting from a positive
   trend in the upper tail of the daily precipitation distribution. Other
   studies have found that low and moderate, but not high flows are also
   increasing across much of the United States. How can precipitation,
   especially that produced by intense events, increase without a
   corresponding increase in high flows? We analyzed trends in annual 7-day
   low, average and high flows along with seasonal precipitation that is
   averaged over individual basins. Our findings suggest that statistically
   significant trends in both fall precipitation and 7-day low flow are
   found in a large percentage of the basins in the upper Mississippi and
   Great Lakes regions of the country. A large fraction of the trends in
   annual precipitation can be explained by an increase in fall
   precipitation. By estimating trends in precipitation at the spatial
   scale of individual basins, we offer a simple explanation for the
   apparent paradox of lack of trends in high flows. At the spatial scale
   of individual basins, precipitation is increasing during the fall but
   not during the spring, the season when high flows are generally
   observed. The increase in fall precipitation appears to result in an
   increase in the low flows while the lack of trends in precipitation in
   spring explains the lack of widespread trends in the high flows.},

Abstract = {The United States Climate Division datasets ( CDD) may contain spurious
   precipitation trends, induced by the method in which climate divisional
   data are created. This study investigated how the redistribution of
   stations within a climate division has affected purported annual trends
   in precipitation. CDD were compared to USHCN data for the 15 climate
   divisions of New England. Results showed that trends in the datasets are
   not always the same. We conclude that changing mean latitude, longitude,
   and elevation of stations within a division through time can affect, and
   even induce, trends in the time series. Trends found here were mostly
   increasing through time, but rates of change differed dramatically in
   some cases. Two climate divisions did have opposing trends between
   datasets. It appears that other factors, such as distance from the coast
   and changing slope direction ( aspect) of stations, may also influence
   these trends. Citation: Keim, B. D., M. R. Fischer, and A. M. Wilson (

Abstract = {This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the influence of
   tropical cyclones on precipitation variations in Indochina, examining
   Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, while exploring their connection with
   evolving climatic variables. Covering a span of four decades (1979-2021)
   and integrating daily precipitation records with climatic datasets, the
   research elucidates tropical cyclone's contributions to the annual
   precipitation across distinct regions, revealing percentages of 27\%,
   16\%, and 6\% in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, respectively. Spatial
   distribution mapping highlights concentrated intensities in central
   Vietnam, central Laos, and southern Cambodia. Additionally, an upward
   trend in Vietnam's precipitation, as a representative measure of the
   entire region, is observed over the study duration, while its
   variability exhibits marginal correlations with inter-annual and
   decadal-scale climatic indices. The upward trend aligns with increased
   precipitable water over Indochina and open oceans, increased sea surface
   temperatures, reinforced atmospheric low-pressure systems, and
   intensified westerly wind patterns post-2000. These findings underscore
   the complex interplay between climate variables and Indochina's
   precipitation dynamics, suggesting implications for disaster management
   and strategies to adapt to climate change.},

Abstract = {Against the background of climate change, the global carbon and water
   cycle has undergone significant changes, and it is of great significance
   to explore the interrelationships of the carbon and water cycles in
   different regions to cope with future climate change. In this study,
   based on gross primary productivity (GPP) and precipitation (PRE) data,
   the precipitation use efficiency (PUE) of the Loess Plateau (LP) was
   calculated, and the Sen trend analysis and Mann-Kendall test were used
   to analyse the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of PUE, as
   well as the first-order difference method was used to derive the
   relative contributions to quantify the impact of vegetation growth and
   meteorological factors on PUE. The results show that (1) from 2001 to
   2018, the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation PUE exhibited an
   increasing trend from northwest to southeast. On the time scale, the
   multi-year average value of PUE was 1.17 gC m(-2) mm(-1), showing an
   overall upward trend. Among the different land cover types, paddy fields
   had the highest PUE level, and sparse grassland had the lowest; (2) LAI
   had the highest relative contribution to vegetation PUE, followed by
   temperature (Temp), net radiation of the ground surface (RN), specific
   humidity (Shum), and wind speed (WS). LAI contributes positively to
   88.9\% of the area. RN positively influences high-altitude areas, while
   Shum had a larger area with a negative contribution. The contribution of
   Temp increases from northwest to southeast, and WS has balanced positive
   and negative contributions; (3) LAI is the dominant factor for the
   spatial and temporal variation of PUE in the LP, and the size of the
   areas where different meteorological factors dominate the changes of PUE
   are as follows: WS > Shum>RN > Temp. At high altitudes, the dominant
   meteorological driver is WS, while at low altitudes, the dominant
   climate driver is Shum. This study is of guiding significance for the
   ecological restoration and management of the LP, and it can also provide
   a scientific basis for the improvement of ecosystems and the sustainable
   management of water resources in the context of global climate change.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMETRICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The assessment of long-term trends in environmental extremes is a
   challenging and important subject in the current discussion on global
   climate change. We propose a new approach for evaluating temporal trends
   and spatial homogeneity in extremes accounting also for spatial
   dependence. Based on exceedances over a space-time threshold, we provide
   estimators for a so-called scedasis function and the extreme value
   parameters. Two novel test statistics based on the scedasis function
   provide a way to assess space-time inhomogeneities. Finally, we propose
   a procedure to achieve stationarity in space and time and evaluate
   residual extremal dependence over space through a variogram analysis
   that includes anisotropy. The methods are applied to daily accumulated
   precipitation data observed at 64 weather stations in North-Western
   Germany. The time period from 1931 to 2014 is considered, separately for
   northern hemispheric winter (November - March) and summer (May -
   September). The results reveal a clear seasonal differentiation on
   extremal behavior with the highest precipitation records and generally
   heavier tails during summer. Spatial inhomogeneities in the frequency of
   precipitation extremes are related to topography and are particularly
   significant during winter. During this season, we further observe
   significant deviations from time-stationarity at a few stations, related
   to a period of a high frequency of extremes around 1992. Spatial
   anisotropy in the extremal dependence structure is stronger during
   winter than during summer and reveals an increased dependence in the
   east-west direction.},

Title = {Long-term trends and variability of total and extreme precipitation in
   Thailand},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Based on quality-controlled daily station data, long-term trends and
   variability of total and extreme precipitation indices during 1955-2014
   were examined for Thailand. An analysis showed that while precipitation
   events have been less frequent across most of Thailand, they have become
   more intense. Moreover, the indices measuring the magnitude of intense
   precipitation events indicate a trend toward wetter conditions, with
   heavy precipitation contributing a greater fraction to annual totals.
   One consequence of this change is the increased frequency and severity
   of flash floods as recently evidenced in many parts of Thailand. On
   interannual-to-interdecadal time scales, significant relationships
   between variability of precipitation indices and the indices for the
   state of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO) were found. These results provide additional evidence
   that large-scale climate phenomena in the Pacific Ocean are remote
   drivers of variability in Thailand's total and extreme precipitation.
   Thailand tended to have greater amounts of precipitation and more
   extreme events during La Nina years and the PDO cool phase, and vice
   versa during El Nino years and the PDO warm phase. Another noteworthy
   finding is that in 2011 Thailand experienced extensive flooding in a
   year characterized by exceptionally extreme precipitation events. Our
   results are consistent with the regional studies for the Asia-Pacific
   Network. However, this study provides a more detailed picture of
   coherent trends at a station scale and documents changes that have
   occurred in the twenty-first century, both of which help to inform
   decisions concerning effective management strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {Recent studies on changes in precipitation intensity have found for some
   areas evidence of an increase in the proportion of total precipitation
   contributed by heavy and extreme rainfall events in the last 80 years.
   The purpose of the paper is to verify whether such a signal can also be
   detected in Northern Italy where daily precipitation (DP) is available
   starting from the beginning of the 19' century. The analysis is
   performed on 5 stations: Genoa (1833-1998). Milan(1858-1998), Mantova
   (1868-1997), Bologna (1879-1998) and Ferrara (1879-1996). It gives
   evidence that in Northern Italy there is a positive trend in the
   proportion of total precipitation contributed by heavy precipitation
   events (i.e. DP > 25 mm and DP > 50 mm). The trend is mainly caused by
   the last 60-80 years and is particularly evident in the periods
   1930-1960 and 1975-1995. It is more evident in the western than in the
   eastern area.},

Title = {Recent precipitation trends in Peninsular Spain and implications for
   water infrastructure design},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {45},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Study region: Peninsular Spain.Study focus: There is strong evidence
   that climate change has produced a decrease in precipitation combined
   with an increased frequency, intensity and magnitude of high-intensity
   storm events in Peninsular Spain. Such events have been particularly
   recurrent on the Spanish Mediterranean coast in recent years. This
   study's first objective is to update the trends in the magnitude and
   seasonality of precipitation in Spain from 1951 to 2019 at different
   time scales. Secondly, we analyse how extreme precipitation events
   recorded in recent years can modify water infrastruc-ture design flows.
   A QGIS plugin was programmed using Python to calculate the design flows
   in accordance with the methodologies legally established in Spain.New
   hydrological insights for the region: The results confirm the decreasing
   trend in annual pre-cipitation in most of the Spanish territory. This
   decrease was particularly significant during March and June. Moreover,
   the average increases of around 30-40 \% in design flows, which reached
   double the values obtained in the reference period of 1951-1990 in some
   basins, confirm the relevance of incorporating high-intensity storm
   events recorded in recent years into flow calcu-lations in Peninsular
   Spain. Design flows obtained without using the most recent rainfall data
   can be underestimated, with profound risk implications. Therefore, there
   is a sufficient technical basis to draw attention to this problem and
   recommend its formal consideration by competent authorities.},

Abstract = {The presence of autocorrelation and long-term persistence (LTP) can lead
   to considerable change in the significance of trends in hydro-climatic
   time series. This therefore casts doubt on past findings of climatic
   trend studies that did not consider LTP. We assessed the trends in
   spatiotemporal patterns of annual and seasonal precipitation of Pakistan
   in recent years (1961-2010) using precipitation data from the Global
   Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) using (1) the ordinary
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test and (2) the modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test,
   which can discriminate LTP from unidirectional trends. The results
   indicate that significance in trends obtained using the MK test is
   reduced when LTP is taken into consideration. The annual precipitation
   in Pakistan is increasing in the northern highlands and a few places in
   the sub-Himalayan ranges in northeast Pakistan, where monsoon
   precipitation is also increasing. There is no indication of significant
   change in winter precipitation. Post-monsoon precipitation is in
   creasing at a few locations in the monsoon-dominated southeast region
   and decreasing in the southwestern arid region.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},

Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {The study examines trends in characteristics of convective and
   stratiform precipitation in the Czech Republic over 1982-2010. The
   spatially averaged trends in convective precipitation are rising for
   indices of mean precipitation, and the increases are significant in all
   seasons except for winter. For extremes, the trends are spatially much
   more variable and insignificant, but increases tend to prevail as well.
   The trends in convective precipitation are larger in the western part of
   the country where Atlantic influences are stronger. For characteristics
   of stratiform precipitation, the trends are usually smaller compared to
   those of convective precipitation, but increases prevail too. They are
   significant in autumn, especially for extremes, and larger in the
   eastern part of the country where Mediterranean cyclones play more
   important role. The trends in convective precipitation tend to be more
   pronounced at lowland than higher-elevated stations while an opposite
   pattern prevails for stratiform precipitation. The results suggest that
   in spring and summer, when convective precipitation represents an
   important fraction of the total amounts in central Europe (around 30\%
   and 50\%, respectively), the observed increases in total precipitation
   are mainly due to increases in convective precipitation. In autumn,
   increases in both convective and stratiform precipitation are important,
   and the trends are weakest and least pronounced in winter.},

Abstract = {Wet deposition monitoring was conducted at six rural stations in western
   Japan, during the period from 1987 through 1996. Long-term trends in the
   concentration of non-sea salt ions were analyzed on the basis of the
   data obtained. The monitoring results indicated that annual average
   concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ in precipitation significantly increased
   on the order of 45\%, and that of nss-Ca2+ and nSS-SO42-, concentrations
   did not change over the past 10 years. The ratio of NO3-/nss-SO42- in
   precipitation significantly increased, the ratio of NO3-/NH4+ showed no
   marked fluctuations, and the ratio of
   {[}nss-Ca2++NH4+]/{[}nss-SO42-+NO3-] slightly increased during the
   period. These findings suggested that the wet deposition of NO3- and
   NH4+ in western Japan, particularly that in the winter season, was
   influenced by the long-range transport of nitrogen oxides and ammonia
   from the Asian continent.},

Abstract = {Since 1984, wet precipitation samples have been collected from five
   sampling sites in the eastern Alpine region of Austria. The chemical
   analysis performed included pH, NH4+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, NO3-,
   SO42- and precipitation amount. These data were used to determine the 10
   years (1984-1993) trends in precipitation chemistry and deposition for
   all major ions. The statistical data treatment by the use of
   least-squares linear regression revealed a significant decrease of
   sulfate and hydrogen ion concentrations and depositions at all sites in
   consideration (above 65\% for hydrogen ion and over 33\% for sulfate
   concentration and 40\% for hydrogen and 36\% for sulfate deposition). An
   effort is made to explain the acidity decrease not only by the parallel
   decrease of sulfate concentration but by the participation of the other
   constituents of the wet precipitation events. It has been found that
   when the hydrogen ion concentration decrease is stronger than that of
   sulfate ion concentrations a compensation mainly by ammonium ion
   concentration increase is achieved. On the contrary, when the hydrogen
   ion concentration decrease is weaker than sulfate concentration
   decrease, a calcium ion concentration decrease is present for the sites
   in consideration. The results obtained indicate that the precipitation
   chemistry in Central Austria follows the global trends of controlled
   reduction of atmospheric acidity. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Abstract = {The present study investigates the century-long and more recent rainfall
   trends over the greater region of Middle East and North Africa (MENA).
   Five up-to-date gridded observational datasets are employed. Besides
   mean annual values, trends of six indices of drought and extreme
   precipitation are also considered in the analysis. Most important
   findings include the significant negative trends over the Maghreb,
   Levant, Arabian Peninsula, and Sahel regions that are evident since the
   beginning of the twentieth century and are more or less extended to
   today. On the other hand, for some Mediterranean regions such as the
   Balkans and the Anatolian Plateau, precipitation records during the most
   recent decades indicate a significant increasing trend and a recovering
   from the dry conditions that occurred during the mid-1970s and
   mid-1980s. The fact that over parts of the study region the selected
   datasets were found to have substantial differences in terms of mean
   climate, trends, and interannual variability, motivated the more
   thorough investigation of the precipitation observational uncertainty.
   Several aspects, such as annual and monthly mean climatologies and also
   discrepancies in the monthly time-series distribution, are discussed
   using common methods in the field of climatology but also more
   sophisticated, nonparametric approaches such as the Kruskal-Wallis and
   Dunn's tests. Results indicate that in the best case, the data sources
   are found to have statistically significant differences in the
   distribution of monthly precipitation for about 50\% of the study region
   extent. This percentage is increased up to 70\% when particular datasets
   are compared. Indicatively, the range between the tested rainfall
   datasets is found to be more than 20\% of their mean annual values for
   most of the extent of MENA, while locally, for the hyper-arid regions,
   this percentage is increased up to 100\%. Precipitation observational
   uncertainty is also profound for parts of southern Europe. Outlier
   datasets over individual regions are identified in order to be more
   cautiously used in future regional climate studies.},

Abstract = {Clear precipitation trends have been observed in Europe over the past
   century. In winter, precipitation has increased in north-western Europe.
   In summer, there has been an increase along many coasts in the same
   area. Over the second half of the past century precipitation also
   decreased in southern Europe in winter. An investigation of
   precipitation trends in two multi-model ensembles including both global
   and regional climate models shows that these models fail to reproduce
   the observed trends. In many regions the model spread does not cover the
   trend in the observations. In contrast, regional climate model (RCM)
   experiments with observed boundary conditions reproduce the observed
   precipitation trends much better. The observed trends are largely
   compatible with the range of uncertainties spanned by the ensemble,
   indicating that the boundary conditions of RCMs are responsible for
   large parts of the trend biases. We find that the main factor in setting
   the trend in winter is atmospheric circulation, for summer sea surface
   temperature (SST) is important in setting precipitation trends along the
   North Sea and Atlantic coasts. The causes of the large trends in
   atmospheric circulation and summer SST are not known. For SST there may
   be a connection with the well-known ocean circulation biases in
   low-resolution ocean models. A quantitative understanding of the causes
   of these trends is needed so that climate model based projections of
   future climate can be corrected for these precipitation trend biases.},

Abstract = {Precipitation acidification, often termed as acid rain (pH < 5.6), has
   been recognized as one of the major environmental issues in China since
   the 1980s and exerted detrimental effects on terrestrial ecosystems. In
   this study, we present the first investigation on the evolution of
   precipitation acidification over China during 2006-2015 based on a
   long-term nationwide precipitation observation network and chemical
   transport model (Weather Research and Forest model coupled with
   Chemistry) simulations. The observations demonstrate a clearly
   decreasing trend in precipitation acidification across China from 2006
   to 2015. The percentages of the number of the stations experiencing
   heavy acidic precipitation (annual mean pH < 5.0) decrease from similar
   to 50\% in 2006 to 20\% in 2015, and those with pH < 4.5 decrease from
   25\% to less than 5\%. Our model simulations reproduced this trend and
   show the notable decrease in the terrestrial area (from 30\% to 16\%)
   experiencing the mean precipitation pH < 5.6. The simulation experiments
   indicate that the mitigation of the acidification issue in China stemmed
   from the large reduction in SO2 emissions (by about 60\% from 2006 to
   2015), which would limit the formation of sulfate and also increase the
   wet scavenging of gaseous ammonia. The contributions of sulfuric acid on
   precipitation acidification were estimated to decrease from 0.70-0.82 to
   0.44-0.60 from 2006 to 2015 over northern, southern, and southwestern
   China. This study suggests that nitric acid plays a more important role
   in acidifying precipitation in northern China at present, while sulfuric
   acid is still the dominant factor in southern areas.},

Abstract = {Precipitation is considered to be a very important climatic element for
   the plain areas in Romania. Thus, variation in precipitation data ranges
   is more and more studied. In this paper total amounts of precipitation
   and the depth of the snow cover were analyzed. Annual, seasonal and
   monthly data were used to identify the general trends in the amount of
   precipitation for a period of 41 years (1965-2005) in 5 weather stations
   from the central part of Romanian Plain: Alexandria, Pitesti, Rosiorii
   de Vede, Turnu Magurele and Videle. They are located in different areas:
   on the high plain in the North of the region, in the central area and on
   the Danube River banks. For snow cover only winter months series were
   analyzed. To detect and estimate trends in the time series, Mann-Kendall
   test for trend and Sen's slope estimates were used while for
   fluctuations in precipitations WASP cumulated curve was analyzed. Main
   conclusions that can be mentioned are: decreasing trends in total
   amounts of precipitation, especially for summer months and for annual
   values, but also with fluctuations that had upward trends in the first
   part of the analyzed period and than decreasing trends beginning with
   October 1981; increasing trends of the snow cover during winter months.},

Abstract = {In this study, it was attempted to interpret the trends in annual
   precipitation totals and annual mean stream-flow records in Gediz basin
   located in Western Turkey. The data used consisted of 1966-1998 records
   of 14 precipitation and 4 stream-flow gauging stations. The trend
   analysis was performed by applying sequential versions of non-parametric
   statistical Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests. The results showed a
   decreasing tendency for annual precipitation with change points in the
   beginning of the 1980s and similar downward trends for stream-flow
   records with change points concentrated around the mid-1980s. This trend
   of stream-flow pattern in the basin could be directly explained by
   precipitation decrease during the same period. All the trends of
   hydro-climatic variables were entirely consistent with those identified
   in recent studies carried out in Turkey and several southern
   Mediterranean countries.},

   surface water sites, only increasing or stable SO42- trends were
   observed, and these had both concomitant increasing and decreasing
   trends for pH and (or) acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC). Despite a
   considerable number of lakes showing decreasing SO42- trends in Quebec,
   pH and ANC also decreased. Quebec was also the only region showing
   extensive evidence of increasing NO3-. The opposite situation was
   observed in Atlantic Canada lakes where despite increasing SO42-, the
   dominant trend observed for pH and ANC was increasing. Trends observed
   for pH and ANC were used to classify the acidification status of our
   surface water sites: 60 of the 111 sites were found to be stable (i.e.,
   showing no trends), 17 were continuing to acidify, and 34 were

Abstract = {Climatic events are often caused by extreme meteorological conditions.
   Therefore, analyzing the changes trend in the mean or median data does
   not provide considerable information and it is necessary to examine it
   in different parts of the data distribution. Quantile regression method
   is able to study the trend in different quantiles of climatic
   parameters. In this study, the seasonal changes trend was analyzed using
   the quantile regression method in different amounts of daily
   precipitation for different at Gorgan, Babolsar and Anzali stations
   located in northern Iran. First, the statistical period of 62 years
   (1959-2020) was used to study the trend and then this given reach was
   divided into two statistical periods of 31 years (1(1959-1989) and
   2(1990-2020)) and then Quantile regression was performed for different
   quantiles of daily precipitation for all three statistical periods. The
   results show different trend patterns for each quantile of seasons.
   Increasing trends have often been related to the extreme upper quantile
   of precipitation (the quantile 0.99), which indicates an increase in
   extreme rainfall and flood events. The slopes of increasing and
   decreasing trend have been changed in different time periods and also
   extreme precipitation have increased in winter in recent decades. The
   trend of precipitation slopes in semi-humid areas (Gorgan station) and
   in humid parts (Anzali station) were exposed more than temperate in
   period 2 and period 1, respectively. In conclusion, the highest
   increasing trends of precipitation were observed in autumn and winter
   and the highest decreasing trends were observed in spring and summer.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the annual climate trend of precipitation and its
   non-potable use in a university campus in the Brazilian Western Amazon.
   We used pluviometric data gathered between 1960 and 2013, and, for the
   harnessing of water, we considered the roof of buildings in the Federal
   University of Acre -Campus Floresta, located in Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre.
   We calculated the monthly average of precipitation and the probability
   of its occurrence: 75\%, 85\% and 95\%. We detected a slightly positive
   tendency in the pluviometric data when applying the Mann-Kendall test.
   We also applied the Pettitt test, however, it did not provide meaningful
   results for this series of precipitation. We verified a meaningful
   reduction in precipitation during the rainy season in the Amazon. The
   dry season showed a reduction in the length of its driest period, which
   indicates a change in the patterns and seasonality of precipitation in
   the region. Using the monthly rainfall can secure between 96.45\% and
   70.89\% of the Campus water demand. The water surplus propitiated by the
   average precipitation thus probably guarantees between 75\% and 85\% of
   the water needs in Floresta Campus. Securing 95\% of the demand requires
   complementation from August through to November or even December.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {110},

Abstract = {{[}1] We examined the spatial and temporal variation in precipitation
   observed daily at 272 weather stations operated by the China
   Meteorological Administration from 1960 to 2000. We found that
   precipitation in China increased by 2\% over that period, while the
   frequency of precipitation events decreased by 10\%. Seasonally,
   precipitation increased in winter and summer but decreased in spring and
   fall. Regional differences also appeared: Precipitation decreased in the
   North China Plain and north central China, showed almost no change in
   southwest China, and increased in China's five other climatic regions.
   Only the increase in northwest China, however, was statistically
   significant ( p = 0.05). For China as a whole and its eight climatic
   regions these changes in precipitation can be attributed mostly to
   changes in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events.
   Nationwide, the increased frequency of heavy precipitation events
   contributed 95\% of the total increase of precipitation in that
   category. At the same time, there were fewer light precipitation events,
   accounting for 66\% of the national reduction in precipitation
   frequency. In seven of the eight climatic regions, changes in frequency
   accounted for most of the changes in the amounts of precipitation from
   heavy precipitation events; changing intensity accounted for a larger
   share in the southwestern region. The frequency of precipitation has
   decreased in all seasons and all regions except northwest China. The
   increasing proportion of precipitation delivered by heavy rainfall
   events and the decreasing trend of light precipitation events have
   potentially serious ramifications for flood control and vegetation
   production, especially for the non-irrigated croplands in the arid and
   semiarid areas of China.},

   trends in the Pacific corroborates previous results based on satellite
   measurements, estimates of oceanic evaporation from shipboard

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Precipitation extremes have been investigated throughout the last
   decades in different regions of the Andes. However, little attention has
   been paid to the Altiplano region (Central Andes), especially to the
   Peruvian Altiplano (PA) that represents a complex area and is highly
   vulnerable to extreme events, such as floods and droughts, driven by the
   strong variability of precipitation. This study focuses on the analysis
   of 11 extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) in the period 1971-2013. In
   this context, commonly used statistical trend and break analyses were
   applied and a false discovery procedure was used in order to reduce the
   number of artificial significant tests. Additionally, the relative
   dominance of precipitation frequency and intensity in interannual
   precipitation datasets was determined. Finally, the correlation between
   EPIs and six oceanic-atmospheric indices were analysed. The results
   indicate that there is no significant global trend towards wet or dry
   conditions in the PA, although a signal of a more slightly decrease of
   precipitation is presented in the Southern PA. Additionally, interannual
   variability of total precipitation is mainly dominated by precipitation
   frequency. The Central Tropical Pacific sea surface temperature plays a
   major role for the maximum and average length of wet periods as well as
   for total precipitation. This finding is particularly relevant for the
   southwestern PA. Our results have important implications for risk
   management and adaptation planning related to extreme hydrological
   events in the PA.},

Title = {Frequency analysis, infilling and trends for extreme precipitation for

Abstract = {Study region: The island of Jamaica.
   Study Focus: Existing intensity duration frequency (IDF) curves for
   Jamaica were calculated over 20 years ago for two stations using an
   annual maxima series (AMS) that is 30 years long. The goodness of fit
   for the IDF curves is no longer available, and trends have not been
   accounted for in the series. Data recovery efforts undertaken in this
   study facilitate a re-examination and comparison of the existing IDF
   curves with new curves derived from an extended AMS from 1895 to 2010.
   In extending the data, gaps in the short durations (5 min to 12 h) AMS
   were filled using an empirical formula and gaps in the long durations
   (2-10 days) were filled by artificial neural network (ANN) downscaling.
   Analysis included an examination of frequency analysis configuration for
   varying probability distribution functions (PDF), plotting point
   functions (PPF) and parameter estimation methods (PEM). The study
   determines PDF as the most important factor in the configuration of the
   frequency analysis. Infilling and extension are also shown to reduce the
   biases, improve the frequency analysis and yield higher predicted
   intensities.
   New hydrological insights for the region: Temporal trends in
   location,scale and shape parameters for each station were also examined
   and lin-early projected to 2100. Increases in 2100 intensities vary from
   27\% to 59\%for the 100 years return period (RP) as a result of
   increases in the variability. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Year = {1998},
Volume = {79},
Number = {2},
Pages = {231-241},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Twentieth century trends of precipitation are examined by a variety of
   methods to more fully describe how precipitation has changed or varied.
   Since 1910, precipitation has increased by about 10\% across the
   contiguous United States. The increase in precipitation is reflected
   primarily in the heavy and extreme daily precipitation events. For
   example, over half (53\%) of the total increase of precipitation is due
   to positive trends in the upper 10 percentiles of the precipitation
   distribution. These trends are highly significant, both practically and
   statistically. The increase has arisen for two reasons. First, an
   increase in the frequency of days with precipitation {[}6 days (100
   yr)(-1)] has occurred for all categories of precipitation amount.
   Second, for the extremely heavy precipitation events, an increase in the
   intensity of the events is also significantly contributing (about half)
   to the precipitation increase. As a result, there is a significant trend
   in much of the United States of the highest daily year-month
   precipitation amount, but with no systematic national trend of the
   median precipitation amount.
   These data suggest that the precipitation regimes in the United States
   are changing disproportionately across the precipitation distribution.
   The proportion of total precipitation derived from extreme and heavy
   events is increasing relative to more moderate events. These changes
   have an impact on the area of the United States affected by a much
   above-normal (upper 10 percentile) proportion of precipitation derived
   from very heavy precipitation events, for example, daily precipitation
   events exceeding 50.8 mm (2 in.).},

Title = {Climatic Trends in Hail Precipitation in France: Spatial, Altitudinal,
   and Temporal Variability},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Abstract = {Hail precipitation is characterized by enhanced spatial and temporal
   variability. Association Nationale d'Etude et de Lutte contre les Fleaux
   Atmospheriques (ANELFA) installed hailpad networks in the Atlantic and
   Midi-Pyrenees regions of France. Historical data of hail variables from
   1990 to 2010 were used to characterize variability. A total of 443
   stations with continuous records were chosen to obtain a first
   approximation of areas most affected by hail. The Cressman method was
   selected for this purpose. It was possible to find relationships between
   spatial distributions of the variables, which are supported by obtained
   Pearson correlations. Monthly and annual trends were examined using the
   Mann-Kendall test for each of the total affected hailpads. There were
   154 pads with a positive trend; most were located between Tarbes and
   Saint-Gaudens. We found 177 pads with a negative trend, which were
   largely south of a pine forest in Landes. The remainder of the study
   area showed an elevated spatial variability with no pattern, even
   between relatively close hailpads. A similar pattern was found in Lerida
   (Spain) and Southeast France. In the entire area, monthly trends were
   predominantly negative in June, July, and August, whereas May had a
   positive trend; again, however, there was no spatial pattern. There was
   a high concentration of hailpads with positive trend near the Pyrenees,
   probably owing to orographic effects, and if we apply cluster analysis
   with the Mann-Kendall values, the spatial variability is accentuated for
   stations at higher altitude.},

   the U.K. no corresponding negative excSO42- trend is found from this
   transport direction. In airmasses from remote areas, like the Atlantic
   and Norwegian seas, a marked negative excSO42- trend is found, in
   accordance with reduced emission rates in middle Europe and North
   America. Further, increased emission rates of nitrogen compounds are
   reflected in a positive NO3- trend in southern Norway. The most
   northerly station indicates, however, a decrease in NO3-.},

Title = {Precipitation Trends and Flood Hazard Assessment in a Greek World

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Natural disasters have become more frequent and intense over the last
   decade mainly as a result of poor water and land management. Cultural
   sites and monuments are extremely vulnerable to natural disasters,
   particularly floods, while mitigation measures and protective
   infrastructure are difficult to construct within such areas. In the
   present study, the precipitation trends of the recent past and over the
   next 80 years were analyzed for the old town of Corfu (UNESCO World
   Heritage Site) in order to identify potentially significant changes that
   may affect the flood risk of the area. Moreover, a multi-criteria
   analysis using GIS software was used to identify high flood hazard zones
   in this living monument in order to propose specific mitigation measures
   that are in line with the characteristics of the site. The main effort
   in this study was to find a methodological approach for a fast but
   reliable assessment of future changes in the flood risk of historic
   monuments without the need for a hydrodynamic model and with a limited
   amount of locally based data. With the selected approach, a good
   indication of the potential changes in flood risk was provided,
   according to climate scenarios and simple, physically-based
   geostatistical models. The results indicate that no significant changes
   in the flood risk were found for the future climatic conditions, and the
   identified flood-prone areas will remain approximately the same as today
   in this particular historic monument. The uncertainty that is included
   in this output originates mainly from the inherent errors in climate
   modeling and from the non-high temporal resolution of the data.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the possibility of changes in daily scale solar
   radiation and precipitation variability. Coefficients of variation (CVs)
   were computed for the daily downward surface solar radiation product
   from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project and the daily
   precipitation product from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project.
   Regression analysis was used to identify trends in CVs. Statistically
   significant changes in solar radiation variability were found for 35\%
   of the globe, and particularly large increases were found for tropical
   Africa and the Maritime Continent. These increases in solar radiation
   variability were correlated with increases in precipitation variability
   and increases in deep convective cloud amount. The changes in
   high-frequency climate variability identified here have consequences for
   any process depending nonlinearly on climate, including solar energy
   production and terrestrial ecosystem photosynthesis. To assess these
   consequences, additional work is needed to understand how high-frequency
   climate variability will change in the coming decades.},

Title = {Variability of the precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains, Central

Abstract = {The annual precipitation over the Tianshan Mountains experienced an
   inter-decadal transition shift towards an increasing trend in the late
   1980s. This study conducts attribution analysis from atmospheric
   circulation factors based on the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre
   (GPCC) dataset and NCEP/NACR reanalysis data. The results show that (a)
   Winter precipitation in the Tianshan Mountains is affected by
   multi-decadal oscillations with periods of 26.8 and 44.7 years, and has
   entered a period of positive anomalies after 1988. Although the
   non-linear trend of winter precipitation in the Tianshan Mountains
   firstly increased and then decreased after 1979, the multi-decadal
   fluctuation of precipitation caused the Tianshan Mountains in winter to
   be in a wet period from the 1980s until 2011. (b) We find that the East
   Atlantic-West Russia (EATL/WRUS) teleconnection pattern has a similar
   multi-decadal variability as Tianshan precipitation in winter. The wet
   period of Tianshan in winter after 1988 is mainly due to the enhanced
   meridional feature of the EATL/WRUS triggering more water vapour flux
   from low-latitude oceanic areas. (c) Summer precipitation in the
   Tianshan Mountains has an obvious multi-decadal scale of 33.5 years and
   shows a non-linear growth trend. Tianshan Mountains in summer entered a
   humid period after 1986. (d) The Scandinavia (SCAND) teleconnection
   pattern represents important circulation variability affecting Tianshan
   summer precipitation. The vigorous high pressure over the Ural Mountains
   and the low pressure over Central Asia during the SCAND negative phase
   in summer jointly lead to enhanced moisture transport from the Arctic

Title = {Long-term trends in rainfall erosivity-analysis of high resolution
   precipitation time series (1937-2007) from Western Germany},

Abstract = {It is generally assumed that global warming will lead to a more dynamic
   atmosphere which potentially leads to more frequent high intensity
   rainfall events in many regions of the world. In consequence, an
   increase in local flash floods and soil erosion intensity would be
   expected. This study used one of the very rare long-term (1937-2007)
   high resolution (<= 5-min) data sets of ten stations in Central Europe
   to analyze long-term trends in summer rainfall erosivity. Furthermore
   potential changes in frequency and/or magnitude of individual erosive
   rainfall events, and shifts in seasonality of rainfall erosivity were
   investigated. The data were intensively tested for consistency and
   homogeneity and trends were analyzed using linear regressions as well as
   Mann-Kendall tests. For the period of 1937-2007, a slight, significant
   increase in summer erosivity (April-November) of 4.4\% per decade was
   observed. This linear trend is much steeper since the early seventies of
   the last century (1973-2007: an increase of 21.0\% per decade). For both
   periods, the linear trend was confirmed by positive and significant
   results of the Mann-Kendall test. The increasing trends in summer
   erosivity resulted from an increasing frequency of erosive events and an
   increase in magnitude, especially of the largest events. The proof of
   changes in seasonality is, for methodological reasons, less clear than
   the overall change in summer erosivity. However, there is a tendency
   that the period of erosive events was prolonged during the last decades
   of the observations with comparably higher erosivity between May and
   July and in October. Depending on adaption strategies of farmers, this
   changing temporal pattern in erosivity might lead to more pounced
   erosion events under row crops in spring, and after the harvest of small
   grains in late summer and autumn. In general, this shift in seasonality
   seemed to be more important for an increase in erosion potential than an
   overall slight increase in annual erosivity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {This study examines variations of maximum temperature, minimum
   temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) and their possible
   correlations to urbanisation in Xiamen, a coastal city in SE China. The
   underlying meteorological data used are the daily temperature time
   series from Xiamen Meteorological Station from 1954 to 2007. We selected
   four urbanisation indices, urban population, gross domestic product,
   built-up area and gross electricity consumption, to investigate
   correlations with temperature variables over the period 1981-2007. The
   results show that annual maximum temperature, minimum temperature and
   DTR increased from 1954 to 2007 at a rate of 0.33 degrees C/10 years,
   0.18 degrees C/10 years and 0.15 degrees C/10 years, respectively.
   Similarly, the seasonal maximum temperature, minimum temperature and DTR
   rose over the same period, with stronger increasing trends in winter and
   summer than in spring and autumn. The four selected urbanisation indices
   were all positively correlated with the three temperature variables,
   although more significantly with maximum and minimum temperatures than
   with DTR. The influence of urbanisation appears to be slightly stronger
   on maximum temperature than on minimum temperature in this area.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis and estimation of monthly and annual precipitation,
   reference evapotranspiration ETo, and rainfall deficit are essential for
   water-resources management and cropping-system design. Rainfall, ETo,
   and water-deficit patterns and trends at Macon in eastern Mississippi
   for a 120-yr period (1894-2014) were analyzed for annual, seasonal, and
   monthly periods. The analysis showed historical average annual rainfall,
   ETo, and dryness index (DI) in the location to be 1307 mm, 1210 mm, and
   0.97, respectively. Monthly rainfall and ETo ranged from 72 to 118 mm
   and from 94 to 146 mm, respectively, between May and October, resulting
   in a monthly rain deficit from 22 to 62 mm. Annual rainfall showed an
   increasing trend of 1.17 mm yr(-1) while annual ETo exhibited a
   decreasing trend of -0.51 mm yr(-1), resulting in an annual DI reduction
   of 0.001 per year. Seasonal trends were found for rainfall in autumn
   (1.06 mm yr (1)), ETo in summer (-0.29 mm yr (1)) and autumn (-0.18 mm
   yr(-1)), and DI in autumn (-0.006). An autoregressive, integrated, and
   moving-average (ARIMA) approach was used to model monthly and annual
   rainfall, ETo, and DI and to predict those values in the future. Low
   values of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error
   (with both statistics being normalized to the mean of the observed
   values), low values of average percent bias, and low values of the ratio
   of the RMSE to the standard deviation of observed data, along with
   values of 1.0 for Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency and the index of
   agreement, all suggest that the performance of the models is acceptable.
   The ARIMA models forecast 1319 mm of mean annual rainfall, 1203 mm of
   mean annual ETo, and 0.82 of mean annual DI from 2015 to 2024. The
   results obtained from this research can guide development of
   water-management practices and cropping systems in the area that rely on
   this weather station. The approaches used and the models fitted in this
   study can serve as a demonstration of how a time series trend can be
   analyzed and a model fitted at other locations.},

   help to make predictions about the rainfall patterns as well as
   addressing the issues of food-water-energy nexus. Herein, a trend
   analysis of rainfall was carried out in selected seven rainfall stations
   of Vaigai river basin in Tamil Nadu state, India. Statistical trend
   analysis was carried out, to observe the trend pattern for the period
   from 1959 to 2016. To determine the trend of rainfall, non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test and Spearman Rho tests were used. This investigation
   provides insights about precipitation trends during annual,
   post-monsoon, pre-monsoon periods. These findings will provide clues for
   developing efficient water management systems using different simulation

Abstract = {The concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic

   report here the geometric mean concentrations for each of these
   compounds for each year and at each site. Assuming a first-order rate
   decline for these data, we have calculated the time it takes for these
   concentrations to decrease by half. The halving times are not
   statistically distinguishable among the sites. Overall, the observed
   halving times are 11 2 years for the PCBs, 14 3 years for the PAHs, 4.0
   +/- 0.2 for the hexachlorocyclohexanes, 8.0 +/- 0.9 for the DDTs, 5.1
   +/- 0.8 for the chlordanes, and 8.4 +/- 0.6 for the endosulfans. In
   general, the halving times calculated from precipitation concentrations
   agree with those calculated from atmospheric vapor and particle phase
   concentrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Trends in projections of standardized precipitation indices in a future
   climate in Poland},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1947-1969},
Abstract = {Possible future climate change effects on dryness conditions in Poland
   are estimated for six climate projections using the standardized
   precipitation index (SPI). The time series of precipitation represent
   six different climate model runs under the selected emission scenario
   for the period 1971-2099. Monthly precipitation values were used to
   estimate the SPI for multiple timescales (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months)
   for a spatial resolution of 25 km for the whole country. Trends in the
   SPI were analysed using the Mann-Kendall test with Sen's slope estimator
   for each grid cell for each climate model projection and aggregation
   scale, and results obtained for uncorrected precipitation and bias
   corrected precipitation were compared. Bias correction was achieved
   using a distribution-based quantile mapping (QM) method in which the
   climate model precipitation series were adjusted relative to gridded
   precipitation data for Poland. The results show that the spatial pattern
   of the trend depends on the climate model, the timescale considered and
   on the bias correction. The effect of change on the projected trend due
   to bias correction is small compared to the variability among climate
   models. We also summarize the mechanisms underlying the influence of
   bias correction on trends in precipitation and the SPI using a simple
   example of a linear bias correction procedure. In both cases, the bias
   correction by QM does not change the direction of changes but can change
   the slope of trend, and the influence of bias correction on SPI is much
   reduced. We also have noticed that the results for the same global

   changes in Himalayan ponds},
Journal = {CRYOSPHERE},

Volume = {10},

Pages = {1433-1448},
Abstract = {Climatic time series for high-elevation Himalayan regions are decidedly
   scarce. Although glacier shrinkage is now sufficiently well described,
   the changes in precipitation and temperature at these elevations are
   less clear. This contribution shows that the surface area variations of
   unconnected glacial ponds, i.e. ponds not directly connected to glacier
   ice, but that may have a glacier located in their hydrological basin,
   can be considered as suitable proxies for detecting past changes in the
   main hydrological components of the water balance. On the south side of
   Mt Everest, glacier melt and precipitation have been found to be the
   main drivers of unconnected pond surface area changes (detected mainly
   with Landsat imagery). In general, unconnected ponds have decreased
   significantly by approximately 10 +/- 5aEuro-\% in terms of surface area
   over the last 50 years (1963-2013 period) in the study region. Here, an
   increase in precipitation occurred until the mid-1990s followed by a
   decrease until recent years. Until the 1990s, glacier melt was constant.
   An increase occurred in the early 2000s, while a declining trend in
   maximum temperature has caused a reduction in the glacier melt during
   recent years.},

Title = {Trends in indices of daily precipitation extremes in Catalonia (NE

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Pages = {3213-3226},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to quantitatively characterize the climatology
   of daily precipitation indices in Catalonia (northeastern Iberian
   Peninsula) from 1951 to 2003. This work has been performed analyzing a
   subset of the ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and
   Indices) precipitation indices calculated from a new interpolated
   dataset of daily precipitation, namely SPAIN02, regular at 0.2 degrees
   horizontal resolution (around 20 km) and from two high-quality stations:
   the Ebro and Fabra observatories.
   Using a jack-knife technique, we have found that the sampling error of
   the SPAIN02 regional averaged is relatively low. The trend analysis has
   been implemented using a Circular Block Bootstrap procedure applicable
   to non-normal distributions and autocorrelated series. A running trend
   analysis has been applied to analyze the trend persistence. No general
   trends at a regional scale are observed, considering the annual or the
   seasonal regional averaged series of all the indices for all the time
   windows considered. Only the consecutive dry days index (CDD) at annual
   scale shows a locally coherent spatial trend pattern; around 30\% of the
   Catalonia area has experienced an increase of around 2-3 days
   decade(-1). The Ebro and Fabra observatories show a similar CDD trend,
   mainly due to the summer contribution. Besides this, a significant
   decrease in total precipitation (around -10mmdecade(-1)) and in the
   index ``highest precipitation amount in five-day period{''} (RX5DAY,
   around -5mmdecade(-1)), have been found in summer for the Ebro
   observatory.},

Abstract = {Pronounced intermodel differences in the projected response of land
   surface precipitation (LSP) to future anthropogenic forcing remain in
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 model integrations. A
   large fraction of the intermodel spread in projected LSP trends is
   demonstrated here to be associated with systematic differences in
   simulated sea surface temperature (SST) trends, especially the
   representation of changes in (i) the interhemispheric SST gradient and
   (ii) the tropical Pacific SSTs. By contrast, intermodel differences in
   global mean SST, representative of differing global climate
   sensitivities, exert limited systematic influence on LSP patterns. These
   results highlight the importance to regional terrestrial precipitation
   changes of properly simulating the spatial distribution of large-scale,
   remote changes as reflected in the SST response to increasing greenhouse
   gases. Moreover, they provide guidance regarding which region-specific
   precipitation projections may be potentially better constrained for use
   in climate change impact assessments.},

Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Pages = {2285-2298},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Combinations of statistical analyses including principal component
   analysis, and uni-and multivariate singular spectrum analyses, were
   carried out to characterize the spatial-temporal structures of trend and
   interannual oscillatory variabilities of precipitation over the major
   north-flowing river basins in the former Soviet Union.
   The series of monthly precipitation were corrected for the biases of
   precipitation measurement due to the gauge-type change and changes in
   observing procedures. An upward trend was found in the monthly
   precipitation series for the last half century. This upward trend was
   stronger in the North Dvina and Pechora River basins, and in the
   Ob-Irtysh River basins, but much weaker (still upward, though) in the
   Yenisey-Lena River basins. The notable increases of precipitation over
   the southwestern part-the Volga and Ural River basins-were found to be
   due at least in part to the upward phase of some quasi-century
   periodicity. Generally speaking, the precipitation increases appeared to
   be more apparent during the cold seasons in the western half of the
   sector, while in the eastern part, it appeared to be equally or more
   notable during summer.
   On the interannual timescales, signals of 4-5-yr and quasi-biennial
   oscillations were found in the space-time-dependent precipitation
   series. The 4-5-yr oscillation was quite apparent over the entire
   Northern Eurasian sector, being stronger over the southeastern and
   western parts. This oscillation appeared to propagate eastward. The
   quasi-biennial oscillation was generally weaker; it was very weak during
   the 1955-65 period. This oscillation was relatively stronger in the
   western half of the sector and weaker over the eastern half.},

   spatial distribution results of slope unit hazards in the study area
   from the 1980s to the 2010s, 2025, and 2030 were evaluated and

Title = {60-year trends of δ<SUP>18</SUP>O in global precipitation reveal large
   scale hydroclimatic variations},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {195},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sixty years of monthly data series of delta O-18 in precipitation
   revealed distinctive decadal long-term patterns and break points for the
   isotope composition of global precipitation. Our results showed that at
   the multi-decadal scale, delta O-18 in precipitation displayed changes
   due to large-scale hydroclimate processes, and particularly, from
   atmospheric oscillations. Break point and segmented regression trend
   analyses for delta O-18 and air temperature revealed influences of the
   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the long-term isotope variability
   for most continental stations in Northern Hemisphere. Long-term trends
   of 318O and precipitation amount for Southern Hemisphere stations were
   mostly indicative of changes in regional hydroclimate processes driven
   by the larger scale Atlantic and Pacific atmospheric oscillations. For
   oceanic island stations, the delta O-18 variations could be described by
   sinusoidal trends with a 20-40 years-time cycle and delta O-18 amplitude
   of-1-2 parts per thousand, suggesting these stations have a higher
   sensitivity to multi-decadal atmospheric circulation. Our findings
   reveal that coordinated long-term monitoring of stable isotopes in
   precipitation, coupled with basic meteorological parameters such as air
   temperature and precipitation amount, are essential to better understand
   the impact of larger scale hydroclimate variation on regional and local
   climate variability, and to help interpret long-term hydroclimatic
   changes of the past, present and future.},

Abstract = {Changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation have great
   impacts on drought/flood risk and utilization of water resources. In
   this study, we presented the results of a comparative analysis of
   spatial-temporal variability of precipitation in the Southwest China.
   The analysis investigated the trends of annual precipitation and
   explored the changes of two indices: the precipitation concentration
   index (PCI) and the concentration index (CI) which are designed for
   measuring seasonality and daily heterogeneity, respectively. The trends
   of annual precipitation and CI were tested by the Mann-Kendall method.
   The results show a significant seasonality of the rainfall distribution
   and very inhomogeneous temporal distribution of the daily rainfall in
   the study area. Positive trends in the CI were found at most stations,
   although most of them were not statistically significant. To detect the
   futures trends of precipitation in the study area, Hurst's rescaled
   range (R/S) analysis was introduced and the corresponding Hurst Exponent
   was estimated. The results suggested that some drought hazards will
   happen in the intersection of Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan, and the west
   part of Sichuan, the north part of Chongqing and the middle part of
   Yunnan are under the risk of flood in the future.},

Abstract = {Secular trends of daily precipitation characteristics are considered in
   the transient climate change experiment with a coupled atmosphere-ocean
   general circulation model ECHAM4/OPYC3 for 1900-2099. The climate
   forcing is due to increasing concentrations of the greenhouse gases in
   the atmosphere. Mean daily precipitation, precipitation intensity,
   probability of wet days and parameters of the gamma distribution are
   analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the changes of heavy
   precipitation, Analysis of the annual mean precipitation trends for
   1900-1999 revealed general agreement with observations with significant
   positive trends in mean precipitation over continental areas. In the
   2000-2099 period precipitation trend patterns followed the tendency
   obtained for 1900-1999 but with significantly increased magnitudes.
   Unlike the annual mean precipitation trends for which negative values
   were found for some continental areas, the mean precipitation intensity
   and scale parameter of the fitted gamma distribution increased over all
   land territories . Negative trends in the number of wet days were found
   over most of the land areas except high latitudes in the Northern
   Hemisphere. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution in general
   revealed a slight negative trend in the areas of the precipitation
   increase. Investigation of daily precipitation revealed an
   unproportional increase of heavy precipitation events for the land areas
   including local maxima in Europe and the eastern United States.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To investigate whether the predictions of increased precipitation
   magnitude and longer periods of low precipitation are manifesting itself
   in precipitation records of major world cities, the moving average and
   moving standard deviations were analyzed for trends. If the moving
   average of precipitation is increasing in time, then it is assumed that
   rainfall is trending upwards. Similarly, for increasing drought periods,
   it is assumed that if the moving standard deviation is increasing over
   time, then drought is increasing. For the 50 highest-populated world
   cities, it was found that Dhaka, Bangladesh was the city that was
   affected most for both flooding and drought, Kinshasa Congo had the
   highest upward trend for flooding, Manila, Philippines had the highest
   upward trend for drought, and Chengdu, China had a decreasing trend for
   both flooding and drought. The results were the same even after
   adjusting for population size, except that Shenzhen, China had the
   fastest decreasing trend for drought. Some precipitation data sets
   exhibited a cyclical nature, perhaps due to the oscillation of the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation and/or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {18-34},

Abstract = {Study region: Island state of Tasmania, Australia.
   Study focus: This study detected monotonic and step trends in maximum
   sub-daily precipitation for durations ranging from 3 to 24 h over the
   period 19612100. It also looked at whether or not there is agreement
   between six dynamically downscaled global circulation models (GCMs) in
   terms of the extent and magnitude of monotonic and step trends in the
   dataset. This was done using a split-apply-combine approach for data
   manipulation. The study included trend evaluation, application of a
   smoothing algorithm, and the application of non-parametric and
   parametric statistical tests on low pass filtered series.
   New hydrological insights: Monotonic and step trends in maximum
   sub-daily precipitation occurring in each month were identified across
   the state. Decreasing trends were found to become more evident in the
   Central Plateau region. There was reasonable agreement between GCMs on
   the sign and the magnitude of the precipitation changes, with the
   exception of the Central Plateau region of Tasmania, where the GCMs
   disagreed as to the spatial extent of the decreasing in trends.
   The duration and intensity (percentile) of maximum sub-daily
   precipitation were found to influence trends in sub-daily precipitation.
   Evidence of spatial patterns in monotonic and step trends for the data
   between the baseline period (19611990) and future climates (20102039,
   20402069, and 20702099) have been evaluated. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Abstract = {This paper provides an insight into the long-term trends of the four
   seasonal and annual precipitations in various climatological regions and
   sub-regions in India. The trends were useful to investigate whether
   Indian seasonal rainfall is changing in terms of magnitude or
   location-wise. Trends were assessed over the period of 1954-2003 using
   parametric ordinary least square fits and non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   technique. The trend significance was tested at the 95\% confidence
   level. Apart from the trends for individual climatological regions in
   India and the average for the whole of India, trends were also
   specifically determined for the possible smaller geographical areas in
   order to understand how different the trends would be from the bigger
   spatial scales. The smaller geographical regions consist of the whole
   southwestern continental state of Kerala. It was shown that there are
   decreasing trends in the spring and monsoon rainfall and increasing
   trends in the autumn and winter rainfalls. These changes are not always
   homogeneous over various regions, even in the very short scales implying
   a careful regional analysis would be necessary for drawing conclusions
   regarding agro-ecological or other local projects requiring change in
   rainfall information. Furthermore, the differences between the trend
   magnitudes and directions from the two different methods are
   significantly small and fall well within the significance limit for all
   the cases investigated in Indian regions (except where noted).},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Arabian Peninsula (AP) and Eastern Mediterranean (EM) are two of the
   hottest regions in the world; and their temperature increased enormously
   in the last century. In addition, water scarcity has been one of the
   vital issues from the beginning of civilization in these lands. Hence,
   plant, animal species, and human life in this domain have been in really
   big danger. Moreover, serious economic and socio-political conflicts in
   the societies and struggles between countries are expected to emerge in
   near future. Monthly precipitation observation data set of CRU with a
   0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees resolution is used to investigate the
   nonlinear dynamics of precipitation over AP and EM. Reconstruction of
   phase space technique is applied to find delay times and embedding
   dimensions. The delay time changes between 2 and 10 months and embedding
   dimension alters between 10 and 26. The maximum Lyapunov exponents are
   also calculated to find the possibility of chaos in each grid points.
   Apart from the northern Turkey, one can claim strong possibility of
   chaos over the study regions. The originality of this research stems
   from the fact that it is the first time where the aforementioned
   variables are analyzed spatially in the region. In addition, trend
   analysis of precipitation is also studied in three different periods
   (1901-1951, 1952-2002, and 1901-2002) over AP and EM. According to
   findings, the precipitation tends to increase over most of the region in
   the first period, but it started to decrease in the second period.},

Abstract = {Longitudinal analyses of hydro-meteorological variables are extremely
   important for climate studies and water resources planning.
   Precipitation across the most severely eroded areas of Huangfuchuan
   Watershed in the Loess Plateau, China was analysed using data from 10
   rainfall stations during the period 1954-2010. The ensemble empirical
   mode decomposition (EEMD), Hurst exponent, and Mann-Kendall methods were
   utilized to detect periodicities, discontinuities as well as long-term
   persistence of precipitation. The results show abrupt changes (i.e.
   discontinuities) in spring during the period 1963-1969 and in 1975, the
   summer period of 1962 and 1986-1994, the autumn of 1978, and the winter
   of 1964. These abrupt changes were determined to be statistically
   significant at the P = 0.05 level. There were inter-annual periods of
   quasi-3- and quasi-6-year for annual and the four seasons, and decadal
   periods of quasi-10-, quasi-15-, quasi-25- and quasi-50-year for
   different seasons. However, periodical features in inter-annual periods
   were not statistically noticeable. Moreover, Hurst exponent analysis
   indicated that the current trends of precipitation over the four seasons
   would continue in the future. The results also indicate that the EEMD
   method is able to effectively reveal deviations in long-term
   precipitation series at various timescales and could be utilized for
   complex analysis of non-stationary and nonlinear signal change. These
   findings could provide important information for ecological restoration
   and farming operations across the study region.},

Abstract = {This study characterizes the spatial and temporal patterns of aerosol
   and precipitation composition at six sites across the United States
   Southwest between 1995 and 2010. Precipitation accumulation occurs
   mostly during the wintertime (December-February) and during the monsoon
   season (July-September). Rain and snow pH levels are usually between
   5-6, with crustal-derived species playing a major role in acid
   neutralization. These species (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) exhibit their
   highest concentrations between March and June in both PM2.5 and
   precipitation due mostly to dust. Crustal-derived species concentrations
   in precipitation exhibit positive relationships with SO42-, NO3-, and
   Cl-, suggesting that acidic gases likely react with and partition to
   either crustal particles or hydrometeors enriched with crustal
   constituents. Concentrations of particulate SO42- show a statistically
   significant correlation with rain SO42- unlike snow SO42-, which may be
   related to some combination of the vertical distribution of SO42- (and
   precursors) and the varying degree to which SO42--enriched particles act
   as cloud condensation nuclei versus ice nuclei in the region. The coarse
   : fine aerosol mass ratio was correlated with crustal species
   concentrations in snow unlike rain, suggestive of a preferential role of
   coarse particles (mainly dust) as ice nuclei in the region.
   Precipitation NO3-:SO42- ratios exhibit the following features with
   potential explanations discussed: (i) they are higher in precipitation
   as compared to PM2.5; (ii) they exhibit the opposite annual cycle
   compared to particulate NO3- : SO42- ratios; and (iii) they are higher
   in snow relative to rain during the wintertime. Long-term trend analysis
   for the monsoon season shows that the NO3-:SO42- ratio in rain increased
   at the majority of sites due mostly to air pollution regulations of
   SO42- precursors.},

Pages = {185-200},
Abstract = {Application of a generalized time series decomposition technique shows
   that observed German monthly precipitation time series can be
   interpreted as a realization of a Gumbel-distributed random variable
   with time-dependent location parameter and time-dependent scale
   parameter The achieved complete analytical description of the series,
   that is, the probability density function (PDF) for every time step of
   the observation period, allows probability assessments of extreme values
   for any threshold at any time So, we found in the western part of
   Germany that climate is getting more extreme in winter Both the
   probability for exceeding the 95th percentile and the probability for
   falling under the 5th percentile are increasing Contrary results are
   found in summer The spread of the distribution is shrinking But in the
   south, relatively high precipitation sums become more likely and
   relatively low precipitation sums become more unlikely in turn of the
   twentieth century
   Furthermore, the decomposition technique provides the mean value of the
   Gumbel-distributed random variable for every time step, too So, an
   alternative approach for estimating trends in observational
   precipitation time series is achieved On that way, the non-Gaussian
   characteristics can be taken into account and robust estimates can be
   provided In contrast, application of the least-squares estimator to
   non-Gaussian climate time series often leads to everestimated trends in
   the expected value},

Title = {Regional trends of daily precipitation indices in northwest Mexico and
   southwest United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {115},
Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {A regionalization based on a rotated principal component analysis (PCA)
   was used to produce six precipitation regions in northwest Mexico and
   the southwest United States. Monthly precipitation data from 184
   meteorological stations for the 1960-1997 period were used in the PCA.
   The aim of this study was to estimate annual and seasonal trends of 10
   daily precipitation indices in the six regions, including four indices
   related with extreme precipitation. The annual indices show a larger
   number of statistically significant trends than the seasonal indices,
   especially in Arizona-New Mexico and in the monsoon region in northwest
   Mexico (MON). Significant positive trends common to these two contiguous
   regions are extreme precipitation exceeding the 95th (R95p) and 99th
   (R99p) percentiles. The analysis of summer (June-October) daily
   precipitation indices also reveals the occurrence of significant
   positive trends in R95p in MON, mainly due to tropical cyclone activity.
   With the exception of the trends in MON, the most important contribution
   to the annual trends comes from the winter indices. Four of the six
   regions in the study area show significant positive trends in extreme
   winter precipitation (R10mm, R95p or R99p) during the study period. The
   variability of the annual indices that show statistically significant
   trends in extreme precipitation are partially linked to natural
   variations resulting from the combined effects of El Nino/Southern
   Oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and, in most
   cases, the trends are explained by the PDO.},

Abstract = {Heavy rainfall events are likely to become more frequent and severe in
   the next future, under the effects of a changing climate. In this
   context, the scientific literature is characterized by a relevant number
   of studies trying to identify the convective component of precipitation,
   since this kind of phenomena, due to their short duration and high
   intensity, may lead to an increased risk of flash floods or debris flows
   and, consequently, human life losses and economic damages. In this
   study, a separation between the convective and stratiform precipitation,
   starting from the subhourly precipitation time series recorded over
   Sicily (Italy), is provided on a monthly scale. Results show that the
   percentage of convective precipitation increases as the associated
   intensity increases, following what is generally known about convective
   events. Moreover, during the summer months, higher percentages of
   convective rainfall are generally reached for lower values of intensity,
   since this season favours the occurrence of these phenomena due to high
   temperature and relative humidity. In addition to the regional analysis,
   even an at-site analysis has been carried out, through the definition of
   a critical intensity threshold to identify the predominant convective
   component for each rain gauge. This analysis has pointed out that such
   convective events have occurred mainly in the east part of the island
   mainly due to the complex orography of this area, which favours the
   occurrence not only of such phenomena but of flash floods and debris
   flows as well.},

Title = {Precipitation Trends Analysis Using Gridded Dynamic Sampling Zones: Case
   Study Yangtze Delta Megalopolis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {As a result of the fast growth of remote sensing and data assimilation
   technology, many global land use land cover (LULC) and climate
   reanalysis data sets have been used to advance our understanding of
   climate and environmental change. This paper investigates the
   precipitation variations of the Yangtze Delta Megalopolis by using
   precipitation reanalysis data under conditions of dynamic urban sprawl.
   Compared with current precipitation characteristic analyses, which are
   often based on a limited number of ground rainfall stations, the
   approach followed in this study comprises a grid-based statistical
   method using large sets of samples with a uniform distribution and a
   same representative grid area. This novel approach of dynamic sampling
   is applied in this study to overcome the temporal and spatial
   inconsistency of stationary sampling. This approach allows to examine
   the impact of urbanization on regional precipitation characteristics.
   The Yangtze Delta Megalopolis (YDM) region, one of the most developed
   regions in China, was selected as a case study to evaluate the impact of
   urbanization on subsequent precipitation features. The results reveal
   that the annual total precipitation (TP) and the maximum daily
   precipitation (MDP) in both urban and non-urban areas of the YDM region
   generally have increased during the past 30 years. Hence, the region has
   become increasingly humid. Extrema of annual MDP and TP show obvious
   spatial characteristics, in which most maxima are located in the
   southern part of YDM while minima are more concentrated in the northern
   part. This newly developed approach has potentials for application in
   studies where underlying surface features exhibit rapid alterations. The
   findings of this case study provide relevant information for planning
   and design of regional water resources management, flood risk
   management, and planning of the urban drainage system of the YDM region.},

Abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) experienced a rapid warming and wetting in
   recent decades. The elevation dependence of warming rate has been
   established, while the question of trend in precipitation against the
   elevation gradient remains open. By using the in situ observation of
   precipitation, air temperature, and surface specific humidity from 91
   stations over and around the TP, this study investigated how the trends
   in summer precipitation varied along the elevation gradient over and
   around the TP during the period 1970-2014. The major findings are as
   follows: (1) the trends in summer precipitation from 1970 to 2014
   displayed an increasing tendency at a rate of 0.83\% decade(-1) km(-1)
   with the increased elevation, and the rate for 1991-2014 (2.23\%
   decade(-1) km(-1)) is even greater and (2) the temporal trends in
   surface air temperature, surface specific humidity (surface water
   vapour) from in situ observations and total column of water vapour from
   Japanese 55-year reanalysis (JRA-55) data overmost stations consistently
   display similar elevation dependence, which provides a plausible
   explanation for the elevation dependence of the summer precipitation
   trends based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. The large-scale
   atmospheric circulations are other possible factors influencing the
   elevation dependence of summer precipitation trends, which needs further
   investigations.},

Abstract = {Precipitation extremes in mainland Portugal (south-western Europe) using
   daily precipitation data recorded in the period 1941-2007 (67 years) at
   57 meteorological stations scattered across the area are studied at an
   annual scale. Trends in selected precipitation annual indices that are
   calculated from these data are investigated, in particular trends in the
   intensity, frequency and duration of extreme precipitation events.
   Special attention is dedicated to local and regional variability. The
   spatial correlations between the annual trends in mean precipitation and
   in the extremes are analysed. Moreover, the relationships between the
   variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and several
   indices related to the frequency and intensity of the precipitation at
   the 57 stations were also investigated. Results show that several
   stations have predominantly negative tendencies in the precipitation
   indices, although the majority of stations did not show statistically
   significant change over time in the 1941-2007 period. At the regional
   level, the decreasing trend in the simple daily precipitation intensity
   index is the only one statistically significant at the 5 \% level and
   appears to be related to the predominance of the positive phase of the
   NAO. For the period 1976-2007, the proportion of the total precipitation
   attributed to heavy and very heavy precipitation events increased and,
   consequently, daily precipitation events show a tendency to become more
   intense. Moreover, correlation analysis show that the most extreme
   events could be changing at a faster absolute rate in relation to the
   mean than more moderate events.},

Title = {Historical trends in precipitation and stream discharge at the Skjern
   River catchment, Denmark},

Abstract = {A 133 yr data set from the 1055 km(2) Skjern River catchment in western
   Denmark has been analysed with respect to precipitation, temperature,
   evapotranspiration and discharge. The precipitation series have been
   tested and corrected using the standard normal homogeneity test and
   subsequently corrected for undercatch. The degree of change in the
   climatic variables is examined using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test. During the last 133 yr the area has experienced a significant
   change in precipitation of 26\% and a temperature change of 1.4 degrees
   C, leading to increases in river discharge of 52\% and groundwater
   recharge of 86 \%. A lumped conceptual hydrological model, NAM, was
   calibrated on the period 1951-1980 and showed generally an excellent
   match between simulated and observed discharge. The capability of the
   hydrological model to predict climate change impact was investigated by
   looking at performances outside the calibration period. The results
   showed a reduced model fit, especially for recent time periods (after
   the 1980s), and not all hydrological changes could be explained. This
   might indicate that hydrological models cannot be expected to predict
   climate change impacts on discharge as accurately in the future,
   compared to the performance under present conditions, where they can be
   calibrated. The (simulated) stream discharge was subsequently analysed
   using high flow and drought indices based on the threshold method. The
   extreme signal was found to depend highly on the period chosen as
   reference to normal. The analysis indicated that no significant
   amplitude increase of the hydrograph for both wet and dry extremes could
   be found superimposed on the overall discharge increase.},

Title = {Recent precipitation trends in Hungary in the context of larger scale
   climatic changes},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {255-271},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The time series of monthly precipitation totals from 14 Hungarian
   observing stations (1901-1998) were analysed to reveal the long term
   changes in precipitation characteristics occurred in the 20th century. A
   particular attention was given to the changes in the recent decades and
   their links with the larger scale climatic and circulation changes over
   Europe and the Atlantic.
   The statistical significances of systematic changes are controlled by
   linear trend analysis and the Mann-Kendall test. The long term
   fluctuations are illustrated applying a 15-point Gaussian filter on the
   time series. The Standardised Precipitation Index is used to evaluate
   the changes in the drought event frequency. The relationships with
   larger scale changes are mostly discussed relying on contemporary
   papers, and the Grosswetterlagen Catalogue is used as well.
   The annual precipitation total decreased by 15-20\% in Hungary during
   the 20th century. The decline is substantial in both halves of the
   century, but the precipitation sums in the transition seasons declined
   in the first 50 years, and the winter precipitation decreased in the
   latest decades. The precipitation total of the period November-February
   declined significantly in the last 50 years. In the same time the mean
   winter value of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) increased,
   the positions of the main pressure patterns over the Atlantic are
   shifted northeastward, and lot of other coherent changes detected in the
   winter climate of the European-Atlantic region. The mean summer
   precipitation total has hardly changed, but the frequency of summer
   drought events increased. There are some signs of a shift of the
   Hungarian summer climate towards a Mediterranean like climate.},

Abstract = {We analyzed spatiotemporal precipitation trends within the Yellow River
   Basin (YRB) in China and examined the connection between the changes in
   average and extreme precipitation indices. Data from 423 weather
   stations recorded from 1961 to 2016 were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall
   test to explore the linear trends of relationships between various
   indices, along with a simple linear regression used to detect monotonic
   positive or negative trends in the annual and seasonal precipitation
   data. Moreover, we divided the YRB into three distinct topographic
   regions to better understand the effect of regional geography on
   precipitation patterns. Our results demonstrated that mean precipitation
   and extreme precipitation days in different areas of the YRB had
   different variation trends. Precipitation in the YRB overall showed a
   negative trend, as did extreme precipitation days in the lower YRB. Mean
   and extreme precipitation indices were significantly correlated both
   annually and seasonally. These results may be helpful in preparing for
   both drought and flood events.},

Abstract = {Heavy precipitation and the resulting flooding are the most serious
   weather-related hazards over the west coast of North America. This paper
   analyzes the trends in heavy precipitation for the period 1950-2009 by
   examining the decadal distributions of the top 60, 40, and 20 two-day
   precipitation events for a collection of stations along the coastal zone
   of the United States and British Columbia, as well as the decadal
   distribution of maximum daily discharge for unregulated rivers from
   northern California to Washington State. During the past 60 years there
   has been a modest increase in heavy precipitation events over southern
   and central coastal California, a decline in heavy events from northern
   California through the central Oregon coast, a substantial increase in
   major events over Washington, and a modest increase over coastal British
   Columbia. Most of these trends are not significantly different from zero
   at the 95\% level. The trends in maximum daily discharge of unregulated
   rivers are consistent with the above pattern, with increasing discharges
   over the past three decades over Washington and northern Oregon and
   declines over the remainder of Oregon and northern California. Finally,
   the above trends in heavy rainfall and daily discharge are compared to
   the future patterns indicated by general circulation models under
   various global warming scenarios.},

Abstract = {A sample of 92 daily precipitation series was selected in the French
   Mediterranean region over the period 1945-2004, to study the
   stationarity of extreme events. The criticized series are used to define
   seven homogeneous climatic zones. For each one, regional series of daily
   peaks over threshold records are extracted from the raw data. A new
   adaptation of the Peak Over Threshold (POT) methodology is proposed for
   the search of non stationarity. For that purpose, we suppose that the
   scale and occurrence parameters of the model are not constant, and
   linearly depend on time. This approach allows us to study the
   stationarity of both the occurrence and the intensity of extreme events,
   at the regional scale. The only statistically significant results
   concern an increase of the occurrence and intensity of extreme daily
   rains in the North of the Lozere `department' (France) and the southern
   part of the Auvergne, as well as an increase of the intensity of extreme
   rainfalls in Languedoc-Roussillon.},

   precipitation-weighted concentration data from 164 National Atmospheric
   Deposition Program National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) sites operational

   ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, sum of
   nitrogen from nitrate and ammonium), and earth crustal cations (ECC, sum
   of calcium, magnesium, and potassium). Over the 18-year period,
   statistically significant (p <= 0.10) increases in ammonium
   concentrations occurred at 93 sites (58\%), while just three sites had
   statistically significant ammonium decreases. Central and northern
   Midwestern states had the largest ammonium increases. The generally
   higher ammonium concentrations were accompanied by significant sulfate
   decreases (139 sites, 85\%), and only one significant increase which
   occured in Texas. In the west central United States there were
   significant nitrate increases (45 sites, 27\%), while in the
   northeastern United States there were significant decreases (25 sites,
   15\%). Significant DIN decreases were observed in the northeastern
   United States (11 sites, 7\%); elsewhere there were significant
   increases at 75 sites (46\%). ECC decreased significantly at 65 sites
   (40\%), predominately in the central and southern United States, and
   increased at 11 sites (7\%). The concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, and
   ammonium in precipitation have changed markedly over the time period
   studied. Such trends indicate changes in the mix of gases and particles
   scavenged by precipitation, possibly reflecting changes in emissions,
   atmospheric chemical transformations, and weather patterns. (c) 2004

Abstract = {The civil war, harsh climate, tough topography, and lack of accurate
   meteorological stations have limited the number of consecutive synoptic
   data across Afghanistan. The global data (gridded precipitation
   datasets) pave the way to assess the precipitation indicators of
   climate, where stations arc sparsely located. This study assessed the
   mean annual precipitation trend in 33 stations over Afghanistan.
   Non-parametric linear regression technique was employed to find upward
   and downward trends and magnitudes. The daily of precipitation was
   obtained from the database of the CPC-NOAA (Climate Prediction Center -
   National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration) for the period of
   1979-2019. The CPC spatial resolution of daily precipitation is 0.5x0.5
   degree. Analysis of mean annual precipitation showed a significant
   decreasing trend at six provinces in the north, while an increasing
   trend of 9.2 mm per decade has been observed at three provinces. In the
   south, a notable reduction of the precipitation trend has been
   experienced in I lelmand. Kandahar. and Nimruz provinces, but Ghazni and
   Uruzgan show a positive trend. Data revealed that mean annual
   precipitation has remarkably decreased in the western part of
   Afghanistan. According to the study period, the mean annual rainfall in
   the central regions indicates a raise of 37.5 mm per decade in Kabul,
   while in Vardalc the precipitation increases up to 9.21 mm per year.
   Eastern regions include 8 provinces, and the eastem highland covers the
   smallest area that is mainly covered In rangeland and the largest
   existing forests. These regions are directly influenced by the moist air
   masses of Indian monsoon getting trapped at the high mountain slopes,
   and it can lead to an increase of rain. Data reveals an upward trend of
   precipitation in the eastern part of Afghanistan.},

Abstract = {The detection and attribution of precipitation changes are fundamental
   for adaptation and mitigation planning. Based on high-quality
   observations, we determined the detectability of the trends of multiple
   precipitation characteristics across China using a field significance
   test. Furthermore, the timing at which spatially aggregated changes
   become significant and do not reflect random internal variability was
   also estimated. The results show that the significant increases in the
   annual total precipitation (PRCPTOT) and simple precipitation intensity
   (SDII) and significant decreases in the wet days (WD) are detectable
   from 1961 to 2017. Namely, the percentage of stations showing
   significant trends exceeds that expected by chance. The time of the
   trend emergence from the mimicked range of internal variability is
   around 2000 for SDII and WD, while the PRCPTOT trend can only be
   significantly detected for recent years. The analysis on precipitation
   of various intensity levels unearths that the significant increases in
   the amount and frequency of extreme heavy precipitation emerged around
   2014, while a significant decreasing trend in light precipitation might
   be detected as early as 2000. Global warming is expected to affect the
   detection of precipitation trends because the timing at which global
   warming signal in trend of precipitation emerges is consistent with the
   time at which the trends become significant. In general, significant
   changes in the PRCPTOT, SDII and WD occur more frequently in winter than
   in summer.},

Abstract = {Climate science is a complex field as climate is governed by processes
   that interact and operate on a vast array of time and space scales. The
   processes involving radiative transfer, chemistry and phase changes of
   water are most easily described at atomic and molecular scales; the
   influence of ice sheets, continents and planetary scale circulations
   controlling the basic energy balance of the planet operate at
   continental scales; even planetary orbital and solar variations
   operating at millennial time scales cannot be ignored. Global as well as
   regional climate has changed due to human activities like land use
   changes, production of industrial effluents and other activities due to
   the development of the society. The consequences of these changes have a
   massive impact on atmospheric events like precipitation, temperature
   etc. So, present and future information of precipitation is required to
   develop adaptation and mitigation strategies at national and
   international levels. Precipitation is one of the major phenomena of the
   atmosphere. So, its prediction and the trend are very necessary to
   realize the change of climate. The study attempted some model based
   analysis to assess prediction of rainfall trend using MK test and the
   Sen's slope estimator.},

Abstract = {Precipitation phase is expected to shift from solid to liquid with
   temperature rising, which would in turn bring challenges to regional
   water resource management. Although in recent decades, consistent
   decreasing trends in the ratio of snowfall to precipitation rate in a
   warming climate have been found across multiple regions, a global view
   of the trends in the precipitation partitioning has not been
   established. In this study, we investigated the global trends of annual
   rain and snow frequency of occurrences and the ratio of number of snow
   events to number of precipitation events (SE/PE ratio) using land
   station and shipboard synoptic present weather reports from 1978 to
   2019. Results show that when averaged over all qualified land stations
   and over the shipboard reports, both the annual rain frequency and snow
   frequency decrease over the 42 years. Over both land and ocean, the
   averaged SE/PE ratio has a significant decreasing trend. Moreover, the
   trend of SE/PE ratio shows a strong latitudinal dependence. At the mid-
   and low latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, the SE/PE ratio has a
   decreasing trend. In contrast, at high latitudes, the SE/PE ratio has an
   increasing trend.},

Abstract = {Drought as an exigent natural phenomenon, with high frequency in arid
   and semi-arid regions, leads to enormous damage to agriculture, economy,
   and environment. In this study, the seasonal Standardized Precipitation
   Index (SPI) drought index and time series models were employed to model
   and predict seasonal drought using climate data of 38 Iranian synoptic
   stations during 1967-2014. In order to model and predict seasonal
   drought ITSM (Interactive Time Series Modeling) statistical software was
   used. According to the calculated seasonal SPI, within the study area,
   drought severity classes 4 and 3 had the greatest occurrence frequency,
   while classes 6 and 7 had the least occurrence frequency. Results
   indicated that the best fitted models were Moving-Average or MA (5)
   Innovations and MA (5) Hannan-Rissenen, with 60.53 and 15.79 percentage,
   respectively. On the other hand, results of the prediction as well,
   indicated that drought class 4 with the highest percentages, was the
   most abundant class over the study area and drought class 7 was the
   least frequent class. According to results of trend analysis, without
   attention to significance of them, observed seasonal SPI data series
   (1967-2014), in 84.21\% of synoptic stations had a negative trend, but
   this percentage changes to 86.84\% when studying the combination of
   observed and predicted simultaneously (1967-2019).},

Abstract = {Precipitation is an important climatic parameter, and its variability
   severely affects regional hydrological processes and water resource
   management. In order to explore the changing spatial and temporal
   characteristics of precipitation-related indices, including
   precipitation amounts indices, extreme precipitation indices, and
   precipitation concentration indices, in Hubei province, central China
   during 1961-2010, several precipitation-related indices series were
   analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test, Pettitt test, and inverse distance
   weighted interpolation method in this paper. The results are as follows:
   (1) A clear south-north gradient is apparent in the spatial distribution
   of the majority of precipitation-related indices, while the distribution
   of other indices (i.e., CDD, PCD, and PCP) is just the opposite. Most
   part of Hubei province can experience mixed positive and negative trends
   in precipitation-related indices. (2) The majority of
   precipitation-related indices exhibit an increasing trend, but most of
   which are not significant. July has the largest positive trend, with a
   regional average of 14.76 mm/decade. As for extreme precipitation
   indices, there exist large variations in Hubei, especially in R95pTOT.
   Besides, no obvious trends are shown in precipitation concentration
   indices. (3) With the exception of consecutive dry days (CDD), most of
   extreme precipitation indices are strongly correlated with annual mean
   precipitation (AMP) in Hubei. And the extreme precipitation indices are
   well correlated with each other except CDD and consecutive wet days
   (CWD). For six precipitation-related indices (i.e., SDII, RX1day,
   RX5day, R95pTOT R99pTOT, and PCD), there are significant positive
   relationships with Northern Hemisphere Subtropical High (NHSH) but
   significant negative relationships with Northern Hemisphere Polar Vortex
   (NHPV). Furthermore, the majority of precipitation-related indices have
   significant negative correlations with East Asian summer monsoon index
   (EASMI) and South China Sea summer monsoon index (SCSSMI), and the
   correlation coefficient with EASMI is higher than that with SCSSMI.},

Abstract = {During the 1960s and 1970s, scientific evidence on the impacts of
   atmospheric acid deposition led to international negotiations to control

Title = {Streamflow trends in Indiana: Effects of long term persistence,
   precipitation and subsurface drains},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {374},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {171-183},
Month = {JUL 30},
Abstract = {Streamflow trends in Indiana are evaluated for 31 USGS gauging stations
   that have 50 years or more continuous unregulated streamflow records.
   Trends are computed for selected streamflow statistics to include annual
   and seasonal low, medium, and high flow conditions by using four
   variations of the Mann-Kendall test. These variations include: (i)
   Mann-Kendall without autocorrelation, (ii) Mann-Kendall with lag-1
   autocorrelation and trend-free pre-whitening, (iii) Mann-Kendall with
   complete autocorrelation structure, and (iv) Mann-Kendall with long term
   persistence. Mann-Kendall test is also applied to the precipitation data
   using the above four approaches to explore the relationship between
   precipitation and stream flow trends. Overall, there is an increasing
   trend in low and medium flow conditions across Indiana. However, these
   trend results are affected by the selection of flow statistic,
   annual/seasonal statistics, data length and consideration of
   autocorrelation structure. Specifically, the number of stations that
   show trends in low and medium flow statistics decreases significantly
   (up to 70\%) when autocorrelation structure is considered in the
   analysis. The precipitation trends, however, are not affected by the
   autocorrelation structure, suggesting that factors other than
   precipitation trends are related to streamflow trends in Indiana. In
   addition, high flows are found to be less correlated to precipitation
   compared to low flows in heavily drained northern Indiana. This suggests
   that the subsurface drainage is playing a role in the observed
   streamflow trends in Indiana, but this issue needs further
   investigation. Overall, this study provides an elaborate view of past
   streamflow trends in Indiana which should be useful for further research
   including understanding the impact of future biofuel activities on
   Indiana hydrology and climate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Linking Historical and Projected Trends in Extreme Precipitation with
   Cumulative Carbon Dioxide Emissions},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},

Pages = {165-182},

Abstract = {Extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and
   intensity in response to higher global temperatures, augmenting societal
   exposure to these events. While the magnitude of projected changes in
   extremes varies considerably among future emission scenarios, a large
   part of this uncertainty is driven by the choice of scenario, rather
   than by the climate response to a particular emission scenario. A
   growing body of research has identified robust linear relationships
   between climate changes and cumulative carbon emissions; for global
   average temperature change, this relationship is known as the transient
   climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE). Extensions of
   the TCRE framework to other variables, such as regional and seasonal
   temperature and precipitation changes, have also shown to be effective,
   raising the possibility that changes in weather extremes could be linked
   to cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Here, we estimate changes
   in historical and projected trends in one-day (Rx1day) and five-day
   maximum precipitation (Rx5day) events as a function of cumulative carbon
   emissions across a range of future emission scenarios and global climate
   models. Our results show that median Rx1day and Rx5day generally
   increases linearly with increasing cumulative emissions, consistent with
   studies that have previously employed the TCRE framework to estimate
   changes in precipitation extremes, as well as other climate indicators.
   Overall, we show that a linear response to cumulative CO2 emissions is a
   good approximation for both historical and future trends in
   precipitation extremes.
   {[}Traduit par la redaction] La frequence et l'intensite des phenomenes
   meteorologiques extremes devraient augmenter en raison de la hausse des
   temperatures mondiales, ce qui accroit l'exposition de la societe a ces
   phenomenes. Si l'ampleur des changements projetes en matiere d'extremes
   varie considerablement selon les scenarios d'emissions futures, une
   grande partie de cette incertitude est attribuable au choix du scenario,
   plutot qu'a la reaction du climat a un scenario d'emissions particulier.
   Un nombre croissant de recherches a permis de determiner des relations
   lineaires solides entre les changements climatiques et les emissions
   cumulees de carbone; pour le changement de la temperature moyenne
   mondiale, cette relation est connue sous le nom de reponse climatique
   transitoire aux emissions cumulees de carbone (RCTE). L'extension du
   cadre RCTE a d'autres variables, telles que les changements regionaux et
   saisonniers de temperature et de precipitations, s'est egalement averee
   efficace, ce qui souleve la possibilite que les changements dans les
   extremes meteorologiques puissent etre lies aux emissions cumulees de
   dioxyde de carbone (CO2). Nous estimons ici les changements dans les
   tendances historiques et projetees des precipitations maximales sur un
   jour (Rx1jour) et sur cinq jours (Rx5jour) en fonction des emissions de
   carbone cumulees a travers une gamme de scenarios d'emissions futures et
   de modeles climatiques globaux. Nos resultats montrent que les Rx1jour
   et Rx5jour medians augmentent generalement de facon lineaire avec la
   hausse des emissions cumulees, ce qui est coherent avec les etudes qui
   ont precedemment utilise le cadre RCTE pour estimer les changements dans
   les precipitations extremes, ainsi que d'autres indicateurs climatiques.
   Dans l'ensemble, nous montrons qu'une reponse lineaire aux emissions
   cumulees de CO2 est une bonne approximation des tendances historiques et

Title = {Identifying Precipitation and Reference Evapotranspiration Trends in
   West Africa to Support Drought Insurance},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {West Africa represents a wide gradient of climates, extending from
   tropical conditions along the Guinea Coast to the dry deserts of the
   south Sahara, and it has some of the lowest income, most vulnerable
   populations on the planet, which increases catastrophic impacts of low
   and high frequency climate variability. This paper investigates low and
   high frequency climate variability in West African monthly and seasonal
   precipitation and reference evapotranspiration from the early 1980s to
   2016. We examine the impact of those trends and how they interact with
   payouts from index insurance products. Understanding low and high
   frequency variability in precipitation and reference evapotranspiration
   at these scales can provide insight into trends during periods critical
   to agricultural performance across the region. For index insurance, it
   is important to identify low-frequency variability, which can result in
   radical departures between designed/planned and actual insurance
   payouts, especially in the later part of a 30-year period, a common
   climate analysis period. We find that evaporative demand and
   precipitation are not perfect substitutes for monitoring crop deficits
   and that there may be space to use both for index insurance design. We
   also show that low yields-aligned with the need for insurance
   payouts-can be predicted using classification trees that include both
   precipitation and reference evapotranspiration.},

Title = {Regionality of long-term trends and interannual variation of seasonal
   precipitation over India},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {This study investigated the long-term trends and interannual variations
   (IAVs) of seasonal precipitation during two different periods in India
   and their relation to atmospheric circulation. To focus on the relation
   between the regional characteristics of precipitation and the
   large-scale circulation system, we defined homogeneous regions based on
   pentad rainfall seasonality using hierarchical cluster analysis. Seven
   obtained clusters (regions) were used to analyze the long-term trends,
   IAVs, and their relation to atmospheric circulation. Seasonal
   precipitation showed no remarkable trend in most regions and seasons,
   which implies the effect of IAV in seasonal precipitation is greater
   than the long-term trend. Based on regression analysis, the IAV of
   seasonal precipitation and its relation to atmospheric circulation over
   the ocean surrounding India were detected for each season. Enhancement
   of the southwesterly monsoon flow over the Indian Ocean and the strength
   of the southeasterly wind related to the activity of the monsoon trough
   around the Gangetic Plain both affected the increase of summer monsoon
   precipitation in regions CL3 (central and eastern India) and CL6
   (western coast of the Arabian Sea in southern India). In contrast,
   neither region CL5 (eastern coastal region of southern India) nor CL7
   (northeastern India and part of the western coastal region of southern
   India) showed a relationship between IAV of summer monsoon precipitation
   and the southwesterly flow or the southeasterly flow over the Indian
   Ocean or the Gangetic Plain, respectively. Region CL5 showed strong
   correlation with the northeasterly monsoon flow (strength of the
   southeasterly flow over the Bay of Bengal) during the post-monsoon
   season. Other regions showed no relation with the northeasterly flow
   during the post-monsoon season. Furthermore, IAV of precipitation in
   region CL7 showed no correlation with either the southwesterly monsoon
   during the summer monsoon season or the northeasterly monsoon during the
   post-monsoon season.},

Title = {Extreme precipitation event over the Yellow Sea western coast: Is there
   a trend?},
Journal = {QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {441},
Number = {A},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Based on dataset at 12 meteorological stations across the Yellow Sea
   western coast (YSWC) during 1951 2011, spatiotemporal variations of
   extreme precipitation events are analyzed by the methods of linear
   regression, Mann Kendall test and wavelet analysis. Results show that
   the majority of precipitation indices exhibit decreasing trends
   excepting for consecutive dry days (CDD) and simple daily intensity
   index (SDII), which display increasing trends in most of locations,
   indicating that the rainfall becomes more concentrated and the intensity
   of precipitation increases in the last decades. Trends in extreme
   precipitation indices have mixed patterns over the intersection regions
   between Shandong and Jiangsu, where the increases in drought-flood
   disasters may be dramatic. Regional extreme precipitation indices in CDD
   and SDII show significant positive trends even though the annual total
   wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT) has a significant decline trend, this
   suggests that the increases in intensity of precipitation cannot
   counteract the decreases in other wet-related indices and the YSWC tends
   to be drier conditions. The temporal variability in seasonal indices of
   max 1-day precipitation (RXI day) and max 5-day precipitation (RX5day)
   shows that winter is becoming the wettest season. And the abrupt shift
   of precipitation regime in the later 1970s is detected for several
   indices. Factor analysis indicates that the changes in precipitation
   extremes, rather moderate rainfall, are of great contributions to the
   variability of annual total rainfall. There are multiple and overlapping
   cycles for most precipitation indices during 1951-2011, suggesting
   variations of time and frequency, while the 12-15-year cycle is
   prevailing for some indices. Further analyses indicate that global
   warming, coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, and urbanization are three
   major forcing factors affecting the variations in precipitation extremes
   over the YSWC during last decades. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All

Abstract = {Hourly precipitation data from 1998 to 2007 spread across 102 stations
   in South Africa were analyzed for trends in extreme hourly precipitation
   events. The analyses were conducted at the seasonal scale for summer and
   winter for nine different variables. The results of our analysis showed
   predominantly positive trends during summer, with the strongest trends
   concentrated in the coastal areas in the southeast. The spatial
   variations in the trends were reversed during the winter season, with
   negative trends observed in the coastal areas and positive trends
   occurring in the interior. The summer patterns also overlap with areas
   experiencing overall increasing trends in annual extreme precipitation
   as well as a stronger diurnal cycle identified in recently published
   literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The knowledge of aridity is needed to explain landscape characteristics
   and the rational utilization of water resources. With global warming, an
   increase in aridity is expected for many parts of the world. This study
   was undertaken to analyse monthly and annual aridity index (IA),
   utilizing ratio of precipitation (P) over reference evapotranspiration
   (ETo), at ten stations located in critical agricultural regions in Iran.
   The Kendall and Spearman tests with considering serial correlation
   effect were used for analysis. An increase in aridity, as the P/ETo
   index decreased, was found during the study period, and the increase was
   more obvious in the semi-arid region of Iran than in the humid region.
   The increase of aridity was caused by the concurrent occurrences of
   negative P trends and positive ETo trends. The results indicated the
   lowest numbers of the negative IA trends in the July series and the
   highest numbers in the January, February and March series. According to
   the TheilSen's estimator, the annual P of the semi-arid and humid
   regions decreased at the average rates of (-)22.87 and (-)6.24 mm year-1
   per decade respectively, whereas the annual ETo values in the semi-arid
   and humid regions increased by (+)11.42 and (+)6.82 mm year-1 per
   decade, respectively. Copyright (C) 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

Title = {Differing trends in the tropical surface temperatures and precipitation
   over land and oceans},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {653-664},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the past 50 years, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical
   latitudes have trended toward a warmer ocean state. As a response,
   tropical land surface temperatures, as well as tropical tropospheric
   temperatures (as manifested in the variations in the 200-mb tropical
   heights), have also trended upward. Analysis of trends in the tropical
   precipitation fields, however, remains problematic because of the
   scarcity of the observed data over the tropical oceans.
   Using both observed data and data from atmospheric general circulation
   model simulations, trends in tropical precipitation over the ocean and
   land are analyzed. The analysis reveals that in the tropical latitudes
   over land, the precipitation trend differs from the trend in the surface
   temperature. Oceanic precipitation has an increasing trend that is
   consistent with increasing SSTs, whereas over the tropical land regions
   precipitation decreases. In contrast, land temperatures increase in
   phase with the trend in SSTs. It is suggested that the combination of
   increasing surface temperature and decreasing precipitation could
   produce considerably greater societal consequences compared with the
   traditionally argued scenario in which both temperature and
   precipitation increase in response to increasing SSTs.},

Abstract = {Changes in precipitation exert an enormous impact on human life, and it
   is of vital importance to study regular patterns of meteorological and
   hydrological events. In order to explore the changing spatial and
   temporal patterns of precipitation amounts, precipitation extremes and
   precipitation concentration in Jiangxi province in southeast China
   between 1960 and 2008, several precipitation indices series were
   analysed using the Mann-Kendall test in this study. Our results indicate
   remarkable differences among the stations with negative and positive
   precipitation trends at the annual, seasonal and monthly scales,
   significant increasing trends are mainly found during January, August,
   winter and summer, while significant decreasing trends mostly are
   observed during October and autumn. For precipitation extremes, most
   precipitation indices suggest that both the intensity and the days of
   extreme precipitation are increasing; the mean precipitation amount,
   especially, on a wet day shows a significant positive trend. When it
   comes to precipitation concentration, the monthly rainfall heterogeneity
   shows an insignificant downward trend, while the contribution of the
   days with greatest rainfall displays an insignificant upward trend.
   Furthermore, the long-range persistence is detected for changing process
   of precipitation amount, extreme precipitation and precipitation
   concentration using the Rescaled Range Analysis.},

Abstract = {Satellite observations (International Satellite Cloud Climatology
   Project (ISCCP), 1983-2009) of linear trends in cloud cover are compared
   to those in global precipitation (Global Precipitation Climatology
   Project (GPCP) pentad V2.2, 1983-2009), to investigate possible cause(s)
   of the linear trends in both cloud cover and precipitation. The spatial
   distributions of the linear trends in total cloud cover and
   precipitation are both characterized primarily by a broadening of the
   major ascending zone of Hadley circulation. Our correlation studies
   suggest that global warming, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) can explain 67 \%, 49\% and 38 \%,
   respectively, of the spatial variabilities in the linear trends in cloud
   cover, but causality is harder to establish. Further analysis of the
   broadening of the major ascending zone of Hadley circulation shows that
   the trend in global temperature, rather than those in AMO and PDO, is
   the primary contributor to the observed linear trends in total cloud
   cover and precipitation in 1983-2009. The underlying mechanism driving
   this broadening is proposed to be the moisture-convection-latent-heat
   feedback cycle under global warming conditions. The global analysis is
   extended by investigating connections between clouds and precipitation
   in China, based on a large number of long-running, high-quality surface
   weather stations in 1957-2005. This reveals a quantitative matching
   relationship between the reduction in light precipitation and the
   reduction in total cloud cover. Furthermore, our study suggests that the
   reduction in cloud cover in China is primarily driven by global
   temperature; PDO plays a secondary role, while the contribution from AMO
   and Nino3.4 is insignificant, consistent with the global analysis.},

   measurement stations a decrease in annual precipitation amount in the
   period 1954-2013 was demonstrated, for Legnica and Opole at a
   significance level above 75\%. Moreover, a decrease in the seasonal
   precipitation amount was noticed, however at a significance level of

Abstract = {Flood risk management is an important and difficult problem for the
   densely populated and rapidly urbanised city of Seoul, South Korea. This
   study characterises long-term trends and variability in the city's
   annual maximum daily precipitation (AMP) over multiple decades.
   Smoothing the time series reveals that recent decades have witnessed a
   steep upward trend in AMP. Continuous wavelet analysis shows that the
   AMP series has statistically significant power in the 32-60-year
   periodicity band between 1880 and 1960 (one full cycle is clearly
   visible in the smoothed series). This feature has an even wider scope in
   the annual total precipitation series, suggesting that a real
   oscillation exists. Four climate indices were investigated as possible
   explanatory variables for the AMP series using cross-wavelet analysis,
   but no significant coherence between the signals was found. Finally,
   mean AMP forecasts based on three interpretations of the past linear
   trend are provided for flood risk management.},

Abstract = {The central USA experienced major flooding during spring 2019, with both
   the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers at major flood stage at several
   locations, causing levees to breach and widespread flooding. Here, we
   examine the total precipitation responsible for the spring 2019 flooding
   across the central USA from the perspective of weather types. We focus
   on the weather type (referred to as `Midwest Water Hose' (MWH) (Zhang
   and Villarini. 2019 Climate Dynamics 53, 4217-4232. ())) that
   contributes the most to the total precipitation across the central USA.
   This weather type contributed to more than 70\% of the total
   precipitation received across much of this region during January-May
   2019, and it has been occurring increasingly frequently over the past 40
   years. Furthermore, we found that climate model experiments with the
   historical change of greenhouse gas concentration can well reproduce the
   observed rising trend, while this is not the case for the natural
   forcing experiments. Therefore, the rising trend and the high frequency
   of the MWH can be mainly attributed to the rising greenhouse gases
   caused by human activities, rather than natural forcing.
   This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Intensification of
   short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood
   risks'.},

Title = {Precipitation Trends Over Mainland China From 1961-2016 After Removal of

Abstract = {Following the removal of measurement biases from daily observed gauge
   records for the period 1961-2016 at 2,250 national stations over
   mainland China, the precipitation trends and causes were analyzed.
   Measured annual precipitation trends have been overestimated to varying
   degrees in most regions, with the exceptions of Northwest China and
   northern Tibet. On average, the annual precipitation trend over mainland
   China decreased from 3.98 to 2.04 mm/10 yr after bias adjustment. The
   dramatically precipitation-increasing (wetting) zones in Northeast China
   and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were found to be disappearing
   at a faster rate than what we observed. Meanwhile, the extent of
   markedly precipitation-decreasing (drying) zones in the Yellow River
   Basin shrank more slowly than what was indicated by measured records.
   Adjusted annual light rain amounts exhibited a weaker increasing trend
   over mainland China; conversely, adjusted annual rainstorm amounts
   displayed stronger increasing trends than reported previously. The
   changes of trace precipitation days, precipitation days, mean wind speed
   on precipitation days, and observed precipitation amount comprehensively
   affected the trends of bias-removed precipitation. The declines in
   measured wind speed and precipitation amount resulted in accelerated
   reductions in adjusted precipitation over Southwest and North China. In
   Southeast China, the increasing trend of bias-adjusted precipitation was
   smaller than that indicated by original data due to the reduction in
   mean wind speed when precipitation occurred. In Northwest China and
   northern Tibet, however, the increases in measured precipitation amount
   and precipitation days mutually led to larger increasing trends in the
   adjusted data.},

Abstract = {Changes in precipitation extremes in the tropical urban context is
   complex, where the precipitation activities are influenced by the
   combined effects of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), global warming
   and local effects. This study presents a comprehensive framework to
   investigate the variability and trends in precipitation extremes in a
   tropical urban city-state, Singapore, based on a set of extreme indices
   recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices
   (ETCCDI). The long-term trends in the precipitation extremes over the
   period from 1980 until 2013 are examined using an iterative-based
   Mann-Kendall trend test. Besides, the relative importance of
   precipitation frequency and intensity in inter-annual variability of
   wet-day precipitation totals is investigated. Finally, the correlations
   between precipitation extremes and three potential large-scale and local
   factors, i.e. ENSO, global mean temperature and local temperature are
   analysed based on linear regression method. Results reveal that annual
   wet-day precipitation totals, as well as average wet-day precipitation
   intensity, have increased significantly, accompanied by a significant
   increase in the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes in
   Singapore. The inter-annual variability of wet-day precipitation totals
   is mainly dominated by precipitation intensity. Significant correlations
   are found between precipitation extremes and all the three factors, and
   the signature of local effects is more evident than global warming.
   These findings have implications for adaption planning and disaster risk
   reduction in Singapore in the context of global warming.},

Abstract = {Here we characterized wet deposition National Atmospheric Deposition
   Program (NADP) species and Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET)
   dry deposited particle and gas species across New York over the last 2-3
   decades. In addition measurements of NH3 from the Ammonia Monitoring
   Network (AMoN) were analyzed. In general decreasing annual trends are
   observed for wet deposition SO42+ and NO3+ species and dry deposited
   particle SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ as well as gas phase SO2 and HNO3
   consistent with reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions. Wet deposited NH4+
   however does not show consistent trends with most sites showing little
   trend across the region and an indication that levels at some sites
   maybe increasing. NH3 concentrations also appear to be increasing
   although the data record is only 8 years. Base cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+
   show some decreases in the 1980s but concentrations are relatively
   uniform since the mid-1990s. Na+ and K+ show large year to year
   variations, by more than an order of magnitude for Na+ due to influence
   of marine air at a near coastal site. In general there was a balance
   between the sum of cations and the sum of anions earlier in the record
   but the tendency has been for a cation excess in the more recent 5-10
   years. Understanding the deposition of reduced nitrogen species is
   likely to be of concern for the foreseeable future. Such data are
   important in understanding acidification recovery in response to
   emission controls. (C) 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution

Abstract = {Southern South America (SSA), considered as the continental region south
   of 20 degrees S, has experienced significant precipitation variability
   and trends in the last decades. This article uses monthly
   quality-controlled precipitation data from rainfall stations with
   continuous observations during at least 100years to quantify long-term
   trends as well as interannual-to-centennial variability. Several
   statistical methods are applied to the data, primarily to detect jumps
   and look for changes due to relocation of the gauge stations, as well as
   to identify significant trends. Most of the regions have registered an
   increase in annual rainfall, largely attributable to changes in the warm
   season. On the other hand, during winter most stations in Argentina and
   Brazil do not have significant trends, although eastern Patagonia
   registered an increase in precipitation and Chile, a marked decrease in
   rainfall. In order to look into the physical mechanisms behind the
   observed variability, the changes in mean sea level pressure and
   precipitable water are quantified for different sub-periods. Also
   explored is the variability related to the Hadley cell width and
   strength over the region around SSA. Results show that the Hadley cell
   has shrunk and shifted towards the equator in winter over the area,
   which has caused an enhancement of the sinking motion over much of
   Argentina, Chile and Brazil, while likely increasing the baroclinicity
   (and associated precipitation) over Patagonia. In summer, the strength
   of the subsidence decreased and this was associated with an increase of
   the low-level moisture advection, favouring more rainfall. The
   observational evidence presented here suggests that the zonal asymmetry
   in the change of the Hadley cell position over SSA could be linked to
   the presence of the Andes Cordillera.},

Abstract = {The meteorological drought, caused by a shortage of precipitation over a
   certain period, is the root of a causal chain in drought series in
   agriculture, ecology and hydrology. Different precipitation datasets
   produced inconsistent conclusions in the characteristics and trends of
   drought events. This study analyzed the characteristics and trends of
   meteorological drought over China using the standardized precipitation
   index (SPI) derived from TRMM and CMORPH precipitation data. The annual
   precipitation over China was increased from 1998 to 2014, indicating a
   wetting trend over China in the past near twenty years. CMORPH data
   showed more significant wetting trend than TRMM data. The wetting trend
   mainly occurred in northern China, while southern China has experienced
   a drying trend. The drying trend over China in spring and summer is more
   obvious than in autumn and winter. However, all analysis showed that the
   drought area over China as a whole was decreasing from 1998 to 2014.},

Abstract = {We applied the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Bayesian model to
   systematically explore trends and abrupt changes of the precipitation
   series in the Pearl River basin. The results showed that no significant
   trends were detected for annual precipitation and summer or winter
   precipitation totals. Significant negative trends were identified for
   the number of rainy days across the Pearl River basin; significant
   positive trends were observed regarding precipitation intensity (PI). In
   particular, the precipitation totals and frequencies of extremely high
   precipitation events are subject to significant positive trends. In
   addition, the number of extremely low precipitation events was also
   increasing significantly. Factors affecting the changes in precipitation
   patterns are the weakening Asian monsoon and consequently increasing
   moisture transport to Southern China and the Pearl River basin. In
   summary, the main findings of this study are: (1) increased
   precipitation variability and high-intensity rainfall was observed
   though rainy days and low-intensity rainfall have decreased, and (2) the
   amount of rainfall has changed little but its variability has increased
   over the time interval divided by change points. These finds indicate
   potentially increased risk for both agriculture and in locations subject
   to flooding, both urban and rural, across the Pearl River basin.

Abstract = {The Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna (GBM) river basins occupy about 1.75
   x 10(6) km(2) of the Himalayan region. More than half a billion people
   in Nepal, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh are directly or indirectly
   dependent on the water resources of the GEM rivers. These river basins
   are characterized by diversified climatic patterns. Analyses of trends
   and persistence in precipitation over these river basins are necessary
   for sound water resources planning. Time series of annual precipitation
   for each of the 16 meteorological subdivisions covering the three river
   basins were examined for trends using the Mann-Kendall rank statistic,
   Student's t-test and regression analysis, and for persistence using
   first order autocorrelation analysis. Results indicate that
   precipitation in the Ganges basin is by-and-large stable. Precipitation
   in one subdivision in the Brahmaputra basin shows a decreasing trend and
   another shows an increasing trend. One of the three subdivisions in the
   Meghna basin shows a decreasing trend while another shows an increasing
   trend. Markovian persistence is not present in the precipitation series
   in the Ganges basin but it is present in two common subdivisions in the
   Brahmaputra and Meghna basins.},

Abstract = {A dense monthly precipitation dataset of Ireland and Northern Ireland
   was homogenized with several modern homogenization methods. The
   efficiency of these homogenizations was tested by examining the
   similarity of homogenization results both in the real data
   homogenization and in the homogenization of a simulated dataset. The
   analysis of homogenization results shows that the real dataset is
   characterized by a large number of, but mostly small, nonclimatic
   biases, and a moderate reduction of such biases can be achieved with
   homogenization. Finally, a combination of the ACMANT and Climatol
   homogenization results was applied to improve the data accuracy before
   the trend calculations. These two methods were selected for their proven
   high accuracy, missing data tolerance and ability to complete time
   series via the infilling of missing values before the trend
   calculations. Metadata were used within the Climatol method. To
   facilitate this analysis the study area was split into smaller climatic
   regions by using the Ward clustering method. Five climatic zones
   consistent with the known spatial patterns of precipitation in Ireland
   were established. Linear regression fitting and the Mann-Kendall test
   were applied. Low frequency fluctuations were also examined by applying
   a Gaussian filter. The results show that the precipitation amount
   generally increases in the study area, particularly in the northwestern
   region. The most significant increasing trends for the whole study
   period (1941-2010) are found for late winter and spring precipitation,
   as well as for the annual totals. In the period from the early 1970s the
   increase of precipitation is general in all seasons of the year except
   in winter, but the statistical significance of this increase is weak.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine trends in gauging stations in
   Slovakia to support integrated water resources management in the
   country. We investigated 487 stations during the period 1981-2013.
   Monthly rainfall trends were detected by non-parametric Mann-Kendall and
   Spearman's Rho statistical test. Precipitation trends show high
   variability. The precipitation time series in Slovakia in gauging
   stations in particular have an increasing trend, especially in the month
   of July. Achieved results can be the basis for the development of river
   basin management plans and within the framework of risk assessment they
   will address all aspects of environmental risk management focusing on
   prevention, protection, preparedness (including forecasts and early
   warning systems) and taking into account the characteristics of each
   river basin. It is highly desirable but also feasible to limit the risk
   of adverse consequences, especially for human health and life, the
   environment, the cultural heritage, the economic activity and the
   infrastructure associated with extreme hydrological phenomena in the
   river basins. However, measures to reduce these risks if they are to be
   effective must be as far as possible coordinated throughout the river
   basin.},

Abstract = {Iranian plateau is a seismically active region. Within this region,
   northwestern Iran is of high importance. Before proper planning for
   mitigating the earthquake-induced hazards can be achieved, it is
   necessary to identify high-risk areas in terms of susceptibility to
   earthquakes. In this study, landslide susceptibility in Miandoab Country
   was modeled using the so-called random forest algorithm (RFA) in MATLAB
   based on records acquired at 67 earthquake hotspots considering 9
   factors affecting the earthquake occurrence (i.e., height, slope,
   direction, distance from fault, distance from river, distance from road,
   land use, geology, and precipitation). Predictive power of the model and
   validity of its results were evaluated using relative operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC). The
   assessment results showed very good accuracy of the model (0.97). It was
   further found that digital height layer, geology, and distance from
   fault impose the largest contributions into earthquake potential. The
   results also showed that 53\%, 8.3\%, and 38.4\% of the study area were
   classified as being at low risk, moderate risk, and high risk of
   earthquake. Among other climatic elements, the precipitation exhibits
   the largest fluctuations; we proceeded to evaluate precipitation trends
   in the study area for a statistical period of 30 years. This was
   practiced by implementing Mann-Kendall nonparametric test in MATLAB.
   This subject-matter is especially important in Iran where the annual
   precipitation level is as low as 250 mm. The results showed that the
   precipitation follows an increasing trend in the region.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal trend and frequency analysis of precipitation in
   South-southern Nigeria (SSN)},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {57-72},
Abstract = {Precipitation is one of the key climatic parameters that have a
   significant impact on the spatial and temporal trends of available water
   resources in a region. Therefore, carrying out a long-term analysis on
   its seasonal and annual trends and variability is imperative for viable
   water resources management. This study investigates the seasonal and
   annual precipitation data for South-southern Nigeria (SSN) between 1951
   and 2016. Over the 66 yr period, SSN witnessed a region-wide decrease in
   annual and DJF, MAM and JJA seasonal precipitation; while in SON,
   precipitation was reduced in 81.2\% of the stations. On the regional
   level, station-specific trend analysis confirmed a region-wide decrease;
   however, a greater number of significant declines were found for annual
   and MAM precipitation records for all 6 states within SSN. The degree of
   wetness and dryness within the states indicate that all experienced more
   periods of extreme dryness than extreme wetness during the study
   duration. This may be attributed to evident changes in climate that are
   also reflected in the decreasing trends reported for the annual and
   seasonal timescales. The only significant cycle was detected at 1 yr
   timescale throughout the study period for precipitation time series in
   all the six states in SSN.. The major results of this study show that
   SSN may have challenges in securing the water required for agriculture
   and other domestic needs if adequate measures are not in place to fully
   harness other water sources within the crop-growing season of MAM.},

Title = {TRMM 3B43 Product-Based Spatial and Temporal Anatomy of Precipitation
   Trends: Global Perspective},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {192},

Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {This study harnessed some of the many opportunities provided by the TRMM
   3B43 data in order to generate maps illustrating the spatial and
   temporal distribution of significant linear rates of change of annual
   total precipitation for the surface of earth bounded by latitudes 50
   degrees S and 50 degrees N for the years 1998-2018 by applying
   pixel-based simple linear regression. These maps are valuable for many
   applications and should enhance our understanding of the global
   precipitation patterns and trigger more research in order to explain
   what has not been explained. It has been found that the whole study area
   had a mean significant linear rate of change of - 0.4 mm/year. Nearly
   half of its area had significant linear rates of increase with a mean of
   8.5 mm/year while the other half had significant linear rates of
   decrease with mean of - 7.6 mm/year. Landmass alone can be divided into
   nearly two halves; the first had significant linear rates of increase
   with a mean of 5.2 mm/year while the second had significant linear rates
   of decrease with mean of - 7.0 mm/year. Water areas alone also can
   nearly be divided into two halves; the first showed significant linear
   rates of increase with a mean of 9.6 mm/year while the second showed
   significant linear rates of decrease with mean of - 7.8 mm/year.
   Grouping the whole study area into six climatic zones and 21
   administrative land and water regions and applying pixel-based Tukey
   test showed that the obtained significant linear rates of change varied
   significantly among these climatic and administrative regions.},

Abstract = {In this study, the annual and seasonal changes in extreme precipitation
   indices were investigated in Northern Cyprus by using the non-parametric
   Mann-Kendal trend test and Sen's slope estimator. To this end, quality
   control of data procedure including estimation of missing data,
   detection of unreasonable values, and outliers were applied to 36 daily
   precipitation series to identify different errors. In order to test the
   homogeneity of the daily series, a two-step approach with four
   homogeneity tests and overall classification were used. The
   investigation of trends for extreme precipitation indices indicated that
   the trends were mostly nonsignificant and increasing in scale annually.
   On seasonal scale, the percentage of stations with increasing trend was
   almost the same with the percentage of stations with decreasing trend in
   autumn and spring. Besides, the upward trend was observed at more than
   77\% of the stations in winter with 11\% having significantly increasing
   trends. Generally, there was no spatial coherence as well as a mixed
   pattern of trends changing from station to station. (C) 2017 American

Abstract = {The trends of global precipitation in 1900-2005 are evaluated using a
   historical precipitation reconstruction and coupled model simulations,
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 3. A significant increasing trend in the
   global oceanic precipitation is identified in both the reconstruction
   and models. The trend from the reconstructed ocean precipitation is 0.04
   mm day (-1) over 100a (100 years) and is about twice that of the mean of
   all models. Over land, the spatial patterns of the trends from both the
   reconstruction and the models are similar to those shown in the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. Over
   the ocean, both reconstruction and models show positive trends in the
   equatorial and subpolar regions and negative trends over the subtropics.
   However, the trend magnitude and the locations of the trend peaks are
   different near the equator (10 degrees S to 10 degrees N) between the
   reconstruction and the models. CMIP5 future simulations for the global
   mean project a continuing and stronger precipitation trend in the 21st
   century than the 20th century. Citation: Ren L., P. Arkin, T. M. Smith,

   extreme rainfall were observed during autumn (MAM), with positive trends
   across most of the mid and upper URB and negative trends in the low URB.
   In the upper URB, negative trends in the frequency of extremes were also
   found during spring (SON) and summer (DJF). Overall, there was a
   reduction in the number of consecutive wet days (CWD), particularly
   significant in the upper URB and the northern half of the mid URB.
   Additionally, the upper URB experienced an overall increase in the
   duration of consecutive dry days (CDD).},

Title = {Seasonal variability of future extreme precipitation and associated
   trends across the Contiguous US},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Global climate models and long-term observational records point to the
   intensification of extreme precipitation due to global warming. Such
   intensification has direct implications for worsening floods and damage
   to life and property. This study investigates the projected trends
   (2015-2100) in precipitation climatology and daily extremes using
   Community Earth System Model Version 2 large ensemble (CESM2-LE)
   simulations at regional and seasonal scales. Specifically, future
   extreme precipitation is examined in National Climate Assessment (NCA)
   regions over the Contiguous United States using SSP3-7.0 (Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathway). Extreme precipitation is analyzed in terms of
   daily maximum precipitation and simple daily intensity index (SDII)
   using Mann-Kendall (5\% significance level) and Theil-Sen (TS)
   regression. The most substantial increases occur in the highest
   precipitation values (95(th)) during summer and winter clustered in the
   Midwest and Northeast, respectively, according to long-term extreme
   trends evaluated in quantiles (i.e., 25, 50, 75, and 95(th)). Seasonal
   climatology projections suggest wetting and drying patterns, with
   wetting in spring and winter in the eastern areas and drying during
   summer in the Midwest. Lower quantiles in the central U.S. are expected
   to remain unchanged, transitioning to wetting patterns in the fall due
   to heavier precipitation. Winter positive trends (at a 5\% significance
   level) are most prevalent in the Northeast and Southeast, with an
   overall ensemble agreement on such trends. In spring, these trends are
   predominantly found in the Midwest. In the Northeast and Northern Great
   Plains, the intensity index shows a consistent wetting pattern in
   spring, winter, and summer, whereas a drying pattern is projected in the
   Midwest during summer. Normalized regional changes are a function of
   indices, quantiles, and seasons. Specifically, seasonal accumulations
   present larger changes (similar to 30\% and above) in summer and lower
   changes (< similar to 20\%) in winter in the Southern Great Plains and
   the Southwestern U.S. Examining projections of extreme precipitation
   change across distinct quantiles provides insights into the projected
   variability of regional precipitation regimes over the coming decades.},

Title = {Long-term trend analysis on total and extreme precipitation over Shasta
   Dam watershed},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {California's interconnected water system is one of themost advanced
   water management systems in the world, and understanding of long-term
   trends in atmospheric and hydrologic behavior has increasingly being
   seen as vital to its future well-being. Knowledge of such trends is
   hampered by the lack of long-period observation data and the uncertainty
   surrounding future projections of atmospheric models. This study
   examines historical precipitation trends over the Shasta Dam watershed
   (SDW), which lies upstream of one of the most important components of
   California's water system, Shasta Dam, using a dynamical
   downscalingmethodology that can produce atmospheric data at fine
   time-space scales. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is
   employed to reconstruct 159 years of long-term hourly precipitation data
   at 3 km spatial resolution over SDW using the 20th Century Reanalysis
   Version 2c dataset. Trend analysis on this data indicates a significant
   increase in total precipitation aswell as a growing intensity of extreme
   events such as 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72-hour storms over the period of
   1851 to 2010. The turning point of the increasing trend and no
   significant trend periods is found to be 1940 for annual precipitation
   and the period of 1950 to 1960 for extreme precipitation using the
   sequential Mann-Kendall test. Based on these analysis, we find the
   trends at the regional scale do not necessarily apply to the
   watershed-scale. The sharp increase in the variability of annual
   precipitation since 1970s is also detected, which implies an increase in
   the occurrence of extremewet and dry conditions. These results
   informlongterm planning decisions regarding the future of Shasta Dam and
   California's water system. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Atmospheric mercury (Hg) measurements from across Canada were compiled
   and analysed as part of a national Hg science assessment. Here we update
   long-term trends of Hg in air and precipitation, and present more
   extensive measurements on patterns and trends in speciated Hg species
   (gaseous elemental mercury-GEM, reactive gaseous mercury-RGM, and total
   particulate mercury on particles < 2.5 mu m-TPM2.5) at several sites. A
   spatial analysis across Canada revealed higher air concentrations and
   wet deposition of Hg in the vicinity of local and regional emission
   sources, and lower air concentrations of Hg at mid-latitude maritime
   sites compared to continental sites. Diel and seasonal patterns in
   atmospheric GEM, RGM and TPM2.5 concentrations reflected differences in
   patterns of anthropogenic emissions, photo-induced surface emissions,
   chemistry, deposition and mixing. Concentrations of GEM decreased at
   rates ranging from -0.9\% to -3.3\% per year at all sites where
   measurements began in the 1990s. Concentrations of total Hg in
   precipitation declined up to 3.7\% yr(-1). Trends in RGM and TPM2.5 were
   less clear due to shorter measurement periods and low concentrations,
   however, in spring at the high Arctic site (Alert) when RGM and TPM2.5
   concentrations were high, concentrations of both increased by 7\%-10\%
   per year.},

Title = {Long-term trend and interannual variability of precipitation-use
   efficiency in Eurasian grasslands},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {130},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) is an important ecosystem indicator
   of the efficiency of carbon-water conversion. The trend and interannual
   variation of precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) response to climatic
   factors provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how Eurasian
   grasslands adapt to climate change. However, the long-term trends and
   regulating factors of PUE in Eurasian grasslands at the continental
   scale are still unclear. Here, we integrated long-term Global Inventory
   Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI), field surveys of aboveground net primary production (ANPP)
   and meteorological datasets during 1982-2015 to reveal the temporal
   variations and controls of PUE in Eurasian grasslands. We found that
   there was an overall uptrend of PUE (3 x 10-3 g C m- 2 mm- 1/10 yr) in
   Eurasian grasslands. The greatest increasing trends of PUE was found in
   forest steppe at the rate of 13 x 10-3 g C m- 2 mm- 1/10 yr, while
   greatest decreasing trend presented in alpine steppe at the rate of -2.6
   x 10-3 g C m- 2 mm- 1/10 yr. The PUE showed linearly decreasing patterns
   with precipitation at the biome and continental scales, while it was
   uncorrelated with temperature at the continental scale and showed
   diverse patterns of linear increase, concavedown and no correlation with
   temperature for different biomes. The temporal variation of PUE was
   mainly controlled by precipitation in Eurasian grasslands. This result
   further revealed that climatic factors shaped the temporal pattern of
   PUE by the cascading effects networks of climatic factors (precipitation
   and temperature) vapor pressure deficit (VPD) - leaf area index (LAI) -
   ANPP - PUE (CVLP-CENet). This study identified the longterm trends,
   interannual variations and controls of PUE in Eurasian grasslands over
   the past three decades, and provided crucial insights into understanding
   grassland ecosystems dynamics and response to climate change.},

Abstract = {This work presents a study of variability and trends of extreme
   precipitation events in northeast Algeria using a high-resolution
   gridded dataset. To this end, 10 extreme precipitation indices were
   computed over a daily gridded precipitation dataset with a spatial
   resolution of 1x1 km from 33 series of weather observatories, covering
   the period from 1970 to 2010. The processes involving the reconstruction
   of the missing data and gridding were applied based on the approach of
   creating reference values (RV), allowing for a comprehensive quality
   control of the original data while reporting and deleting suspicious
   values that do not correspond to the natural spatial and temporal
   distribution of daily precipitation. These RV were used to complete a
   reconstructed dataset without missing values, based on the cleaned data
   series. Then, it was used to create the high-resolution gridded dataset
   over northeast Algeria. In view of the obtained results, a general
   increasing gradient of the extreme precipitation indices from south to
   north was noted, particularly at the coast and at high-altitude regions.
   Furthermore, upward trends in extreme intensity and frequency
   precipitation indices, such as PRCPTOT, SDII, RX1day, RX5day, R10mm,
   R20mm, CWD, R95p, and R99p were observed, except for the consecutive thy
   days (CDD) index, which showed a remarkable decrease. However, most of
   the estimated trends were not statistically significant at .05 levels.},

Title = {Trends of extreme precipitation and associated synoptic patterns over

Abstract = {This paper investigates the extreme precipitation events in the southern
   Iberian Peninsula (Andalusia) using 86 stations with daily precipitation
   records for the period 1955-2006.
   Seasonal (excluding summer) and monthly trends were established for
   different extreme-precipitation indices. Both the stability and the
   significance of the trends were examined. The findings indicate a
   significant spatial and seasonal variability. The most noteworthy
   results were found in winter, with a predominance of decreasing trends
   for intensity indices in western and central (CW) Andalusia, whereas
   positive trends appeared in the south-eastern (SE) zone. These marked
   differences in the sign of trends in short distances evidence the
   importance of using a dense network of stations for regional analysis of
   extremes. Overall, spring analysis reveals a negative trend in the
   intensity indices, especially in March. In autumn, the significance of
   the trends proved lower in comparison to winter and spring, and only
   September presented significant increasing trends in intensity indices.
   The synoptic patterns associated with heavy precipitation events were
   compared with two large-circulation indices affecting the precipitation
   over Andalusia (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO, and the Western
   Mediterranean Oscillation, WeMO). This analysis was made for the two
   sub-areas of Andalusia separately. The synoptic patterns at the surface
   and 500-hPa level were determined by the use of a principal component
   analysis (PCA) in T-mode coupled with clustering techniques. The
   seasonal distribution and the location of disturbances of the
   atmospheric patterns found were clearly differentiated in the two areas.
   The tendencies found for the indices agree with the changes in the
   frequency of the main synoptic patterns for each area.
   Furthermore, most of these synoptic patterns were related to highly
   negative WeMO values. Conversely, only some of the patterns associated
   with heavy rainfall in the western and central area presented
   significant negative values of the NAO index. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {General dry trends according to the standardized precipitation
   evapotranspiration index in mainland Chile},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Droughts are one of the main challenges affecting humanity in a global
   change context. Due to its spatial configuration, Chile experiences
   droughts of different severities, from arid to humid climates, ranging
   from sea level to elevations above 6,000 m above sea level (a.s.l.), but
   it is still unknown how this phenomenon behaves in distribution,
   duration and intensity. The goal of this study is to identify how
   droughts have affected the different climate regions of the country
   between 1979 and 2019. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
   Index (SPEI), calculated for March and September, at the end of the
   humid season in the north and center-south of the country, respectively,
   and calculated at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month, allowed to determine the
   trends of the drought severity in a 5 x 5 km grid between 1979 and 2019.
   We found that negative and significant trends, indicating dry
   conditions, appear mainly in the Andes above 2,000 m a.s.l., where the
   main water reservoirs are located, affecting all climate types, except
   Mediterranean ones between 33 degrees S and 38 degrees S. The SPEI
   indicates general trends towards drier conditions across various
   elevations and climate types, with more pronounced negative trends in
   the north and central regions and some positive trends in the south.
   These trends suggest a significant impact on water availability, and
   highlight the need for focused policy initiatives to combat drought
   effects and manage water resources effectively. These findings are of
   main interest to Chile, one of the world's leading producers of lithium
   and copper, with both industries requiring substantial amounts of water
   for extraction and processing, demanding high water availability in a
   drier territory.},

Abstract = {Changes in precipitation patterns might have deleterious effects on
   population health. We used data from the Uganda National Panel Survey
   from 2009 to 2012 (n = 3,223 children contributing 5,013 assessments) to
   evaluate the link between rainfall and undernutrition in children under
   age 5 years. We considered 3 outcomes (underweight, wasting, and
   stunting) and measured precipitation using household-reported drought
   and deviations from long-term precipitation trends measured by
   satellite. We specified multilevel logistic regression models with
   random effects for the community, village, and individual. Underweight
   (13\%), wasting (4\%), and stunting (33\%) were common. Reported drought
   was associated with underweight (marginal risk ratio (RR) = 1.18, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.35) in adjusted analyses. Positive
   annual deviations (greater rainfall) from long-term precipitation trends
   were protective against underweight (marginal RR per 50-mm increase =
   0.94, 95\% CI: 0.92, 0.97) and wasting (marginal RR per 50-mm increase =
   0.93, 95\% CI: 0.87, 0.98) but not stunting (marginal RR per 50-mm
   increase = 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.98, 1.01). Precipitation was associated with
   measures of acute but not chronic malnutrition using both objective and
   subjective measures of exposure. Sudden reductions in rainfall are
   likely to have acute adverse effects on child nutritional status.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse spatial and temporal homogeneity
   and trends in seasonal and annual precipitation and their fluctuations
   during 1957-2016 in Iran. For testing homogeneity, the
   Pettitt-Whitney-Mann, the Standard Normal Homogeneity or Alexandersson's
   SNHT, Buishand's and the Von Neumann tests were used and for trend
   analysis, Mann-Kendall and Sequential Mann-Kendall tests were used.
   Homogeneity tests showed that most of the seasonal and annual
   precipitation time series were homogeneous and the change point was
   detected only at a few stations. Results indicated that in general,
   there was an upward trend during 1957-1986, followed by a significant
   downward trend during 1987-2016. The sequential Mann-Kendall test
   detected several possible change points over time, although most of them
   were found statistically non-significant at 95\% confidence level.
   Upward and downward trends started in annual and seasonal precipitation
   after 1960 and 1990, respectively, at most stations, except in spring.
   In spring, an upward trend started after 1990 at some stations which
   showed a shift in precipitation from winter to spring. Also, the Sen's
   slope estimator indicated a higher downward trend in the northern parts
   of Iran. Two findings are worthy of note based on the results of this
   study. First, in general, a significant downward trend occurred in the
   whole country after1990. Second, a shift in precipitation from winter to
   spring was detected at some stations in different homogeneous regions.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is one of the most important climatic elements that influence
   both the spatial and temporal water availability. Therefore,
   identification of its trend over years is vital for detection of extreme
   climatic changes. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
   variability of precipitation in flood source areas of Kelantan river
   basin by detecting precipitation flood changes in the temporal structure
   for the period of 1984-2014. A total of 17 rain gage stations with at
   least 25 years' records in the temporal structure for the period
   1984-2014 were selected. For the AMF data, 4 gauging stations were
   selected for the analysis. Mann-Kendall and Sen slope estimator tests
   were used to detect possible precipitation trend. This resulted in the
   detection of non-statistically significant trend in the annual maximum
   series of 24-hr precipitation in 12 of the 17 selected rain gauge
   locations and statistically significant trend in 5 locations for the
   period under study. Whereas, the AMF series signaled significance at 5\%
   level in all the stations. This may be as a result of watershed
   characteristics such as land use changes soil, topography, of the study
   area which needs to be studied in detail. (C) 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

Abstract = {Recent news on the occurrence of off-seasonal natural disasters, such as
   pre-monsoon drought and post-monsoon flooding in India and particularly
   in the peninsular region, highlight the urgent need to look at the
   patterns of change in seasonal extremes at the local level. Kerala, the
   south-western state of the Indian peninsula, comprising of a total of
   six gridded areas, was chosen for this study focusing on the variability
   and changes in rainfall extremes in the different seasons. Since other
   studies by the authors have focused on the monsoon season, this paper
   considers the winter, spring and autumn seasons only. A set of indices
   derived from the daily rainfall time series is defined and used to
   examine the changes in extreme rainfall through assessing long-term
   trends by non-parametric Mann-Kendall technique. The trends are
   determined over the period of 1954-2003, which are also tested for
   significance. The results show that there are large intra-regional
   differences in the trends in different seasons. Local changes were found
   different from the large spatial scale averages in Kerala. Winter and
   autumn extreme rainfall were found having an increasing tendency with
   statistically significant changes in some regions indicating more
   occurrences of winter and autumn floods. On the other hand the spring
   seasonal extreme rainfall showed decreasing trends, which together with
   increasing frequency of the dry days is mainly affecting the total
   seasonal precipitation, which mainly point towards the vulnerability of
   Kerala to increasing probability of water scarcity in the pre-monsoon
   time and a delaying monsoon onset. Overall, the results of this study
   are good indicators of local climate changes over the five decades that
   will assist in seasonal forecasting and risk management. (C) 2009

Abstract = {In this study, three kinds of hourly precipitation series with the
   spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees are used to analyze the climatological
   features and trends of extreme precipitation during the period of
   1979-2012 in Beijing, China. The results show that: (1) the spatial
   distribution of median annual precipitation, with a range from 500 to
   825 mm, is similar to that of local topography, which increases from the
   northwest to the southeast. Taking the urban area as a centre, the
   inter-annual precipitation in the Beijing area displays an outward
   decreasing tendency at the maximum rate of 125 mm per decade (125 mm x
   10 a(-1)); (2) extreme precipitation amount, which accounts for 40-48\%
   of total precipitation amount, has a similar spatial distribution to
   average annual precipitation; (3) the spatial distribution of extreme
   precipitation days and threshold estimated as the upper 95 percentile
   are significantly different from that of extreme precipitation, with
   maximum values concentrated on the urban area and the eastern mountain
   area, and minimum values in northwest; (4) extreme precipitation days
   (Ex\_pd95) show an opposite distribution to extreme precipitation
   threshold (Ex\_pv95), indicating that areas with greater precipitation
   threshold may has less precipitation days, and vice versa; (5) an
   apparent spatiotemporal decreasing tendency is detected in extreme
   precipitation amount. The downward tendencies are also found in extreme
   precipitation threshold. Unlike Ex\_pv95, in most of the study area,
   Ex\_pd95 is virtually unchanged; (6) downward trends of extreme
   precipitation is slightly smaller than that of annual precipitation, and
   the reducing amplitude of north-eastern areas are much higher than the
   areas in the southwest.},

Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {409-421},
Abstract = {This research focuses on long-term patterns of climatic variability,
   such as precipitation. Rainfall trends in the Ajmer region were assessed
   using the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Sen's slope estimator, and the
   innovative trend analysis (ITA) technique on various time scales.
   Monthly precipitation data were used for the period of 121 years, i.e.,
   1901-2021. Trends (1901-2021) were assessed at the 5\% significant level
   using a statistical trend analysis method called the Mann-Kendall test.
   Mann-Kendall trend analysis result reveals an insignificant increase in
   the region of Ajmer District. At any time, series across the Ajmer
   District, there is no clear increase or decrease trend. According to the
   results of the ITA test, all four seasons and annual trends indicate
   decreasing. Almost all the significant trends identified using the M-K
   method were excellently recognised by the ITA method. The finding of the
   study will be useful to understand the risks and vulnerabilities of
   seasonal and annual precipitation under climate change scenarios in the

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The present study performs the spatial and temporal trend analysis of
   the annual and seasonal time-series of a set of uniformly distributed
   249 stations precipitation data across the state of North Carolina,
   United States over the period of 1950-2009. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test,
   the Theil-Sen approach (TSA) and the Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test
   were applied to quantify the significance of trend, magnitude of trend,
   and the trend shift respectively. Regional (mountain, piedmont and
   coastal) precipitation trends were also analyzed using the
   above-mentioned tests. Prior to the application of statistical tests,
   the pre-whitening technique was used to eliminate the effect of
   autocorrelation of precipitation data series. The application of the
   above-mentioned procedures has shown very notable statewide increasing
   trend for winter and decreasing trend for fall precipitation. Statewide
   mixed (increasing/decreasing) trend has been detected in annual, spring,
   and summer precipitation time series. Significant trends (confidence
   level >= 95\%) were detected only in 8, 7, 4 and 10 nos. of stations
   (out of 249 stations) in winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively.
   Magnitude of the highest increasing (decreasing) precipitation trend was
   found about 4 mm/season (-4.50 mm/season) in fall (summer) season.
   Annual precipitation trend magnitude varied between -5.50 mm/year and 9
   mm/year. Regional trend analysis found increasing precipitation in
   mountain and coastal regions in general except during the winter.
   Piedmont region was found to have increasing trends in summer and fall,
   but decreasing trend in winter, spring and on an annual basis. The SQMK
   test on ``trend shift analysis{''} identified a significant shift during
   1960-70 in most parts of the state. Finally, the comparison between
   winter (summer) precipitations with the North Atlantic Oscillation
   (Southern Oscillation) indices concluded that the variability and trend
   of precipitation can be explained by the Oscillation indices for North
   Carolina. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Positive trends in annual rainfall in the La Plata Basin (LPB), south of
   20 degrees S observed in the last four decades of the twentieth century
   were not reversed and became more statistically significant when
   calculated until 2005. These trends were part of a more general change
   in the monthly precipitation distribution including extreme
   precipitation. Precipitation in dry and extremely dry months (below the
   35th percentile) has been decreasing in the whole LPB region south of 22
   degrees S. On the contrary, precipitation in the above normal (between
   the 65th and 90th percentile) and the extremely high rainfall (above the
   90th percentile) ranges has been increasing accounting for most of the
   annual precipitation trends. More than a steady trend, there has been an
   abrupt change in extreme monthly precipitation concentrated between 1977
   and 1983. The analysis of intensity and frequency of extreme events was
   done fitting Generalized Extreme Values (GEV) and Poisson distributions.
   Each distribution was fitted with and without trends in the location
   parameter and tested to determine the best fit in each case. The regions
   where GEV with a positive trend was the best fit coincide with areas
   affected by extensive floods during the last decades. Spatially
   aggregated results highlight the signal of change towards higher maximum
   monthly precipitations for a wide span of return periods. The
   atmospheric circulation associated with cases where extreme monthly
   precipitation was observed in most of the stations was studied through
   the integrated water vapour transport in the lower troposphere and its
   associated divergence. During warm months, an intense northern low-level
   water vapour flow with two convergence nuclei, one over eastern
   Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay, and the other over western
   Argentina, along with a weakened south Atlantic Convergence Zone was
   associated with the more extreme precipitation months favouring the
   occurrence of Mesoscale Convective Systems. Copyright (c) 2011 Royal

Abstract = {The Svalbard archipelago, in the Atlantic-Arctic region, has been
   affected by a strong increase in precipitation in the last decades, with
   major potential impacts for the cryosphere, biogeochemical cycles, and
   the ecosystems. Ny-\& Aring;lesund (79 degrees N), in the northwest part
   of Svalbard, hosts invaluable meteorological records widely used by many
   researchers. Among the observed parameters, the amount of precipitation
   is subject to large biases, mainly due to the wellknown precipitation
   gauges undercatch during windy conditions. The purpose of this study is
   to investigate if the observed trend of precipitation in Ny-Alesund in
   the 1975-2022 period was real and how it was impacted by the gauge
   undercatch. We applied several correction factors developed in the last
   decades, based on local wind speed and temperature. We forced these
   corrections with 12-hourly precipitation data from the Ny-Alesund
   weather station. Taking the period 1975-2022, the trend of precipitation
   increased from 3.8 mm yr(-1) in the observations to 4.5 mm yr(-1) (+/-
   0.2) after the corrections, mainly due to enhanced snowfall in
   November-January months. Taking the most recent 40-yr period
   (1983-2022), the amount of precipitation still increased by 3.8 mm
   yr(-1) in the observations, but only by 2.6 mm yr(-1) (+/- 0.5) after
   the corrections. The recent observed trend of precipitation stays large
   due to an increase of wet snowfall and rainfall that are measured more
   efficiently by the precipitation gauge. This result shows the need of
   applying correction factors when using precipitation gauge data,
   especially in regions exhibiting large interannual changes of weather
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The exploration of precipitation data trends using innovative analysis
   methods is anticipated to offer significant contributions to
   sustainability across various domains, including water resources
   management, agricultural planning, climate change understanding,
   environmental protection, risk assessment, and preparedness. This study
   employs an improved visualization of the innovative trend analysis
   (IV-ITA) method for detecting annual and seasonal trends in
   precipitation variables across 194 stations in Turkey over the period
   1969-2020. The outcomes derived from the IV-ITA method were further
   juxtaposed with the results obtained from the classical Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test. Using the MK test, statistically significant increasing
   trends were detected in the annual pattern along the northern coasts of
   Turkey. Based on the results obtained from the IV-ITA, substantial
   decreasing trends were identified in the basins within the Southeastern
   Anatolia Region of Turkey. Conversely, an increasing trend was observed
   in the basins situated in the northwest. It was also established that an
   increasing trend was observed throughout Turkey, except for some
   stations in the low-data group. The most significant increasing trend
   was noted in the basins along the southern coastline, characterized by
   the prevalence of the Mediterranean climate. In the high-data group, an
   increase of up to 50\% was noted along the southwest coast. Upon
   comparing the outcomes derived from the IV-ITA method with those
   obtained using the MK test, it becomes apparent that the IV-ITA yields
   significantly more detailed results than the MK test. Additionally,
   applying the IV-ITA method in climate-sensitive regions and basins is
   envisioned to enhance the accuracy of assessments, foster a sustainable
   environment, and improve the effective management of water resources.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal characteristics of different-grade extreme precipitation
   evolution detected by innovative trend analysis},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 31},
Abstract = {Understanding the changing characteristics of extreme precipitation (EP)
   events is essential for formulating effective adaptive measures for
   water resource and flood hazard management. Although much research
   focused on annual extreme precipitation variations, there has been
   little comparison of changing characteristics of extreme precipitation
   in different grades and seasons. To this end, this study investigated
   extreme precipitation variations from multiple perspectives in Tai Lake
   Plain (TLP) during 1966-2015 at spatial (36 stations) and temporal (4
   seasons) scales, using an innovative trend analysis (ITA) method with a
   significant test. Meanwhile, the trends were evaluated separately for
   low (< 30th), medium (30th-70th), and high (> 70th) grades of extreme
   precipitation. The ITA method was compared with two traditional trend
   analysis methods of linear regression (LR) analysis and Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test. The results indicate that (1) ITA detected a significant
   upward trend in annual EP indices (except consecutive dry days (CDD)) at
   the 99\% confidence level and similar significant upward trends in
   summer and winter EPs, while downward trends in spring and autumn in
   most stations; (2) a relatively stronger intensifying trend of EPs
   occurred in the southeast and northeast of TLP in summer and winter; (3)
   from low to high grade, the annual and summer upward trends have
   continuously strengthened, whereas the downward trends in spring or
   autumn became weaker to an extent; and (4) significant trends (in three
   to eight EP indices) that cannot be observed by LR and MK can be
   effectively identified using ITA. So ITA showed advantages of revealing
   the hidden trends in climatic time series. These results by ITA can
   provide an informed reference for flood (or drought) risk management in
   different seasons and areas across the TLP region.},

Abstract = {The changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme climatic events
   bring about many important problems in terms of social, economic and
   environmental. Especially, it is very important to inquire the

   researchers at global, regional and local scales in recent years. This
   study is about the temporal variability of extreme precipitation of 4
   meteorology station (Konya, Karaman, Aksaray, Nigde) on Konya Closed
   Basin in Turkey. Trend analysis of extreme precipitations was conducted
   by means of the Spearman's Rho (SR), Mann-Kendall (MK) and Innovative
   Sen Trend test. According to the results of trend methods,
   non-significant decreasing trends are observed in extreme precipitation
   data of Aksaray, Karaman and Nigde meteorology stations while
   non-significant increasing trend is shown only in Konya meteorology

Abstract = {Long-term variations and trends in a wide range of statistics for daily
   precipitation characteristics in terms of intensity, frequency and
   duration in Finland were analysed using precipitation records during
   1908-2008 from 3 meteorological stations in the south (Kaisaniemi),
   centre (Kajaani) and north (Sodankyla). Although precipitation days in
   northern part were more frequent than in central and southern parts,
   daily precipitation intensity in the south was generally higher than
   those in the centre and north of the country. Annual sum of very light
   precipitation (0 mm < daily precipitation <= long-term 50th percentile
   of daily precipitation more than 0 mm) significantly (p < 0.05)
   decreased over time, with the highest rate in northern Finland. These
   decreasing trends might be the result of significant increases in
   frequency of days with very light precipitation at all the stations,
   with the highest and lowest rates in northern and southern Finland,
   respectively. Ratio of annual total precipitation to number of
   precipitation days also declined in Finland over 1908-2008, with a
   decreasing north to south gradient. However, annual duration indices of
   daily precipitation revealed no statistically significant trends at any
   station. Daily precipitation characteristics showed significant
   relationships with various well-known atmospheric circulation patterns
   (ACPs). In particular, the East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR) pattern in
   summer was the most influential ACP negatively associated with different
   daily precipitation intensity, frequency and duration indices at all
   three stations studied.},

Title = {Analysis of Variation Trends in Precipitation in an Upstream Catchment

Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {We analyzed the variation trends in precipitation according to the
   observed data in the Shaying River catchment, upstream of the Huai River
   from 1951 to 2010, using the linear regression method and Mann-Kendall
   test. Further study was made by introducing R/S analysis, and the
   corresponding Hurst Exponent was estimated to predict the future trends
   of rainfall. The results suggested that the changing trends in
   precipitation for different time series in the whole catchment were
   relatively complex and not obvious. The annual precipitation showed a
   slightly increasing trend over the past 60 years, and in the future it
   would be antipersistent. For the 38 rainfall stations, the trends in
   spring and autumn precipitation time series were mostly negative; on the
   contrary, the trends in summer and winter were mostly positive. The
   results also indicated that the annual precipitation series showed
   positive trends in the northern region and negative trends in the
   southern region. Moreover, the relationships of H-Z and H-beta. of the
   38 stations were analyzed. The results indicated that the greater the
   absolute values of Z the stronger the persistent nature. Meanwhile, for
   most of the H values were close to 0.5, the randomness of the future
   trends could not be ignored.},

Abstract = {Daily precipitation patterns over Switzerland are investigated by
   rotated and unrotated principal component analysis for the periods
   1901-1990 (with 113 continuously operating rain-gauge sites) and
   1961-1990 (with 304 sites). Empirical orthogonal functions are utilized
   to homogenize the precipitation series and to optimally transform the
   113 series of the long-term record into a few variables. Several
   statistically significant linear trends are detected. This includes, in
   particular, a wintertime increase in precipitation by up to 30 per cent
   per 100 years in the western and northern parts of Switzerland. This
   trend is statistically significant at the 90 per cent level. In most
   parts of southeastern Switzerland, winter precipitation increased as
   well but by a smaller rate and at a slightly lower statistical
   significance level. For the period 1961-1990, precipitation amounts
   increased in most subregions and all seasons with the exception of
   summer.
   A statistical model is formulated in order to isolate the contributions
   to the observed precipitation trends that are related to changes in
   either the frequency or the precipitation activity of Alpine weather
   classes. It is demonstrated that the observed precipitation trends
   cannot be interpreted ba ed upon changing frequencies of weather classes
   (the observed changes would in fact lead to drier wintertime
   conditions), but are rather dominated by the tendency of most
   rain-producing weather types to produce more rain. Some physical
   mechanisms that could account for this unexpected result are also
   discussed. (C) 1997 by the Royal Meteorological Society.

Abstract = {Northeast China (NEC) is one of the vital commercial grain bases in
   China and it has suffered from soil erosion due to prolonged cultivation
   and lack of protection. To determine long-term trends of precipitation
   and rainfall erosivity over NEC during the latest decades, daily
   precipitation for the entire year during 1961-2020 and hourly
   precipitation for the warm season (May to September) during 1971-2020
   were collected for 192 and 126 stations, respectively. Three seasons,
   including the cold season (October to April), early warm season (May to
   June), and late warm season (July to September) were divided according
   to the combination of precipitation and vegetation. Results demonstrate:
   (1) Daily precipitation reveals total precipitation and rainfall
   erosivity in the cold season and early warm season increase
   significantly at relative rates of 3.1\% similar to 6.1\% compared with
   the average during 1961-2020, and those in the late warm season decrease
   insignificantly. (2) Hourly precipitation reveals storms occurring in
   the early and late warm seasons have undergone significant increasing
   changes, which shift towards longer storm duration, larger amount, peak
   intensity, kinetic energy, and rainfall erosivity during 1971-2020.
   Moreover, the frequency of extreme storms increased. (3) Rainfall
   erosivities estimated from daily precipitation during 1971-2020 increase
   insignificantly for the early and late warm season, whereas those from
   hourly precipitation increase significantly (6.1\% and 5.5\%,
   respectively), which indicates daily precipitation may not be able to
   capture the trend fully under the warming background, and precipitation
   at higher resolutions than the daily scale is necessary to detect trends
   of rainfall erosivity more accurately.

Abstract = {Southeast Brazil (SE Brazil) is the most densely populated region in
   Brazil. Previous studies have shown evidence of positive trends in
   average precipitation and extreme events in a few locations, suggesting
   the increase in rainfall-related hazards with potential impacts to
   urbanized areas of SE Brazil. This study provides a comprehensive
   analysis of the spatial variability of trends in extreme precipitation
   over SE Brazil focusing on regional and local scales. We examine two
   daily rainfall datasets with more than 70 years of data: individual
   stations and gridded observed precipitation data. Our results indicate
   that the frequency of both rainy days and extreme daily precipitation
   events have increased in Sao Paulo state. Conversely, precipitation has
   become more concentrated in fewer events in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito
   Santo states where both data sets indicate positive trends in the
   intensity of extreme daily rainfall. The increases in frequency and
   intensity of extreme events have both contributed to positive trends in
   total seasonal and average daily precipitation over Sao Paulo.
   Additionally, the individual stations indicate negative trends in the
   number of light rainy days over large urbanized areas in the state of
   Sao Paulo. The spatial patterns of trends indicate that they are
   influenced by the proximity of large urban centres and topographic
   features, and also suggest variations and changes in the major climatic
   systems affecting precipitation regimes over SE.},

Abstract = {Large flood events in recent years in the state of Wisconsin, USA raised
   a question of whether high precipitation events are on the rise. The
   objective of the research was to examine temporal and spatial patterns
   of extreme precipitation in Wisconsin during 1950-2006. The daily
   precipitation data used in the study were created by researchers at the
   University of Wisconsin-Madison using spatial interpolation of weather
   stations data across the state to a grid mesh with a spatial resolution
   of 8 km. For extreme precipitation indices, we calculated 99th, 95th,
   90th, 85th, and 80th percentiles of daily total precipitation (>1 mm) in
   a year and the number of days per year with daily precipitation
   exceeding 10 mm, 20 mm, and 50 mm. We also conducted the Mann-Kendall
   test for trend, examined how geographical heterogeneity varied over
   time, and built quantile regression models for annual summer
   precipitation. Main findings include the following: the temporal trend
   of extreme precipitation varied widely across the state; the highest
   percentile index showed an increasing trend over the largest area,
   whereas indices of less extreme precipitation tended to generally
   decrease; extreme precipitation tended to show more dispersed and skewed
   spatial patterns than annual total precipitation. Overall, indices
   related to frequency showed more similar spatial and temporal trends to
   total precipitation than magnitude indices.},

Abstract = {Thirteen years (1980-1992) of precipitation chemistry data from 58
   National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network
   (NADP/NTN) sites are examined for trends using a general linear least
   squares model. SO42- concentrations are decreasing throughout the United
   States; significant (p < 0.05) trends are evident at 42 of the 58 sites
   included in this analysis and the average decrease is 12.026 mu eq
   l(-1). The largest concentration of sites with significant decreasing
   SO42- trends is located in the north central and western regions of the
   country. Eleven sites exhibit significant NO3- trends, nine of which are
   decreasing. Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations show the most widespread
   decline (44 and 52 sites, respectively) of all the major cations and
   anions in precipitation. Ca2+ concentrations have decreased 4.587 mu eq
   l(-1) since 1980; Mg2+ concentrations have decreased 2.034 mu eq l(-1).
   The most consistent and statistically most signigicant (p < 0.001) Ca2+
   and Mg2+ trends occur in the northeast. Decreasing trends are also
   evident at 28 sites for Na+ and at 35 sites for K+. NH4+ concentrations
   exhibit very little change over this 13-year period. The widespread
   decline in base cations, particularly Ca2+ and Mg2+, appears to have
   offset the effects that decreasing SO42- concentrations should have on
   free acidity in precipitation. Only 17 sites exhibit both significant
   decreasing H+ and SO42- concentration trends, most of which are located
   in the north central portion of the United States. The average decrease
   in H+ at the 17 sites is 9.991 mu eq l(-1). Hawaii is the only site in
   the NADP/NTN network to exhibit a significant increasing H+ trend.},

Abstract = {The Central Himalayan region is vulnerable to the adverse effects of
   climate change and characterized by regional climatic conditions. The
   livelihood of the mountain communities across the Himalaya is at risk
   owing to the consequences of variable precipitation patterns. There
   exists limited empirical research on precipitation variability due to
   inadequate hydro-meteorological stations at highaltitude regions. The
   study uses a novel methodology which integrates precipitation
   variability with resource sensitivity over the three verticals of
   Central Himalaya: Himadri, Himachal and Shivaliks and across four major
   river basins: Yamuna, Upper Ganga, Ghaghar and Ramganga. The magnitude
   of the significant precipitation trends was estimated through time
   series analysis at a 95\% confidence interval. To assess the sensitivity
   of natural resources (forest, water and land) and human resources,
   fourteen mountain-specific indicators were identified which captured
   resource index using data standardization and principal component
   analysis. Sen's slope and Resource index were plotted in a 2D Cartesian
   coordinate to draw precipitation-resource quadrants with their effective
   coverage area: High Precipitation and Scarce Resources (35.92\%); Low
   Precipitation and Abundant Resources (30.10\%); Low Precipitation and
   Scarce Resources (22.33\%) and High Precipitation and Abundant Resources
   (11.65\%). This helped in developing quadrant-specific adaptation
   strategies under regional variability of precipitation. The methodology
   and the research findings will certainly assist water experts, resource
   managers and policy makers to strengthen adaptive capacity and improve
   the resilience of vulnerable communities across Himalaya.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {We analysed the long-term trend and interannual variability in summer
   (JJA) precipitation over eastern Siberia (90 degrees-140 degrees E, 50
   degrees-70 degrees N) for the period 1979-2007. An increasing trend in
   summer precipitation was observed over large areas (Yenisei and Lena
   river basins) of eastern Siberia. Summer mean 850-hPa geopotential
   height decreased from Siberia to the marginal seas north of Siberia,
   with the largest decreases occurring over the northern part of eastern
   Siberia, while increasing trends were found around Mongolia, inducing a
   significant increase in westerly moisture flux and its convergence over
   eastern Siberia. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of
   detrended summer precipitation revealed the leading modes of the
   interannual variability. The first leading mode (EOF1) represents
   interannual variation around the central Siberian Plateau and the middle
   reaches of the Lena river basin, related to the enhancement of a
   low-level cyclonic circulation centred on 65 degrees N, 100 degrees E
   around eastern Siberia. The circulation pattern of EOF1 closely matches
   the trend pattern over Siberia, indicating that a deeper
   quasi-stationary trough appears with increasing frequency in recent
   decades. The second leading mode (EOF2) shows a dipole pattern between
   the middle reaches of the Lena river basin and the western part of the
   Central Siberian Plateau. Wet summers in the Lena river basin are
   related to a stationary trough centred at around 60 degrees N, 130
   degrees E. These leading patterns are related to the change in position
   of the stationary trough and the ridge of the wave train structure along
   the Arctic polar jet across the northern Eurasian continent.},

Abstract = {Changing rainfall patterns have significant effect on water resources,
   agriculture output in many countries, especially the country like India
   where the economy depends on rain-fed agriculture. Rainfall over India
   has large spatial as well as temporal variability. To understand the
   variability in rainfall, spatial-temporal analyses of rainfall have been
   studied by using 107 (1901-2007) years of daily gridded India
   Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall datasets. Further, the
   validation of IMD precipitation data is carried out with different
   observational and different reanalysis datasets during the period from
   1989 to 2007. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project data shows
   similar features as that of IMD with high degree of comparison, whereas
   Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration
   Towards Evaluation data show similar features but with large
   differences, especially over northwest, west coast and western
   Himalayas. Spatially, large deviation is observed in the interior
   peninsula during the monsoon season with National Aeronautics Space
   Administration-Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and
   Applications (NASA-MERRA), pre-monsoon with Japanese 25 years Re
   Analysis (JRA-25), and post-monsoon with climate forecast system
   reanalysis (CFSR) reanalysis datasets. Among the reanalysis datasets,
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Re-Analysis
   (ERA-Interim) shows good comparison followed by CFSR, NASA-MERRA, and
   JRA-25. Further, for the first time, with high resolution and long-term
   IMD data, the spatial distribution of trends is estimated using robust
   regression analysis technique on the annual and seasonal rainfall data
   with respect to different regions of India. Significant positive and
   negative trends are noticed in the whole time series of data during the
   monsoon season. The northeast and west coast of the Indian region shows
   significant positive trends and negative trends over western Himalayas
   and north central Indian region.},

Abstract = {Inter-annual variability and trends of annual/seasonal precipitation
   totals in Ghana are analyzed considering different gridded observational
   (gauge- and/or satellite-based) and reanalysis products. A
   quality-controlled dataset formed by fourteen gauges from the Ghana
   Meteorological Agency (GMet) is used as reference for the period
   1961-2010. Firstly, a good agreement is found between GMet and all the
   observational products in terms of variability, with better results for
   the gauge-based products-correlations in the range of 0.7-1.0 and nearly
   null biases-than for the satellite-gauge merged and satellite-derived
   products. In contrast, reanalyses exhibit a very poor performance, with
   correlations below 0.4 and large biases in most of the cases. Secondly,
   a Mann-Kendall trend analysis is carried out. In most cases, GMet data
   reveal the existence of predominant decreasing (increasing) trends for
   the first (second) half of the period of study, 1961-1985 (1986-2010).
   Again, observational products are shown to reproduce well the observed
   trends-with worst results for purely satellite-derived data-whereas
   reanalyses lead in general to unrealistic stronger than observed trends,
   with contradictory results (opposite signs for different reanalyses) in
   some cases. Similar inconsistencies are also found when analyzing trends
   of extreme precipitation indicators. Therefore, this study provides a
   warning concerning the use of reanalysis data as pseudo-observations in
   Ghana.},

Abstract = {An analysis of 67 sites of daily precipitation records over the
   1951-1996 period for Italy is presented. Seasonal and yearly total
   precipitation (TP), number of wet days (WDs) and precipitation intensity
   (PI) are investigated, and the trends both for the single station
   records, and for some different area average series are studied. PI is
   analysed by attributing precipitation to ten class-intervals, removing
   the influence of variations in the number of WDs to yield changes in the
   underlying shape of the WD amount distribution. The results show that
   the trend for the number of WDs in the year is significantly negative
   throughout Italy, stronger in the north than in the south: this trend is
   mainly a result of the winter. Moreover, they show that there is a
   tendency toward an increase in PI. This increase is globally less strong
   and significant than the decrease in the number of WDs. It is not
   concentrated in one specific season, but changes from area to area, and
   is generally weak in winter, due to a significant decrease of winter TP.
   In northern Italy, the increase in PI is mainly owing to a strong
   increase in the heaviest events, while in central-southern Italy, it
   depends on a larger part of the distribution of WD amounts. The analysis
   of the evolution of the class-interval contributions shows that the
   positive trend of the heaviest events starts in the 1970s, as does the
   negative trend of lightest events. Copyright (C) 2001 Royal

Abstract = {Ethiopia is vulnerable to climate change and Drought, which affect its
   water resources, agriculture, and food security. This study aims to
   study the future variability of annual precipitation in Ethiopia under
   different climate scenarios. We compared the observed annual Climate
   Hazard Group Infrared Precipitation with Station Data Version two
   (CHIRPSv2) precipitation with 14 CMIP6 model outputs from 1981 to 2014.
   The comparison based on statistical tools revealed that the six
   best-fitted models, namely BCC-CSM2-MR, CMCC-CM2-SR5, ISPL-CS6A-LR,
   CESM2, CESM2-WACCM, and GFDL-ESM4, were selected. The ensemble mean of
   the selected models was used to project the annual precipitation under
   two socio-economic pathways: SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, during the three
   periods: present (2015-2035), near future (2045-2065), and far future
   (2075-2100). The projected annual precipitation is expected to show an
   increasing trend in Ethiopia under both scenarios, with higher rates of
   change in southwestern and central Ethiopia. The temporal trend of
   annual precipitation is also expected to be 0.38 mm/year (near future)
   and 0.48 mm/year (far future) under SSP2-4.5, and 0.23 mm/year (near
   future) and 0.42 mm/year (far future) under SSP5-8.5. The projected
   increase in precipitation may have positive effects on water
   availability, crop production, and hydroelectric power generation in
   Ethiopia. Moreover, precipitation's spatial and temporal variability may
   pose challenges for water management, flood control, and adaptation
   planning.},

Title = {Contribution of the Precipitation-Recycling Process to the Wetting Trend
   in Xinjiang, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {Xinjiang, China has experienced a significant wetting trend since the
   mid-1980s in the context of climate warming. However, the features and
   mechanism associated with the water cycles in this region remain
   unclear. In this study, the contributions of the precipitation-recycling
   process to the wet-season (May-August) wetting trend are investigated
   using a dynamic recycling model and the Modern Era Retrospective
   analysis for Research and Application version 2 reanalysis product from
   1982 to 2020. The results show that the mean precipitation recycling
   ratio is 37.91\%, implying that Xinjiang precipitation is mainly
   contributed by external moisture. Moreover, the recycling ratio exhibits
   a significantly increasing trend of 2.29\% per decade, and this
   increased recycled precipitation contributes 55.55\% to the wet-season
   wetting trend in Xinjiang. The amount of externally advected moisture
   transported to Xinjiang has also increased in recent decades, accounting
   for 44.45\% of the wetting trend. Further analysis reveals that a
   deepening anomalous trough over Central Asia accompanied by
   strengthening moisture inflow through the southwest and south boundaries
   induce the increased inflow of moisture to Xinjiang, thereby increasing
   external-cycle precipitation in Xinjiang. Along with the strengthened
   ascending movement in the lower troposphere, the increasing atmospheric
   moisture content induced by enhanced evapotranspiration is beneficial
   for recycling precipitation in Xinjiang. These results imply that both
   the internal and external water cycles deserve further attention when
   exploring the wetting phenomenon in Xinjiang.},

Abstract = {The civil war, harsh climate, tough topography, and lack of accurate
   meteorological stations have limited observed data across Afghanistan.
   To fulfill the gap, this study analyzed the trend in precipitation and
   its extremes using Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational
   Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) daily dataset between
   1951 and 2010 at the spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees.
   Non-parametric modified Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were
   employed to detect the trend and quantify it at the significance level
   of 5\%. Significant decreasing trends were observed only in small
   clusters of southwestern regions ranging between 0 and -1.5mm/year and
   the northeastern region between -1.5 and -6 mm/year for the annual time
   series. A similar trend pattern was observed in the spring season
   decreasing at the rate of -0.15 and 0.54 mm/year in the northeastern and
   0 to -0.15 mm/year southwestern region. A decrease in spring
   precipitation is expected to affect crop production especially in the
   northeastern region which hosts 22\% of the arable area. An increasing
   trend in the eastern region at a maximum rate of 0.16 mm/year was
   observed which could intensify the flooding events. Trend analysis of
   extreme precipitation indices indicated similar spatial distribution to
   the mean precipitation, concentrated around southwestern, northeastern,
   and eastern regions. The increasing frequency of consecutive dry days in
   the western region and very heavy precipitation (R10mm) and extremely
   heavy precipitation (R20mm) in the eastern region could be fueling the
   occurrence of droughts and floods respectively. Taking these findings of
   the erratic nature of rainfall and extreme events into consideration for
   sustainable management of water resources would be fruitful.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a combination of a novel interpolation method and a local
   regression method was employed to improve the estimation accuracy of
   monthly precipitation over China. After the normalized processing and
   Box-Cox transformation of the data, we used the geographically weighted
   regression (GWR) method to describe the spatial precipitation trend, and
   then interpolated the residual by using a modified high accuracy surface
   modeling method (HASM-PRE). A high quality database of monthly
   precipitation with a resolution of 1 km(2) was constructed based on the
   meteorological stations. Results showed that wet years and dry years
   appear alternatively, and trend analysis of precipitation data series
   from 1981 to 2010 showed that the probability of years with extreme
   precipitation has increased in recent years. Precipitation in winter is
   rather uncertain and more dynamic from year to year compared to
   precipitation in summer.},

Abstract = {With increasing uncertainties associated with climate change,
   precipitation characteristics pattern are receiving much attention these
   days. This paper investigated the impact of climate change oil
   precipitation in the Kansabati basin, India. Trend and persistence of
   projected precipitation based oil annual, wet and dry periods were
   Studied using global climate model (GCM) and scenario uncertainty. A
   downscaling method based oil Bayesian neural network was applied to
   project precipitation generated from six GCMs using two scenarios (A2
   and B2). The precipitation values for any of three time periods (dry,
   wet and annual) do not show significant increasing or decreasing trends
   during 2001-2050 time period. There is likely an increasing trend in
   precipitation for annual and wet periods during 2051-2100 based oil A2
   scenario and a decreasing trend in dry period precipitation based oil B2
   scenario. Persistence during dry period precipitation among stations
   varies drastically based oil historical data with the highest
   persistence towards north-west part of the basin. Copyright (C) 2009

Abstract = {In studies of global warming, increases in tropospheric temperature as
   well as increases in surface temperature have attracted attention.
   Simulations of trends in these two temperatures appear to differ from
   trends in observations by surface sites, radiosondes, and satellites.
   Moreover, observation errors such as uncertainties in measurement
   precision and calibration, environmental changes, and the reorganization
   of network sites hamper the ability to quantify these influences on
   temperature trends. This paper presents multidecadal (1965-2016) trends
   in lower-tropospheric temperature for south-central Japan derived from
   thickness temperature, a measurement based on pressure data from exactly
   known altitudes at the summit of Mount Fuji (3776 m) and surrounding
   meteorological sites. The resulting trend is compared with the trends in
   surface temperature and in the temperature at 700 hPa measured by
   radiosonde. Although surface temperature increased faster than
   tropospheric (thickness) temperature in the study area for the 1965-2016
   period, tropospheric temperature increased faster than surface
   temperature after 1985. Additionally, it is found that radiosonde data
   are not appropriate for determining the temperature trend at constant
   altitudes because atmospheric warming raises the altitude of the
   pressure levels.},

Abstract = {The Indonesian government has decided to move its capital city from
   Jakarta in Java to Nusan-tara Capital City (IKN) on Borneo island. This
   study investigates the trend and variability of rain-fall in the IKN and
   two buffer cities and its relation to hydrometeorological disasters. We
   analyze 20 years of Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM
   (IMERG) version 6 data and hydromete-orological disaster information
   from the National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure. The an-nual
   rainfall, the extreme rain index of R95p (number of very wet days), and
   R99p (number of very extremely wet days) show a slightly decreasing
   trend. However, the index of consecutive wet days (CWD) increases,
   resembling the rising number of floods and landslides. Rainfall shows
   robust seasonal and diurnal variations. Peak rainfall occurs in
   November-December and March-April, while the driest period is observed
   during August-October. Dry months associated with El-Nino, can cause
   severe dry conditions and increase the potential for catastrophic forest
   fires. The peak precipitation amount and frequency were observed in the
   early morning and the second peak in the afternoon. Mainland areas tend
   to have a peak occurring later than those on the coast and ocean. The
   results of this study can be additional information in formulating a
   strategic plan to anticipate future hydrometeorological disasters in

   briefly explained along with the T-170 model. The two important weather
   parameters considered in detail are rainfall and temperature. Both the
   parameters have biases. Techniques used for obtaining bias-free rainfall
   forecasts and temperature trend-based forecasts are explained in detail.
   These forecasts are obtained for all of the 602 districts of India.
   Finally, an evaluation of the accuracy of rainfall and temperature
   forecasts for selected districts for which the observed data could be
   obtained during the 2006 monsoon is presented. Copyright (c) 2007 Royal

Title = {Precipitation Anomalies and Trends Estimated via Satellite Rainfall

   Brazil},
Journal = {CLIMATE},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to select the best orbital sensor for
   rainfall estimates (monthly and annual scales) and to analyze the
   frequency and magnitude of extreme rainfall events and their trends and
   disruptions based on the use of satellite rainfall product data for the
   Cananeia-Iguape Coastal System (CICS). Data from four satellite rainfall
   products were used to identify the correspondence with seven points on
   the surface of the study area. Statistical metrics were used to identify
   the best satellite rainfall product. After identifying the sensor with
   the best performance in estimating orbital precipitation, extreme events
   were identified by the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) on a
   one-month (SPI-1), three-month (SPI-3), and twelve-month (SPI-12) scale.
   Trend and rupture detection in the time series were performed using
   different statistical techniques (Mann-Kendall, Pettitt, Standard Normal
   Homogeneity Test, or Buishand test). Among the satellite rainfall
   products, CHIRPS had the best measurements for the analyzed points on
   the surface. The year 1983 was characterized as very rainy, also marked
   by the occurrence of El Nino, and was marked by the rupture of the rains
   at all points (IDs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) analyzed in the month of
   June. The decrease in monthly rainfall was more significant in the
   months of February (at points IDs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7) and April (IDs 1,
   3, 5, and 7). Decreased rainfall may cause CICS mangrove shrinkage.
   These results showed the importance of studying rainfall in an area with
   mangroves in order to understand the dynamics of vegetation in the face
   of climate change.},

Abstract = {This study focused on the trends of rainfall variability and drought
   monitoring in the northern region of Pakistan (Gilgit-Baltistan).
   Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)
   model data were used for the period of 1981 to 2020. The Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) was applied to assess the dry and wet
   conditions during the study period. The Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's
   rho (SR) trend tests were applied to calculate the trend of drought. A
   coupled model intercomparison project-global circulation model
   (CMIP5-GCMs) was used to project the future precipitation in
   Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) for the 21st century using a multimodel ensemble
   (MME) technique for representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and
   RCP 8.5. From the results, the extreme drought situations were observed
   in the 12-month SPI series in 1982 in the Diamir, Ghizer, and Gilgit
   districts, while severe drought in 1982-1983 was observed in Astore,
   Ghizer, Gilgit, Hunza-Nagar, and Skardu. Similarly, in 2000-2001 severe
   drought prevailed in Diamir, Ghanche, and Skardu. The results of MK and
   SR indicate a significant increasing trend of rainfall in the study
   area, which is showing the conversion of snowfall to rainfall due to
   climate warming. The future precipitation projections depicted an
   increase of 4\% for the 21st century as compared with the baseline
   period in the GB region. The results of the midcentury projections
   depicted an increase in precipitation of about 13\%, while future
   projections for the latter half of the century recorded a decrease in
   precipitation (about 9\%) for both RCPs, which can cause flooding in
   midcentury and drought in the latter half of the century. The study area
   is the host of the major glaciers in Pakistan from where the Indus River
   receives its major tributaries. The area and volume of these glaciers
   are decreasing due to warming impacts of climate change. Therefore, this
   study is useful for proper water resource management to cope up with
   water scarcity in the future.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Trends and Variations of the Rainfall Amount, Intensity,
   and Frequency in TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {The spatiotemporal mean rain rate (MR) can be characterized by the rain
   frequency (RF) and the conditional rain rate (CR). We computed these
   parameters for each season using the TMPA 3-hourly, 0.25 \& DEG; gridded
   data for the 1998-2017 period at a quasi-global scale, 50 \& DEG;N\~{}50
   \& DEG;S. For the global long-term average, MR, RF, and CR are 2.83
   mm/d, 10.55\%, and 25.05 mm/d, respectively. The seasonal time series of
   global mean RF and CR show significant decreasing and increasing trends,
   respectively, while MR depicts only a small but significant trend. The
   seasonal anomaly of RF decreased by 5.29\% and CR increased 13.07 mm/d
   over the study period, while MR only slightly decreased by -0.029
   mm/day. The spatiotemporal patterns in MR, RF, and CR suggest that
   although there is no prominent trend in the total precipitation amount,
   the frequency of rainfall events becomes smaller and the average
   intensity of a single event becomes stronger. Based on the
   co-variability of RF and CR, the paper optimally classifies the
   precipitation over land and ocean into four categories using K-means
   clustering. The terrestrial clusters are consistent with the dry and wet
   climatology, while categories over the ocean indicate high RF and medium
   CR in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) region; low RF with low
   CR in oceanic dry zones; and low RF and high CR in storm track areas.
   Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was then performed, and
   these results indicated that the major pattern of MR is characterized by
   an El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal while RF and CR variations
   are dominated by their trends.},

Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {{[}1] We have analyzed the relationship between surface air temperature
   ( SAT), ground surface temperature (GST), and snow cover (SNC) over the
   terrestrial Northern Hemisphere based on general circulation model (GCM)
   simulations using GISS modelE forced with the observed SST and radiative
   forcing changes from 1951 - 1998. While SAT is the dominant influence on
   GST during the warm-season, it explains only half of the variance in GST
   during the cold-season, with SNC and pre-conditioning by prior
   warm-season SAT also exhibiting a sizeable and, in places, dominant
   influence. During a period of coincident surface warming and cold-season
   snowcover decrease in the model ( 1971 - 1998), mean GST increases are
   0.2 degreesC less than those in SAT, a consequence of greater exposure
   of the ground surface to winter cold air outbreaks. Interpretations of
   past SAT trends from borehole-based GST reconstructions may therefore be
   substantially biased by seasonal influences and snow cover changes.},

Abstract = {Trends in maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min) and mean (T-mean)
   temperatures; diurnal temperature range (DTR = T-max - T-min); and
   sunshine duration at eight sites in Northeast (NE) India were
   investigated. Three sites observed decreasing trends in DTR
   corresponding to annual, seasonal (pre-monsoon and monsoon) and monthly
   (September) time scales. On the other hand, DTR increases were also
   observed at other three sites in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons as
   well as in the months of June, October and December. The sites showing
   DTR decreases (increases) witnessed either increasing trends in T-min
   (T-max) or decreasing trends in T-max (T-min), with T-max (T-min)
   showing either no trend or increasing at a smaller rate than T-min
   (T-max). Temperature remained practically trendless in winter and
   pre-monsoon seasons over NE India. However, temperature increases were
   observed in monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Decreasing trends in
   sunshine duration were observed mainly on annual, seasonal (winter and
   pre-monsoon) and monthly (January, February and March) time scales.
   Concomitant decreases in sunshine duration may be one of the potential
   causes of the observed DTR decreases over NE India. Copyright (C) 2010

Abstract = {This study aimed to provide broad insight into the long-term trends and
   periodicity of monthly and seasonal precipitation in Turkey and to
   evaluate their implications for sectoral water availability. Overall,
   Turkey's monthly precipitation declined over the last five decades.
   While decreasing precipitation trends were dominant in the wet season,
   consistently increasing trends prevailed in the dry season. The monthly
   monotonic trends were marked by larger downward trends, especially in
   early winter and spring. The trend magnitudes in annual and wet season
   precipitation decreased from north to south and west to east, reaching a
   maximum value of 7.5 mm/year increase in the eastern Black Sea. The
   magnitude of dry season trends was much smaller but consistent across
   the country, varying by 1-5 mm/year. Monthly changes in the trend
   magnitudes varied between - 2.2 and 3.4 mm, reflecting both decrease and
   increase, respectively. The magnitude of the downward precipitation
   trends was higher in inland regions than in other regions. Spatial
   patterns in the trends evidenced that wet season precipitation
   variability largely governs annual precipitation variability. The
   wavelet spectrum indicated a strong annual signal for the monthly
   precipitation. The inland regions experienced the periodicity of wet
   years at much longer durations. An average 8-year periodicity was
   dominant for the annual precipitation, underlining its inter-annual
   variability and coincided well with the NAO spectrum. Assuming the
   identified trends persist in the future, a further increase in the
   magnitude of precipitation trends in coastal areas can enhance the flood
   risk. However, the precipitation decreases during the wet season are
   bound to have adverse consequences on sectoral-dependent water
   availability.},

Title = {Forcing and response in simulated 20th and 21st century surface energy

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {114},

Abstract = {A simple methodology is applied to a transient integration of the Met
   Office Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version1 (UKMO-HadGEM1)
   fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model in order to
   separate forcing from climate response in simulated 20th century and
   future global mean surface energy and precipitation trends. Forcings
   include any fast responses that are caused by the forcing agent and that
   are independent of global temperature change. Results reveal that
   surface radiative forcing is dominated by shortwave forcing over the
   20th and 21st centuries, which is strongly negative. However, when fast
   responses of surface turbulent heat fluxes are separated from climate
   feedbacks, and included in the forcing, net surface forcing becomes
   positive. The nonradiative forcings are the result of rapid surface and
   tropospheric adjustments and impact 20th century, as well as future,
   evaporation and precipitation trends. A comparison of energy balance
   changes in eight different climate models finds that all models exhibit
   a positive surface energy imbalance by the late 20th century. However,
   there is considerable disagreement in how this imbalance is partitioned
   between the longwave, shortwave, latent heat and sensible heat fluxes.
   In particular, all models show reductions in shortwave radiation
   absorbed at the surface by the late 20th century compared to the
   pre-industrial control state, but the spread of this reduction leads to
   differences in the sign of their latent heat flux changes and thus in
   the sign of their hydrological responses.},

Abstract = {Samples of precipitation: rain, sleet and snow, were collected at the
   centre of the city of Poznan and in the Wielkopolski National Park.
   Samples were collected from 26 Nov. 1996 to 20 Nov. 1999. PAHs were
   isolated by extraction in the system liquid-solid state (columns for SPE
   and a Speedisk-adsorbent C-18). Determination was performed on a liquid
   chromatograph HPLC. The breakdown curves for naphthalene (SPE, Empore
   and Speedisk) were given. The main PAHs occurring in the samples from
   the city and from the National Park area were naphthalene and
   anthracene. The other PAH compounds occurred at much lower
   concentrations. The content of benzo{[}a]pyrene did not exceed the
   permissible level. Significant differences were noted in the content of
   certain PAHs depending on the kind of precipitation. Differences in PAHs
   concentrations were also observed between the precipitation samples
   collected in winter and spring.
   The results of PAH determinations over the few years of observation,
   from 1996 to 1999, prove a decrease in the contents of the majority of
   PAHs in precipitation, which is directly related to intense
   modernisation of the system of central heating and the changeover from
   coal to gas heating.},

Title = {Asymmetric seasonal temperature trends},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Current consensus on global climate change predicts warming trends
   driven by anthropogenic forcing, with maximum temperature changes
   projected in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) high latitudes during winter.
   Yet, global temperature trends show little warming over the most recent
   decade or so. For longer time periods appropriate to the assessment of
   trends, however, global temperatures have experienced significant
   warming trends for all seasons except winter, when cooling trends exist
   instead across large stretches of eastern North America and northern
   Eurasia. Hence, the most recent lapse in global warming is a seasonal
   phenomenon, prevalent only in boreal winter. Additionally, we show that
   the largest regional contributor to global temperature trends over the
   past two decades is land surface temperatures in the NH extratropics.
   Therefore, proposed mechanisms explaining the fluctuations in global
   annual temperatures should address this apparent seasonal asymmetry.

Abstract = {Annual and seasonal trends were discussed for precipitation chemistry in
   Japan on the basis of a nationwide monitoring network by Japan
   Environment Agency. For this analysis, 17 sites, selected from the 23
   network sites after evaluation of data completeness for the present
   purpose, were grouped into four areas in terms of the sea which could
   characterize each area: the Pacific Ocean, the Japan Sea, the Seto
   Inland Sea and the East China Sea areas. Major ion concentrations at
   each site were subjected to least-squares multiple regression analysis,
   and discussion was principally focused on the area-groups. Each area
   showed significant (p<0.05) decreasing trends in non-sea-salt sulfate
   (nss-SO42-) concentrations with the annual mean change rate of -3.0\%
   yr(-1), whereas no significant trends were detected for NO3- at 59\% of
   the sites. Ammonium (NH4+) showed significant increasing trends for
   35\%, and decreasing trends for 18\% of the sites; and, the maximum
   change rate of 3.8\% yr(-1) was recorded in the Pacific Ocean area.
   Non-sea-salt calcium (nss-Ca2+) concentrations significantly decreased
   in northern and some industrialized areas. Both the annual
   cycle-amplitudes and effects of precipitation amounts were significant
   for the four ions at almost all sites. The maximum concentrations of
   nss-SO42- and -Ca2+ occurred from winter to spring at most sites. The
   seasons when the maximum concentrations of NO3- and NH4+ occurred, were
   found to differ from area to area. Furthermore, the trends in
   precipitation nss-SO42-, and NO3- were qualitatively consistent with
   those of anthropogenic emissions Of S02, and NO, in Japan, respectively.

Abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of oxygen (O-18/O-16) and hydrogen (D/H) in water
   have long been considered powerful indicators of paleoclimate. However,
   quantitative interpretation of isotope variations in terms of climate
   changes is hampered by a limited understanding of physical processes
   controlling the global isotope behavior. Analysis was conducted of time
   series of O-18 content (deltaO-18) of monthly precipitation and surface
   air temperature available through the International Atomic Energy
   Agency-World Meteorological Organization global network, ``Isotopes in
   Precipitation.{''} This study indicates that long-term changes of
   isotopic composition of precipitation over mid- and high-latitude
   regions during the past three decades closely followed long-term changes
   of surface air temperature with the average deltaO-18-temperature
   coefficient around 0.6 per mil per degree Celsius.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change on many disciplines has been examined by
   researchers in recent decades. One of the indicators of climate change
   is increasing extreme precipitation. The annual, seasonal, and monthly
   precipitation trends at the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed
   (NAEW) were studied to identify statistically significant changes in
   precipitation trends and to compare the consistency of local
   precipitation trends with reported trends on a regional scale. Daily
   average precipitation was calculated using data collected from 1939 to
   2011 at 11 rain gauges located at the NAEW near Coshocton, Ohio. Rank
   correlation was used to test for trends for three time periods.(annual,
   seasonal, and monthly), for three response variables (total amount of
   precipitation, number of wet days, and the maximum daily precipitation),
   and for three data sets (the complete set of data and the upper 10th and
   5th percentile data sets). Total precipitation showed a significant
   increasing trend for the fall season and for the months of October and
   November. Number of wet days showed significantly increasing trends for
   the months of August, October, and December. Maximum daily precipitation
   showed significantly increasing trends for the fall season as well as
   for three individual months of fall (September, October, and November).
   Considering the upper 10th, the annual averaged precipitation as well as
   seasonally averaged precipitation of fall and summer showed
   significantly increasing trends. Considering the upper 5th, the
   seasonally averaged precipitation of fall and winter showed
   significantly increasing trends. Annual and extreme trends on the local
   scale for the time period of 1958 to 2011 showed consistency with the
   reported trends by Karl et al. (2009) for regional scales for the time
   period of 1958 to 2007. The first and second response variables showed
   significant annual increasing trends for the complete set of data as
   well as for the upper 10th and 5th percentiles from 1958 to 2011. A
   piecewise linear least-squares estimation showed that starting in 1963
   annual precipitation changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing
   trend. However, the decreasing trend was not significant, and only the
   post-1963 data showed a significant,increasing trend. The results were
   similar in Karl's regional approach. Based on the results, one to three
   months of the fall season (September, October, and November) have an
   increasing trend in the three precipitation response variables.},

Abstract = {Quantifying precipitation variability and trends is difficult and merits
   regular reassessment. In the present study, the seasonal homogenized
   precipitation series in Switzerland is investigated for the period
   1901-2013 in terms of trends, inter-annual variability and the influence
   of large-scale flow. An objective clustering is applied, resulting in 32
   distinct precipitation regions. Trends are analysed for all 32 regions
   with moving trend windows, and statistical significance (p < 0.05) is
   assessed with Theil-Sen trend estimates and nonparametric Mann-Kendall
   trend tests. Inter-annual precipitation varies considerably regionally
   and seasonally. Of 2720 analysed trend windows of 33-113 years in
   length, 194 (7.1\%) show a significantly positive trend and 10 (0.4\%) a
   significantly negative trend. Most of the significantly positive trends
   are found for 50+ year series for winter, autumn and the year. 81\% of
   the annual and 72\% of the winter series show positive trends (0-3\% per
   decade) for the 1901-2013 period. The trends are significant for 34\%
   (22\%) of the annual (winter) series. Long-term trends are generally in
   line with earlier estimates in literature considering somewhat shorter
   time periods. Significantly negative trends are only found for winter in
   the most recent decades. No significant trends are found for
   inter-annual variability and changes in the 10th and 90th percentile
   seasonal extreme precipitation thresholds. The influence of large-scale
   flow on precipitation variability is strongest in winter. The leading
   pattern for northern Switzerland (nS) is the Euro-Atlantic blocking
   pattern. For southern Switzerland (sS), the Eastern Atlantic
   (Scandinavian) pattern is dominant in winter (autumn). In nS, wet (dry)
   seasons are linked to south-westerly (north-easterly) flow. In sS, wet
   (dry) seasons are linked to southerly (northerly) flow. Strong evidence
   for imprints of atmospheric blocking on seasonal precipitation
   variability is found in winter and autumn. In spring, a high pressure
   anomaly stretching from the mid-Atlantic to central Europe is indicative
   of dryness in nS.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {63-70},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the southwestern United States, monsoon precipitation can affect
   changes to the land surface, vegetation communities and ecosystem
   services. To better understand monsoon precipitation, we quantified
   change in precipitation properties from 1910 to 2010 at 22 sites across
   the northern Chihuahuan Desert using United States Historical
   Climatology Network daily data. We also assessed precipitation
   variability at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) - located
   at the desert's ecological boundary using daily data from a recent
   10-year period. Evaluating precipitation at these locations allows for
   comparison of precipitation variability between ecologically-stable
   ecoregions and the less-stable boundaries where ecological change may be
   more likely to occur. Regional data from 1910 to 2010 show an increase
   in the number of precipitation events, a decrease in their magnitude,
   and also an increase in the length of extreme periods with and without
   precipitation. At the SNWR, total precipitation is influenced by a small
   number of large events, while the majority of events (65\%) have an
   insignificant effect. These analyses suggest that local variability in
   precipitation may be greater than is often attributed to the summer
   monsoon, and the difference between wet and dry monsoons depends on the
   occurrence of a small number of large events. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Statistical models consisting of a trend plus serially correlated noise
   may be fitted to observed climate data such as global surface
   temperature, the trend and noise representing systematic change and
   other variations, respectively. When such a model is fitted, the
   estimated character of the noise determines the precision of the
   estimated trend, and hence the precision of the estimate of the
   magnitude of the systematic change in the variable considered. The
   results of fitting such models to global temperature imply that there is
   uncertainty in the amount of temperature change over the past century of
   up to +/- 0.2-degrees-C, but that the change of around one half of a
   degree Celsius is significantly different from zero.
   The statistical models for climate variability also imply that the
   observed temperature data provide only imprecise information about the
   climate sensitivity. This is defined here as the equilibrium response of
   global temperature to a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of
   carbon dioxide. The temperature changes observed to date are compatible
   with a wide range of climate sensitivities, from 0.7-degrees-C to
   2.2-degrees-C. When data uncertainties are taken into account, the
   interval widens even further.},

Abstract = {In the era of changing climate, drought assessment and monitoring are
   vital at the Langat River Basin, a fast-growing region in Peninsular
   Malaysia with two dams located in the basin. Drought indices
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) that is solely based on rainfall,
   and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) that
   considers both rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET), were
   adopted to assess the frequency and severity of droughts in this study.
   The General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs from the second generation
   Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) under the Representative
   Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 were statistically downscaled using the
   Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) version 4.2.9 to produce the
   required regionalized rainfall and temperature data. Both indices with
   respective time scales of 1-, 3- and 6-month were calculated using
   observed and the projected climate data. Downscaling results showed that
   temperature of the basin will increase drastically in 2021-2050.
   Therefore, PET should not be excluded in drought assessments. It was
   found that SPI tends to underestimate drought events, and its
   correlation with SPEI decreases over time. Hence, SPEI, that considers
   the effect of PET, is more suitable for describing drought events. In
   general, projected high rainfall reduces the frequency and severity of
   drought in the Langat River Basin.},

Abstract = {Pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries of the world to
   temperature extremes due to its predominant arid climate and geographic
   location in the fast temperature rising zone. Spatial distribution of
   the trends in annual and seasonal temperatures and temperature extremes
   over Pakistan has been assessed in this study. The gauge-based gridded
   daily temperature data of Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST)
   having a spatial resolution of 1 degrees x1 degrees was used for the
   assessment of trends over the period 1960-2013 using modified
   Mann-Kendall test (MMK), which can discriminate the multi-decadal
   oscillatory variations from secular trends. The results show an increase
   in the annual average of daily maximum and minimum temperatures in 92
   and 99\% area of Pakistan respectively at 95\% level of confidence. The
   annual temperature is increasing faster in southern high-temperature
   region compared to other parts of the country. The minimum temperature
   is rising faster (0.17-0.37 degrees C/decade) compared to maximum
   temperature (0.17-0.29 degrees C/decade) and therefore declination of
   diurnal temperature range (DTR) (-0.15 to -0.08 degrees C/decade) in
   some regions. The annual numbers of both hot and cold days are
   increasing in whole Pakistan except in the northern sub-Himalayan
   region. Heat waves are on the rise, especially in the hot Sindh plains
   and the Southern coastal region, while the cold waves are becoming
   lesser in the northern cold region. Obtained results contradict with the
   findings of previous studies on temperature trends, which indicate the
   need for reassessment of climatic trends in Pakistan using the MMK test
   to understand the anthropogenic impacts of climate change.},

Abstract = {The Mann-Kendall test was applied on homogeneous Jordanian and Israeli
   precipitation series to test for trends. Overall, 37 precipitation
   series with continuous data for the time period 1961-1990 were
   identified as homogeneous. During this time period a non-significant
   negative precipitation trend could be observed on annual sum. The same
   analysis was thereafter applied at the same stations, but with longer
   time series. The data availability differed from station to station, but
   the mean time period with available data was 1950-1997. The new result
   showed a stronger negative precipitation trend. This demonstrates how
   time series of different length can influence the result of trend
   analysis. As a step to identify a suitable drought index for the region,
   the correlation between precipitation and the Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) received from remote sensing was investigated. A
   correlation would indicate that a precipitation based drought index
   could be suitable to assess the impact of possible precipitation trends.
   A high correlation was generally observed on natural vegetated areas;
   the correlation on irrigated land was lower. This suggests that a
   drought index based on precipitation alone may be applicable to the
   region, but the performance on non-rainfed agricultural areas may
   increase with consideration to irrigation.},

Abstract = {Trends in rainfall-ajusted sulfate concentration were assessed for 5-yr

   stations in New York by using the seasonal Kendall test. For the 5-yr
   subrecord from 1978 to 1982, the trends for the bulk deposition were
   similar to those for weekly wet-only deposition for adjacent stations of
   the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP). The long-term trend
   at each of the bulk precipitation sites was downward and statistically
   significant at P < 0.02, whereas 26\% of the 69 subrecords had trends
   that were statistically significant only at p < 0.2. Of these
   statistically significant subrecord trends, 10\% were positive (opposite
   to the long-term trend). Furthermore, the slopes of the subrecord trends
   tended to be much steeper than those of the whole record. These 5-yr
   trends, consequently, are poor indicators of the trends that occur over
   much longer periods in the same record.},

Abstract = {We present a new analysis of global radiosonde temperature data. From
   1979 onwards, the data from the Australasian region have been corrected
   for instrument-related discontinuities with the help of comparisons with
   collocated retrievals from satellite-based Microwave Sounding Units
   (MSU) and metadata: in future work, adjustments will be applied
   worldwide and extended to earlier years. The data are stored as monthly
   anomalies from a 1971-1990 reference period on a 5 degrees latitude x 10
   degrees longitude grid at 8 levels from 50 hPa to 850 hPa. Seasonal and
   annual temperature anomalies have also been created on a 10 degrees x 20
   degrees grid using an eigenvector reconstruction method to filter noise.
   Latitude-height profiles of zonal-mean temperature changes since the
   1960s show significant cooling in the lower stratosphere, especially in
   middle and high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, but the cooling
   over Australasia is less than shown by unadjusted data. Warming
   dominates the troposphere but is not a maximum in the tropical upper
   troposphere. In the annual mean, tropospheric warming is greatest around
   45 degrees N and possibly in the data-sparse high latitudes of the
   Southern Hemisphere.},

Abstract = {In Poland the phase in which precipitation occurs impacts the
   availability of water in its reservoirs, the potential for hydrological
   droughts, snowfall flooding and winter recreation. The influence of
   warming on the occurrence of precipitation phases on the Polish scale
   has not been studied so far. Based on data from 42 synoptic stations for
   the period 1966-2020, this study discusses trends in the indices of
   liquid (Lq), mixed (Mx) and solid (Sd) precipitation describing their
   totals (T), frequencies (Nd) and contribution to overall precipitation
   totals (T\%) and a number of days with overall precipitation (Nd\%) from
   a seasonal perspective. Moreover, the influence of seasonal and daily
   air temperatures on long-term variability in the precipitation phase
   indices was assessed. The precipitation phase was discriminated based on
   the observations of weather phenomena noted as current and past weather
   considering days with precipitation > 0.1 mm. Precipitation phases
   significantly reacted to current warming. The strongest and widespread
   were increasing trends in rains (+1.74 for LqNd, +5.35 mm for LqT,
   +3.51\% for LqNd\%, +4.08\% for LqT\% per decade) and decreasing trends
   in snowfalls (-1.92 for SdNd, -3.12 mm for SdT, -3.65\% for SdNd\%,
   -3.26\% for SdT\% per decade) in winter when the warming was weakest but
   average temperature was close to freezing point. In winter, air
   temperature explained 60\%-80\% of the variance in the frequency of
   snowfall and rainfall. Daily air temperature > -2 degrees C contributed
   to trends in winter rainfall while daily air temperature > 1 degrees C
   most contributed to trends in winter snowfall. No trends in winter mixed
   precipitation were due to opposite changes in its frequency above and
   below 1 degrees C. In spring, the increase in a liquid phase was due
   more to the melting of a solid and mixed phase, while in autumn, it was
   due more to the transformation of a mixed phase into a liquid phase. In
   spring, air temperature explained at most 30\%-50\% of the variance in
   the indices of snowfall frequency. Negative trends in mixed
   precipitation were significant in transitional seasons, being more
   prominent in spring than in autumn and were mostly driven by changes in
   daily air temperatures between 0 and 5 degrees C. A diminished
   percentage of summer rains on days with air temperatures below 15
   degrees C was compensated by their increase above that threshold thus
   producing no long-term trends. Warming significantly weakened the
   relationships between precipitation phases and average seasonal air
   temperatures except for summer rainfalls.},

Abstract = {Using non-parametric techniques, we studied water chemistry changes from
   1983 to 1992 in 18 rivers located at the extreme northeastern portion of
   North America. This period was marked by a decrease in sulfate (SO4-2)
   production in eastern Canada from 1982 to 1986, followed by a levelling
   off from 1986 to 1992. Nitrate (NO3-) production and deposition
   generally increased over this whole period. We used two time windows,
   1983 to 1989 and 1983 to 1992, to determine if changes in river
   acidification variables occurred over the ten year period. We found
   significant trends of increasing pH and acid neutralization capacity
   (ANC) concentrations at eight sites using both time windows, while SO4-2
   increased at five and seven sites during the same two time periods.
   Nitrate concentrations showed few consistent trends, while base cations
   showed increases in the earlier part of the data set and total organic
   carbon (TOC) showed long-term decreases. There were few significant
   trends in hydrogen (H+), and a slight decrease in SO4-2 exports as
   opposed to increased concentrations over the same period. We attribute
   the discrepancy between SO4-2 concentration and export trends to be due
   to evapotranspiration in the basins, causing a concentration of ions in
   water. Nitrate and calcium exports showed no trends, while TOC decreased
   at four or five sites, depending on the time window used. Longer data
   sets tended to produce more detectable trends. Overall, water chemistry
   in the region is showing the effects of reduced SO4- loads and is not
   yet being affected by the increases in NO3- deposition.},

   significant upward trend, and the annual runoff showed no significant
   downward trend. The results of cumulative anomaly test, MK mutation test
   and sliding t test are consistent, there were three mutation years of
   1984, 1997 and 2005 in the time series of annual precipitation and
   runoff in the Jinsha River basin. This study also provides necessary
   hydrometeorological basic information for quantitative assessment of the
   contribution rate of climate change and human activities to runoff

Abstract = {This study focuses on the analysis of the nonstationarlty
   characteristics of extreme precipitation and their attributions in the
   southeastern coastal region of China. The maximum daily precipitation
   (MDP) series is extracted from observations at 79 meteorological
   stations in the study area during the first flood season (April-June)
   from 1960 to 2012. The trends of the mean (Mn) and variance (Var) of MDP
   are detected using the Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale,
   and Shape parameters (GAMLSS) and Mann-Kendall test. The contributions
   of natural climate change and human activities to the Mn and Var changes
   of MDP are investigated using six large-scale circulation variables and
   emissions of four greenhouse gases based on GAMLSS and a contribution
   analysis method. The results demonstrate that the nonstadonarity of
   extreme precipitation on local scales is significant. The Mn and Var of
   extreme precipitation increase in the north of Zhejiang, the middle of
   Fujian, and the south of Guangdong. In general, natural climate change
   contributes more to Mn from 1960 to 2012 than to Var. However, human
   activities cause a greater Var in the rapid socioeconomic development
   period (1986-2012) than in the slow socioeconomic development period
   (1960-1985), especially in Zhejiang and Guangdong. The community should
   pay more attention to the possibility of extreme precipitation events
   and associated disasters triggered by human activities.},

Title = {Trend in frequency of extreme precipitation events over Ontario from

Abstract = {As one of the most important extreme weather event types, extreme
   precipitation events have significant impacts on human and natural
   environment. This study assesses the projected long term trends in
   frequency of occurrence of extreme precipitation events represented by
   heavy precipitation days, very heavy precipitation days, very wet days
   and extreme wet days over Ontario, based on results of 21 CMIP3 GCM
   runs. To achieve this goal, first, all model data are linearly
   interpolated onto 682 grid points (0.45A degrees A xA 0.45A degrees) in
   Ontario; Next, biases in model daily precipitation amount are corrected
   with a local intensity scaling method to make the total wet days and
   total wet day precipitation from each of the GCMs are consistent with
   that from the climate forecast system reanalysis data, and then the four
   indices are estimated for each of the 21 GCM runs for 1968-2000,
   2046-2065 and 2081-2100. After that, with the assumption that the rate
   parameter of the Poisson process for the occurrence of extreme
   precipitation events may vary with time as climate changes, the Poisson
   regression model which expresses the log rate as a linear function of
   time is used to detect the trend in frequency of extreme events in the
   GCMs simulations; Finally, the trends and their uncertainty are
   estimated. The result shows that in the twenty-first century annual
   heavy precipitation days, very heavy precipitation days and very wet
   days and extreme wet days are likely to significantly increase over
   major parts of Ontario and particularly heavy precipitation days, very
   wet days are very likely to significantly increase in some sub-regions
   in eastern Ontario. However, trends of seasonal indices are not
   significant.},

Title = {Homogeneity of precipitation series in the Netherlands and their trends

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},

Abstract = {The historical daily precipitation observations for the Netherlands were
   fully digitized recently. The homogeneity of the precipitation series
   was tested by pairwise comparisons of the monthly totals using an
   algorithm of Menne and Williams. Forty percent of the precipitation
   series was indicated as inhomogeneous if the algorithm was applied to
   the untransformed monthly totals. The use of a square-root
   transformation to reduce the skewness was only successful in an
   application to the data for the 19512009 period. Changes in the annual
   precipitation amounts, the precipitation amounts in the winter and
   summer halves of the year, the number of days per year with a
   precipitation amount greater than 20 or 30 mm, and the 5-d annual
   maximum precipitation amount were determined both for the period
   19512009 using the data from 240 stations and the period 19102009 with
   the data from 102 stations. Significant increases were found for all six
   indices. The centennial increases in mean annual, winter and summer
   precipitation are 25, 35, and 16\%, respectively. The exceedance
   frequency of the 30 mm threshold almost doubled during the 19102009
   period. Much attention is given to the field significance of trends, the
   statistical significance of regional differences in trends and
   nonlinearity of trends. In contrast to the increase in mean winter
   precipitation, which is statistically significant for the majority of
   the stations, the increase in mean summer precipitation is mainly
   restricted to coastal regions. The mean summer precipitation and the
   exceedance frequencies of the 20 and 30 mm thresholds show a relatively
   strong increase from the beginning of the 1980s. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {The high variability of the Mediterranean climate from year to year and
   within each year makes it difficult to assess changes that could be
   associated with a climate change. In this paper some indices, such as
   changes in the precipitation concentration during the year, maximum
   1-day and 5-day precipitation, number of wet days (total and those with
   precipitation higher than the 75th and 95th percentile), magnitude and
   frequency of extreme events (considered as the rainfall higher than that
   corresponding to the 99th percentile), fraction of annual total
   precipitation due to events exceeding the 95th and 99th percentile,
   strength of the events, and length and frequency of dry period (days
   between consecutive rains) are evaluated for the Penedes-Anoia region
   (NE Spain). A 80-year daily dataset (1923-2002) and two 40-year series
   were used to assess possible trends. The indices indicate an increase in
   precipitation in winter and summer and a positive trend of concentration
   in autumn, with a higher number of extreme events separated by longer
   dry periods. The total number of wet days per year increased, although
   it was irregularly distributed over the year, with an increase in the
   extremes and in the fraction of total rainfall that these events
   represent in autumn and winter, and with an increase of the strength of
   the events in autumn. These changes in rainfall distribution have
   negative effects on water availability for crops and contribute to
   accelerate erosion processes in the area.},

Journal = {EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {Climate change has become an undeniable global challenge, emphasizing
   the need for a deeper understanding of historical and future climatic
   trends. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of extreme rainfall
   and hydrological events and their impact on Burundi from 1983 until
   2023. This research estimates the annual mean, seasonal, and monthly
   trends along with trends in extreme indices for precipitation and
   discharge. Statistical methods used include the linear regression
   analysis, the Modified Mann-Kendall test, and the Moran's I test for
   spatial correlation. The findings revealed moderate trends in annual and
   seasonal rainfall with an overall decrease in the annual mean rainfall
   trend. Seasonal patterns showed a divergence between the wet and dry
   seasons. Extreme precipitation indicators, represented by the maximum
   1-day rainfall, the number of rainfall events over 10 mm, and the 99th
   percentile, were projected to increase. Despite the size of the study
   area, the spatial correlation was weak for all the analyses. Regarding
   discharge, the Congo River basin showed an increase in annual mean,
   seasonal, and monthly trends. The Nile River Basin exhibited no
   significant trend. Extreme discharge indicators, represented by the
   minimum daily discharge each month, the minimum discharge for 7 days
   each year, and the frequency of the 10th percentile, exhibited
   significant positive trends in the Congo Basin. This study contributes
   to the growing body of knowledge on the impacts of climate change in
   Burundi and demonstrates the urgency for proactive measures to ensure
   the long-term resilience and sustainability of this region.},

Abstract = {Long-term precipitation monitoring plays a vital role in water resource
   management and disaster prevention and mitigation. This study assesses
   spatial and temporal trends in seasonal and annual precipitation in
   Pakistan between 1960 and 2016 at an interannual scale. The Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test, Sen's slope (SS) estimator, and Sequential Mann-Kendall
   (SQMK) test were employed to assess trends. Cluster analysis and
   L-moment approach were used to identify the homogenous precipitation
   regions. In general, increasing precipitation trends between 1960 and
   2016 were evident. Results indicated increasing precipitation in winter,
   autumn, summer and annual scale at the rates of 0.20, 2.18, 5.16, and
   10.89 mm center dot decade(-1), respectively. In spring, the
   precipitation trend shows a decreasing trend at -0.67 mm center dot
   decade(-1). Moreover, a significant decreasing trend occurred in winter
   in southern Pakistan. The overall increasing trends were more noticeable
   between 1960 and 1988, compared to the declining precipitation during
   1989-2016. SQMK analysis indicates a clear downward trend in most
   regions during 1989-2016, except in autumn. Annual precipitation has
   increased topographically except at 500 m and 1,500 m during 1960-2016
   with a significant increase of 1.37 mm center dot decade(-1) at
   elevation <250 m. Results indicate a negative correlation in SS test
   value with seasonal and annual precipitation with elevation and a
   positive correlation in winter. The seasonal and annual precipitation
   trends exhibit increasing and decreasing trends before and after 1990,
   respectively, in most subregions. The notable finding based on the
   outcomes of this study is that the whole country observed an increasing
   trend during 1960-1988, followed by a decreasing trend in during
   1989-2016. This decreasing tendency is particularly pronounced between
   1985 and 1995, except in autumn. Agriculture production is largely
   reliant on precipitation in many regions. So, a detailed study of the
   influence of monsoon trends and large-scale climatic variability
   controls over Pakistan is vital for improved water resource management
   in the context of global warming and rising human activity. The results
   will help policy makers while establishing and updating water-related
   initiatives and regulations.},

Abstract = {Climate warming will cause differences in precipitation distribution and
   changes in hydrological cycle both at regional and global scales. Arid
   lands of Central Asia (ALCA), one of the largest arid regions at the
   middle latitudes in the world, is likely to be strongly influenced by
   climate warming. Understanding the precipitation variations in the past
   is an important prerequisite for predicting future precipitation trends
   and thus managing regional water resources in such an arid region. In
   this study, we used run theory, displacement, extreme deviation theory,
   precipitation concentration index (PCI), Mann-Kendall rank correlation
   and climatic trend coefficient methods to analyze the precipitation in
   wet and dry years, changes in precipitation over multiple-time scales,
   variability of precipitation and its rate of change based on the monthly
   precipitation data during 1950-2000 from 344 meteorological stations in
   the ALCA. The occurrence probability of a single year with abundant
   precipitation was higher than that of a single year with less
   precipitation. The average duration of extreme drought in the entire
   area was 5 years, with an average annual water deficit of 34.6 mm
   (accounting for 11.2\% of the average annual precipitation over the
   duration). The occurrence probability of a single wet year was slightly
   higher than that of a single dry year. The occurrence probability of
   more than 5 consecutive wet years was 5.8\%, while the occurrence
   probability of more than 5 consecutive dry years was 6.2\%. In the
   center of the study area, the distribution of precipitation was stable
   at an intra-annual timescale, with small changes at an inter-annual
   timescale. In the western part of the study area, the monthly variation
   of precipitation was high at an inter-annual timescale. There were clear
   seasonal changes in precipitation (PCI=12-36) in the ALCA. Precipitation
   in spring and winter accounted for 37.7\% and 24.4\% of the annual
   precipitation, respectively. There was a significant inter-annual change
   in precipitation in the arid Northwest China (PCI=24-34). Annual
   precipitation increased significantly (P=0.05) in 17.4\% of all the
   meteorological stations over the study period. The probability of an
   increase in annual precipitation was 75.6\%, with this increase being
   significant (P=0.05) at 34.0\% of all the meteorological stations. The
   average increasing rate in annual precipitation was 3.9 mm/10a (P=0.01)
   in the ALCA. There were significant increasing trends (P=0.01) in
   precipitation in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, with rates of
   2.6, 3.1 and 3.7 mm/10a, respectively.},

Abstract = {Multi-decadal soil moisture trends and their relationships to
   precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (E) were explored in Mongolia.
   We modified a simple soil-moisture model intended for use in a wide
   range of practical applications for monitoring of pasture drought across
   the country, by incorporating soil freezing and snow melt. Daily soil
   moisture (W-m) was simulated using the model during 1961-2006 at nine
   stations distributed in the three different vegetation zones: forest
   steppe (FS), steppe (ST), and desert steppe (DS). The model performed
   reasonably well in simulating seasonal and interannual variations in
   observed soil moisture (W-o). The Wm was controlled by the subtle
   balance between P and evapotranspiration (E), which had in turn impacted
   on the vegetation during the growing season (May-September). All
   vegetation zones showed a decreasing trend in W-m during 1961-2006 due
   to decreased P and increased potential evapotranspiration, although the
   drying trend was only significant (p <0.05) in the FS. Composite
   analyses revealed that W-m anomalies were most manifested in summer due
   to large P and E anomalies, which were maintained throughout the
   freezing of winter into spring. In addition, autocorrelation analysis of
   W-m for the FS zone showed that during the autumn and winter, the
   temporal scale was 6.0-7.0 months larger than during spring and summer
   (1.8-3.0months). These findings indicate that W-m acts as an efficient
   memory of P anomalies via freezing of the soil and as an initial
   moisture condition for vegetation activity in the subsequent year.},

Abstract = {We present a long-term assessment of precipitation trends in
   Southwestern Europe (1850-2018) using data from multiple sources,
   including observations, gridded datasets and global climate model
   experiments. Contrary to previous investigations based on shorter
   records, we demonstrate, using new long-term, quality controlled
   precipitation series, the lack of statistically significant long-term
   decreasing trends in precipitation for the region. Rather, significant
   trends were mostly found for shorter periods, highlighting the
   prevalence of interdecadal and interannual variability at these
   time-scales. Global climate model outputs from three CMIP experiments
   are evaluated for periods concurrent with observations. Both the CMIP3
   and CMIP5 ensembles show precipitation decline, with only CMIP6 showing
   agreement with long term trends in observations. However, for both CMIP3
   and CMIP5 large interannual and internal variability among ensemble
   members makes it difficult to identify a trend that is statistically
   different from observations. Across both observations and models, our
   results make it difficult to associate any declining trends in
   precipitation in Southwestern Europe to anthropogenic forcing at this
   stage.},

Title = {Characterization of Spatio-Temporal Trends and Periodicity of
   Precipitation over Malawi during 1979-2015},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Precipitation remains the key climatic parameter in sub-Saharan Africa,
   as it drives the economy through rain-fed agricultural production.
   Malawi is one of the countries most susceptible to the impacts of
   climate change and variability. This paper presents the characteristics
   of spatio-temporal trends and periodicity of precipitation in Malawi in
   the period from 1979 to 2015. The analysis was based on recent rain
   ground gauge data. In total, 31 out of 36 rainfall stations, which
   include some key stations from the southeast of Malawi, were selected
   for the study after robust homogeneity tests were applied to the
   datasets. Spatial distribution of annual mean precipitation showed that
   high amounts of rainfall are located in areas along the lake and the
   southeast part of Malawi. The spatial distribution of the wet season
   (November to April) precipitation from EOF (Empirical Orthogonal
   Function) analysis revealed ten wet years (1985, 1986, 1989, 1996, 1997,
   1999, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2015) and ten dry years (1981, 1983, 1987,
   1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 2005, 2011, and 2014). In general, the temporal
   trends analyses of seasonal (wet season) and annual precipitations both
   displayed slight decreasing slopes during the 37 years. The trend of
   precipitation per decade displayed an increase in precipitation during
   1980s and 1990s, followed by a decrease in the 21st century.
   Furthermore, the analysis of the spatial and temporal variability and
   trends of rainfall showed that northern and central Malawi displayed a
   clearer variability than southern Malawi. Although the trends of most of
   the stations are not significant at 95\% confidence level, the
   decreasing rates of rainfall in the last decade and the decreasing
   trends on wet season and annual scale detected by Mann-Kendall tests
   require closer monitoring of rainfall changes in the near future. The
   stations which exhibited significant trends (Naminjiwa and Dedza
   stations) also call for closer monitoring, since the area relies heavily
   on rain-fed agriculture for economic sustenance.},

Abstract = {Sulfate and nitrate concentrations in precipitation from 1900 to 1980 at
   Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire are modeled using constant meteorology but

   to the annual average SO42- concentration increased steadily from 0.8 to
   2.0 mg/l-1 between 1900 and 1920 but remained fairly constant
   afterwards. The NO3- concentration increased steadily from 0.25 to 1.3
   mg/l-1 over the eight decades. Canada emissions in 1980 added about 17\%
   to the sulfate and 7\% to the nitrate concentrations. The estimated
   annual average pH of precipitation decreased from 4.7 in the beginning
   of the century to about 4.2 at present. These calculations are in good
   agreement with the measurements for the period 1964-1981.},

Title = {Precipitation Climatology for the Arid Region of the Arabian
   Peninsula-Variability, Trends and Extremes},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Arabian Peninsula is a region characterized by diverse climatic
   conditions due to its location and geomorphological characteristics. Its
   precipitation patterns are characterized by very low annual amounts with
   great seasonal and spatial variability. Moreover, extreme events often
   lead to flooding and pose threat to human life and activities. Towards a
   better understanding of the spatiotemporal features of precipitation in
   the region, a thirty-year (1986-2015) climatic analysis has been
   prepared with the aid of the state-of-the-art numerical modeling system
   RAMS/ICLAMS. Its two-way interactive nesting capabilities, explicit
   cloud microphysical schemes with seven categories of hydrometeors and
   the ability to handle dust aerosols as predictive quantities are
   significant advantages over an area where dust is a dominant factor. An
   extended evaluation based on in situ measurements and satellite records
   revealed a good model behavior. The analysis was performed in three main
   components; the mean climatic characteristics, the rainfall trends and
   the extreme cases. The extremes are analyzed under the principles of the
   extreme value theory, focusing not only on the duration but also on the
   intensity of the events. The annual and monthly rainfall patterns are
   investigated and discussed. The spatial distribution of the
   precipitation trends revealed insignificant percentage differences in
   the examined period. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the eastern
   part and the top half of the western Arabian Peninsula presented the
   lowest risk associated with extreme events. Apart from the pure
   scientific interest, the present study provides useful information for
   different sectors of society and economy, such as civil protection,
   constructions and reinsurance.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the changes in precipitation over summer and autumn
   across the Yunnan region of China, and undertook a composite analysis of
   the atmospheric circulations in the troposphere, which included an
   analysis of the interannual and interdecadal variations. This paper
   examines in detail the circulation backgrounds of the wet and dry
   periods in summer and autumn and their correlations with the sea surface
   temperature. The results indicated that the summer and autumn
   precipitation across Yunnan has significantly decreased over the past 50
   years. Furthermore, since the beginning of the century, the summer and
   autumn precipitation cycle has been in a low precipitation phase. The
   overlap of two extremely low rain phases has caused frequent droughts in
   the region. In addition, the atmospheric circulation fields during these
   wet and dry periods are very different. These are mainly shown as a
   meridional wind anomaly in eastern China in the low atmosphere, as a
   cross-equatorial airflow anomaly, a tropical zonal wind anomaly over the
   Indian Ocean, and as a related South Asia High and Western Pacific
   Subtropical High. Further analysis suggested that the SST over the
   Indian Ocean and the Pacific warm pool critically affect the anomalous
   summer and autumn precipitation over Yunnan by impacting the monsoon
   circulations. Future projections for greenhouse gas warming suggest a
   potential anomalous circulation background between 2010 and 2020 which
   may result in less precipitation during the wet season or even drought
   events across the Yunnan region.},

Abstract = {The spatial distribution and trends in the frequency of precipitation
   extremes over the last 44 years (1960-2003), especially since 1990, have
   been analysed using daily precipitation data from 147 stations in the
   Yangtze River basin. The research results are as follows: (1) The 15 mm
   precipitation isohyet approximately divides the precipitation extremes
   (corresponding to the 95 th percentile) of the stations in the middle
   and lower Yangtze reaches (higher) from those of the upper Yangtze
   reaches (lower). Also the starting time of the precipitation extremes in
   the middle and lower Yangtze reaches is earlier than of those in the
   upper Yangtze reaches. Precipitation extremes are concentrated mostly in
   June in the middle and lower Yangtze reaches, and July in the upper
   Yangtze reaches. (2) During the period 1960-2003, the first two decades
   had fewer precipitation extremes than the last two decades. There have
   been significant increasing trends and step changes in frequency of
   annual total precipitation extremes and precipitation extremes with a
   1-5 day gap in the middle and lower Yangtze reaches. Precipitation
   extremes occur more frequently in shorter periods, separated by a few
   days. Precipitation extremes are also becoming more concentrated in the
   month with the highest frequency of extremes (June) in the middle and
   lower Yangtze reaches. In the upper Yangtze reaches, there is an upward
   tendency of extreme events in June. Increasing precipitation extremes in
   June for both the middle and lower, and the upper Yangtze reaches will
   increase the probability of flooding if the observed trends of the last
   40 years continue into the future.},

Abstract = {Over the course of the 20th century, average annual precipitation for
   the contiguous USA has increased by nearly 10\%. This increase has been
   described as being dominated by `disproportionate' increases in extreme
   precipitation events. However. methodological constraints have
   confounded detailed interpretation of such results. Here. we, briefly
   de;scribe. those limitations and re-evaluate the nature of the observed
   precipitation changes using a method that allows for a more accurate
   examination of changes in the proportion of precipitation delivered in
   extreme daily events. We focus our analysis only on the trends in
   precipitation on the 10 wettest days of the year and compare the trends
   observed on those days with the trend in overall precipitation. When
   averaged across the USA, we find that the precipitation trends on the 10
   wettest days of the year are not significantly different front the trend
   in total overall precipitation. On a regional level. in the northeast
   and southeast there is some evidence that the rate of precipitation
   increase on the wettest jays exceeds that of total precipitation,
   whereas in the rest of the country the precipitation on the wettest days
   is increasing at a rate less than the increase in total precipitation.

   selected for their spatial and temporal representativeness. The long
   common period of seventy-five years (from January 1921 to December 1995)
   permits a reliable climatic investigation.
   The Wald and Wolfowitz (1943) test was applied to the series in order to
   detect serial correlation that could affect the subsequent trend
   analysis. Due to the long interval of time (one year) between
   consecutive data, the monthly total precipitation series for the
   different months showed no persistence. However, the annual total
   precipitation series showed a positive serial correlation.
   In order to detect possible trends in precipitation over the Iberian
   Peninsula, the Mann-Kendall test was applied to the annual and monthly
   series. This test is non-parametric and thus, has the advantage of being
   insensitive to the true (unknown) form of the distribution involved.
   No significant global trend was found in the annual total precipitation
   series. The only trend observed was a downward trend in twenty-one of
   the forty series of monthly total precipitation only for the month of
   March. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The biases and large-scale inhomogeneities in the time series of
   measured precipitation and snowfall over the United States and Canada
   are discussed and analyzed. The spatial statistical characteristics of
   monthly and annual snowfall and total precipitation are investigated and
   parameterized. After adjustments and selection of the `'best'' network,
   reliable `'first guess'' estimates of North American snowfall and
   precipitation are obtained. Century-long time series of unbiased annual
   precipitation over the regions to the south of 55 degrees N and 40-year
   time series of unbiased area-averaged annual precipitation and snowfall
   for all of North America are developed. The analysis of their trends
   shows the following. 1) During the last 100 years, annual precipitation
   has increased in southern Canada (south of 55 degrees N) by 13\% and in
   the contiguous United States by 4\%; however, the main domain of this
   century-scale precipitation increase is eastern Canada and adjacent to
   it northern regions of the United States. 2) Up to a 20\% increase has
   occurred in annual snowfall and rainfall during the last four decades in
   Canada north of 55 degrees N.
   The relationships between century-long precipitation time series over
   North America with Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature and the
   South Oscillation index (SOI) are investigated. It is shown that ENSO
   (negative anomaly of SOI) is usually accompanied by an increase of
   precipitation whenever it affects the United States (especially in the
   southwestern region of the country).},

Abstract = {Understanding the ongoing and possible future changes in monsoon
   rainfall is vital for the sustainable planning and development of
   Sudanese agriculture. This study uses monthly rainfall recorded at 22
   locations for the period 1960-2019 and future projections based on an
   ensemble of 3 global climate models (GCMs) for the period 2030-2089 to
   assess historical and future trends of rainfall in Sudan. Sen's slope
   estimator and Mann-Kendall (MK) test were used to estimate trends and
   their significance, respectively. The temporal coverage was divided
   equally into 30-year slices: periods A (1960-1989), B (1990-2019), then
   both combined into period C (1960-2019) for historical times, and
   periods D (2030-2059), E (2060-2089), and F (2030-2089) for the future.
   The future precipitation projection was evaluated from two Shared
   Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) from the
   Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). The results showed a
   countrywide decreasing trend in period A and an increasing trend in
   period B. The increasing trend in period B led to an overall positive
   trend for period C, except at a few stations. The future trend under
   SSP2-4.5 revealed a possible continuation of the cyclic pattern of the
   historical period. In contrast, SSP5-8.5 revealed a dominant increasing
   trend in rainfall for the period 2030-2089.},

Title = {Are climate model simulations useful for forecasting precipitation
   trends? Hindcast and synthetic-data experiments},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Water scientists and managers currently face the question of whether
   trends in climate variables that affect water supplies and hazards can
   be anticipated. We investigate to what extent climate model simulations
   may provide accurate forecasts of future hydrologic nonstationarity in
   the form of changes in precipitation amount. We compare gridded station
   observations (GPCC Full Data Product, 1901-2010) and climate model
   outputs (CMIP5 Historical and RCP8.5 simulations, 1901-2100) in real and
   synthetic-data hindcast experiments. The hindcast experiments show that
   imputing precipitation trends based on the climate model mean reduced
   the root mean square error of precipitation trend estimates for
   1961-2010 by 9\% compared to making the assumption (implied by
   hydrologic stationarity) of no trend in precipitation. Given the
   accelerating pace of climate change, the benefits of incorporating
   climate model assessments of precipitation trends in water resource
   planning are projected to increase for future decades. The distribution
   of climate models' simulated precipitation trends shows substantial
   spatially coherent biases, suggesting that there may be room for further
   improvement in how climate models are parametrized and used for
   precipitation estimation. Linear extrapolation of observed trends in
   long precipitation records may also be useful, particularly for lead
   times shorter than about 25 years. Overall, our findings suggest that
   simulations by current global climate models, combined with the
   continued maintenance of in situ hydrologic observations, can provide
   useful information on future changes in the hydrologic cycle.},

   Sul River Basin, Brazil},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The Paraiba do Sul River Basin (PSRB) is a vital source of water
   resources in Brazil, providing water for human consumption, industry,
   agriculture, and hydroelectric energy generation. As part of one of the
   most developed areas of the country, in the Southeast of Brazil, the
   region is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with evidence of
   extreme events such as droughts and floods affecting the availability
   and quality of water. Hence, this study analyzes precipitation and
   streamflow rates data from the PSRB between 1939-2020 to investigate the
   spatial variability of average patterns and extreme events, trends, and
   their relationship with urban growth and socioeconomic development. The
   analysis reveals significant spatial variations in precipitation and
   runoff rates, with higher altitude areas, such as the Serra da
   Mantiqueira, exhibiting higher average values. Moreover, the
   Mann-Kendall trend results showed in most of the sites no significant
   trend regarding precipitation data; however, about 50\% of the sites in
   the PSRB presented a decreasing trend of runoff rates. Since the
   precipitation does not explain identified changes in the hydrological
   patterns, the evaluation of the area's urban growth and socioeconomic
   development throughout the decades suggested that human activities, such
   as those associated with urbanization, have played a significant role in
   altering the runoff patterns in the basin. These findings highlight the
   importance of sustainable land-use planning and water
   resource-management practices in the PSRB to mitigate the negative
   impacts of urbanization on the hydrological cycle and to enhance the
   resilience of the region's water resources.},

   investigated by using the Student's t-test and 62 stations were found to
   show a significant difference in precipitation between El Nino and La
   Nina episodes. Most of these stations are concentrated in the Yellow
   River basin and Shandong Province. It indicates that the impact of ENSO
   on precipitation in these regions is greater than that in other regions
   of China. Average precipitation during El Nino and La Nina episodes, and
   the entire periods are compared. The results show that La Nina generally

Abstract = {Recent major floods in the French Mediterranean region prompted the

   Changes in monthly and annual maximum series from 92 precipitation
   gauges in the French Mediterranean region were examined. Each station
   provided a minimum of 56 years of daily measurements. Trends were
   searched for using the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and the
   maximum-likelihood parametric method. The main aim was to build two
   tests to estimate the regional significance of the local trends detected
   to allow estimation of whether local changes are due to chance or to a
   real climatic change. In Languedoc Roussillon, it was observed that
   monthly maxima have been decreasing in March and increasing in April.
   This can be explained by a transfer of rainy days from March to April.
   Significant increases were also detected in annual maxima and in monthly
   maxima in October, in the southern part of the Massif Central.},

Abstract = {Monthly and annual means of main anions (SO42-, NO3-, Cl-) and summed
   base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) in bulk precipitation were studied at
   10 stations during an 8-year monitoring period. The data showed
   statistically significant decreasing trends in most cases. Average
   declines of mean annual volume-weighted concentrations for both anions
   and cations were about two-fold. Despite the decrease, the loads of S
   and cations are still relatively high in Estonia (about 4-14 kg S ha(-1)

Abstract = {Planning and strategic management of water resources are contingent on
   trends in water availability. In this study, the impact of decade-scale
   variations in annual and seasonal precipitation on streamflow and
   evapotranspiration (ET) were identified for 10 watersheds in Nebraska,
   Kansas, and Oklahoma. In the Great Plains, an upward trend in
   precipitation over the last two decades of the 20th Century had a strong
   impact on streamflow and a comparatively weaker impact on ET. Even
   though precipitation, streamflow, and ET, amounts differed between
   watersheds, the trend due to the precipitation increase was similar for
   all watersheds. Increased precipitation led to a disproportionately
   large increase in streamflow and comparatively smaller increase in ET.
   On average, a 12\% increase in annual precipitation led to a 64\%
   increase in streamflow, but only a 5\% increase in ET. The seasonal
   partitioning of the annual precipitation increase was, in most cases,
   biased toward the fall, winter, and spring, with little or no change
   during the hot summer months. The strong streamflow response indicated
   that planning and management of surface-water storage and supply can be
   critically impacted by decade-long trends in precipitation. The lack of
   significant increase in precipitation and streamflow during summer
   suggests that any existing shortages will likely remain despite the
   observed annual precipitation increase. The ET response suggests that
   dryland farming and ecosystem vitality could benefit from the increased
   precipitation in fall, winter, and spring, but the relative impacts are
   more modest compared to the streamflow response and do not occur during
   summer when potential ET is greatest. Finally, since the mid-1990s
   precipitation and streamflow in a number of Oklahoma watersheds have
   shown a gradual decline from peak values in the late 1980s toward more
   average conditions. This declining trend in streamflow may be important
   for planning and management of water resources systems that must meet an
   increasing demand for water by a growing society while at the same time
   considering environmental and recreational needs.},

Title = {Long-term trends in extreme precipitation events over the conterminous
   United States and Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8, 2},
Pages = {2515-2527},

Abstract = {This paper describes the results of an analysis of trends in short
   duration (1-7 days) extreme precipitation events that have a recurrence
   interval of 1 yr or longer for stations in the United States and Canada.
   This definition of extreme precipitation was chosen because such events
   are highly correlated with hydrologic flooding in some U.S. regions, The
   dominant temporal characteristic of a national event composite index is
   significant low-frequency variability. There were lengthy periods of a
   below-average number of events in the 1930s and 1950s and an
   above-average number of events in the early 1940s, early 1980s, and
   1990s. Regional variations often differ substantially from the national
   composite. A simple linear analysis indicates that the overall trend
   covering the period 1931-96 has been upward at a highly statistically
   significant rate over the southwest United States and in a broad region
   from the central Great Plains across the middle Mississippi River and
   southern Great Lakes basins. The national trend for the United States is
   upward at a rate of 3\% decade(-1) for the period 1931-96. While the
   annual trend for Canada is upward for the period 1951-93, it is not
   statistically significant. Although the high statistical significance of
   the results is partially a consequence of the low frequency during the
   1930s and 1950s located in the first half of the record, the latter half
   of the record exhibits an upward trend nearly identical to the entire
   record. However, an analysis of a 101-yr record of midwestern stations
   shows that heavy precipitation event frequencies around the turn of the
   twentieth century (1896-1906) were higher than for other periods of
   comparable length, except for 1986-96. Although data were not available
   in digital form to extend the analysis back to 1896 for the entire
   United Stales, the midwestern analysis shows that interpretation of the
   recent upward trends must account for the possibility of significant
   natural forcing of variability on century timescales.},

   significant technology in the domains of energy conservation,
   environmental protection, and sustainable ecology, witnessing rapid
   advancements in recent years. Therefore, it is very important to
   understand the knowledge structure and development of this field
   comprehensively and systematically. Employing the bibliometric
   visualization tool CiteSpace, this study analyzes 1935 academic articles
   and reviews sourced from the core collection of the Web of Science (WOS)
   database. The analysis primarily encompasses collaboration networks,
   keyword co-occurrence, co-citation analysis, and cluster analysis. The
   results show that: (1) there are still many isolated nodes in authors,
   institutional and national networks, indicating that cooperation in this
   field continues to strengthen; (2) Hot topics include: bacteria,
   cementation, improvement, soil, sand and biomineralization, etc., which
   are high-frequency keywords in this field. In addition, terms such as
   biofilm, chemistry, calcification, and cementitious material emerge as
   highly influential keywords, reflecting the research hotspots in this
   field. (3) The co-citation analysis reveals interconnected topics in
   this field, such as biocemented sand, microbial-induced precipitation,
   engineered applications, microbial diversity, and self-healing concrete,
   these topics are current research hotspots. This paper is intended to
   serve as a comprehensive theoretical and practical resource for guiding
   future research in the MICP domain.},

Abstract = {Climate change is expected to significantly affect the precipitation
   regime of the Mediterranean basin where Turkey is located. This study
   investigates the trends of seasonal and annual precipitation time series
   of 29 rain gauge stations of the Turkish State Meteorological Service
   (TSMS) for the period 1955-2013, using two statistical tests based on a
   simple linear regression model and the well-known Mann-Kendall test. The
   non-parametric Sen's slope estimator was used to estimate the slope of
   the trend. The results of the trend analysis at the national scale for
   the entire period 1955-2013 revealed a clear significant upward trend of
   5.5\%/decade only for autumn precipitation. No significant trend was
   found in the annual and other seasonal time series. The investigation of
   abrupt precipitation changes in the series averaged over Turkey resulted
   in a distinct significant upward trend in autumn precipitation starting
   in 1984 and a downward trend in winter precipitation initiating in 1971,
   which, however, seems to start reversing after 1996. The influence of
   atmospheric circulation on the precipitation variability in Turkey was
   assessed using five atmospheric circulation indices: North Atlantic
   Oscillation Index (NAOI), Mediterranean Oscillation Index (MOI),
   Mediterranean Circulation Index (MCI), Eastern Mediterranean Pattern
   Index (EMPI) and North-Sea Caspian Pattern Index (NCPI). The analysis of
   the circulation indices revealed an important link between precipitation
   variability in Turkey and some atmospheric teleconnection patterns,
   expressed mainly by the indices of NAOI and MCI.},

Title = {Exploring the Spatio-Temporal Trends of Geomorphological Incidents
   Induced by Precipitation on Chinese Highways},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2024},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The spatiotemporal distribution of geomorphological incidents was
   examined in the present study, including the characteristics of
   obstruction distances and durations, by utilizing nationwide incident
   mitigation data and precipitation observation records from the period
   spanning 2019 to 2022. By comparing rainfall features over different
   temporal scales across various regions, the aim of the present study was
   to enhance the current comprehension of the patterns through which
   regional precipitation initiates incidents on highways by comparing
   rainfall characteristics over distinct temporal scales across diverse
   geographical areas. The findings indicate that: (1) The spatial
   distribution of highway incidents in China is significantly correlated
   with regional natural environments, predominantly concentrated in the
   southern parts of the country's second and third topographical terraces.
   The temporal distribution closely aligns with annual and monthly
   precipitation patterns, with the majority of occurrences taking place
   from June to September. Further, notable disparities in the distribution
   of highway-related incidents were observed among counties across most
   provinces; (2) National highways experience a notably higher frequency
   of incidents than expressways and provincial roads, with most
   obstruction lengths concentrated within 1 km and durations predominantly
   under 3 days; (3) The probability of daily rainfall inducing highway
   incidents is distinctly higher than that of short-duration rainfall,
   with eastern and southern China experiencing significantly greater
   inducing precipitation volumes than other regions. The majority of areas
   are susceptible to incidents within a 3-day window following heavy
   rainfall or within 24 h after intense short-duration rainfall. Moreover,
   it is observed that incidents are more closely associated with extreme
   precipitation occurring within a single day; (4) There is a certain lag
   between the timing of incidents and the occurrence of extreme
   short-duration heavy rainfall, with the highest frequency of incidents
   coinciding with continuous rainfall periods of 3 to 6 days.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},

Abstract = {Better understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of
   precipitation is essential in developing the best management practices
   for ecological restoration and soil erosion control on China's Loess
   Plateau, an arid and semiarid region with severe soil erosion. This
   study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal trends of precipitation using
   long-term precipitation data from 1957 to 2018 from the 100 national
   standard meteorological stations across the Loess Plateau. The
   nonparametric Mann-Kendall statistical test and geospatial interpolation
   were used to detect the trends and to analyze spatial patterns of annual
   and seasonal precipitation. Wavelet analysis was applied to examine
   periodical variation across the plateau. The results reveal that
   regional annual precipitation over the Loess Plateau decreased during
   the 62 years of the study at a mean rate of -1.05 mm/10 years (p > 0.1).
   The changes in annual precipitation showed a periodical fluctuation with
   an increasing trend from 1957 to 1969, a decreasing trend from 1970 to
   1999, and an increasing trend again in the first 18 years of the 21st
   century. The annual precipitation decreased in all eight sub-annual
   periods except for winter. Spatially, a decreasing trend occurred in the
   southern and eastern parts of the Loess Plateau, whereas a slight
   increase existed in the northwest in all periods. The decrease in six
   stations was statistically significant (p < 0.05), and a significant
   increase occurred in four stations (p < 0.1). These changes can be
   explained by an evident southward shift of the precipitation isohyets
   especially for 350 mm, 450 mm and 550 mm from the 1960s to the 1990s,
   and a clearly northward shift after the 1990s. Findings from this study
   facilitate an understanding of the spatial temporal trends of
   precipitation so appropriate countermeasures can be developed for
   effective vegetation restoration and soil erosion control across the
   Loess Plateau.},

Abstract = {Changes in rainfall characteristics over Mongolia and adjacent regions
   during summer were examined for the period 1960 to 1998, using daily and
   monthly precipitation data for Mongolia, China and the former USSR.
   Climatologically, mean summer (June to August) total precipitation was
   greater in northern Mongolia, and tended to decrease toward the south
   and southwest. Summer total precipitation contributed more than 60\% of
   annual precipitation in Mongolia. `Wet days' is defined as a day
   exceeding precipitation more than 0.1 mm. The number of wet days was
   approximately 40 days in northern Mongolia, while the number of wet days
   was less than 20 days in the south.
   Between 1960 and 1998, trends in summer total precipitation, the number
   of wet days in summer, and summer mean precipitation intensity were
   examined. The daily precipitation data were sorted into ascending order,
   and grouped into 10 classes which have an interval width equal to 10\%
   of total number of wet days. Summer total precipitation increased in
   eastern and western Mongolia. Trends in heaviest precipitation class
   were also evaluated. The amounts of precipitation in the heaviest
   rainfall class, also increased in eastern and southern Mongolia and the
   Altai Mountains. The number of wet days increased over almost all of
   Mongolia. The frequency of relatively heavy rainfall events increased in
   eastern and southern areas, whereas during the same period weaker
   rainfall events became dominant in the northern part of central
   Mongolia.},

Abstract = {The Souss-Massa region in southwestern Morocco is characterized by a
   semi-arid climate with high variability in rainfall. Frequent droughts
   and flash flood events combined with overexploitation of water resources
   in recent decades have had a significant impact on the human security
   and the economy which is mainly based on agriculture, tourism and
   fishery. For better management of extreme events and water resources
   under changing climatic conditions, a study was carried out to quantify
   the seasonal and annual variability and trends in rainfall and
   temperature over the past three decades with data from three stations.
   Climatological representative of the Souss-Massa region. The
   Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test and the Sen's slope are used to
   estimate the monotonic trend and magnitude of the trend of the
   variables, respectively. Statistical analysis of the rainfall series
   data set highlights that the occurrence of rainfall is unpredictable and
   irregular and the both the seasonal and annual rainfall trend appears
   negative (downward) for all the three climatological stations. The
   minimum temperature shows a remarkable increasing trend both on annual
   and seasonal scale while the maximum temperature registers a slightly
   increasing trend. The study presents some new insights on rainfall and
   temperature trends that will have significant impacts on the surface and
   groundwater resources of the region under changing climatic conditions.
   The results can help to prioritize new strategies to mitigate the risk
   of droughts, of floods and to manage water resources to sustain the
   dependence of agriculture tourism and fishery sectors in the region.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to present a precipitation trend analysis
   using gridded data at annual, seasonal and monthly time scales over the
   Fez-Meknes region (northern Morocco) for the period 1961-2019. Our
   results showed a general decreasing trend at an annual scale, especially
   over the mountain and the wetter parts of the region, which was
   statistically significant in 72\% of the grid points, ranging down to
   -30 mm per decade. A general upward trend during autumn, but still
   non-significant in 95\% of the grid points, was detected, while during
   winter, significant negative trends were observed in the southwest (-10
   to -20 mm per decade) and northeast areas (more than -20 mm per decade)
   of the region. Spring rainfall significantly decreased in 86\% of the
   grid points, with values of this trend ranging between 0 and -5 mm per
   decade in the upper Moulouya and -5 to -10 mm per decade over the rest
   of the region (except the northwest). At a monthly time scale,
   significant negative trends were recorded during December, February,
   March and April, primarily over the northeast Middle Atlas and the
   northwest tip of the region, while a significant upward trend was
   observed during the month of August, especially in the Middle Atlas.
   These results could help decision makers understand rainfall variability
   within the region and work out proper plans while taking into account
   the effects of climate change.},

Abstract = {High quality and long-term precipitation data are required to study the
   variability and trends of rainfall and the impact of climate change. In
   developing countries like Morocco, the quality of climate data collected
   from various weather stations faces numerous obstacles. This paper
   presents methods for collecting, correcting, reconstructing, and
   homogenizing precipitation series of Morocco's Fez-Meknes region from
   1961 to 2019. Data collected from national specialized agencies based on
   83 rain gauge stations was processed through an algorithm specially
   designed for the homogenization of climatic data (Climatol). We applied
   the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator to raw and homogenized
   data to calculate rainfall trend magnitudes and significance. The
   homogenization process allows for the detection of a larger number of
   stations with statistically significant negative trends with 95\% and
   90\% confidence levels, particularly in the mountain ranges, that
   threatens the main sources of water in the largest watershed in the
   country. The regionalization of our rain gauge stations is highlighted
   and compared to previous studies. The monthly and annual means of raw
   and homogenized data show minor differences over the three main climate
   zones of the region.},

Abstract = {In this study, annual and seasonal precipitation trend analysis was
   performed in the Euphrates-Tigris basin, Turkey, using innovative trend
   analysis (ITA) and discrete wavelet transformation. In this context, it
   was seen that there is a downward trend in winter, spring and annual
   precipitation, whereas precipitation has an increasing tendency in
   summer and autumn seasons, in the greater part of the basin. When annual
   and seasonal data were decomposed into wavelet components, the most
   significant trends were observed for high-periodic wavelet components,
   such as D3 (8-year), D4 (16-year) and D5 (32-year), where these
   components represent the periods of the precipitation data. Then, the
   relationship between North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and trend in
   precipitation was investigated. In this regard, it was found that there
   could be a significant relationship between the NAO and precipitation
   trends of the Euphrates-Tigris basin, especially in winter, based on the
   wavelet ITA.},

Title = {Mapping Evapotranspiration, Vegetation and Precipitation Trends in the
   Catchment of the Shrinking Lake Poopo},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Lake Poopo is located in the Andean Mountain Range Plateau or Altiplano.
   A general decline in the lake water level has been observed in the last
   two decades, coinciding roughly with an intensification of agriculture
   exploitation, such as quinoa crops. Several factors have been linked
   with the shrinkage of the lake, including climate change, increased
   irrigation, mining extraction and population growth. Being an endorheic
   catchment, evapotranspiration (ET) losses are expected to be the main
   water output mechanism and previous studies demonstrated ET increases
   using Earth observation (EO) data. In this study, we seek to build upon
   these earlier findings by analyzing an ET time series dataset of higher
   spatial and temporal resolution, in conjunction with land cover and
   precipitation data. More specifically, we performed a spatio-temporal
   analysis, focusing on wet and dry periods, that showed that ET changes
   occur primarily in the wet period, while the dry period is approximately
   stationary. An analysis of vegetation trends performed using 500 MODIS
   vegetation index products (NDVI) also showed an overall increasing trend
   during the wet period. Analysis of NDVI and ET across land cover types
   showed that only croplands had experienced an increase in NDVI and ET
   losses, while natural covers showed either constant or decreasing NDVI
   trends together with increases in ET. The larger increase in vegetation
   and ET losses over agricultural regions, strongly suggests that cropping
   practices exacerbated water losses in these areas. This quantification
   provides essential information for the sustainable planning of water
   resources and land uses in the catchment. Finally, we examined the
   spatio-temporal trends of the precipitation using the newly available
   Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS-v2)
   product, which we validated with onsite rainfall measurements. When
   integrated over the entire catchment, precipitation and ET showed an
   average increasing trend of 5.2 mm yr(-1) and 4.3 mm yr(-1),
   respectively. This result suggests that, despite the increased ET
   losses, the catchment-wide water storage should have been offset by the
   higher precipitation. However, this result is only applicable to the
   catchment-wide water balance, and the location of water may have been
   altered (e.g., by river abstractions or by the creation of impoundments)
   to the detriment of the Lake Poopo downstream.},

Title = {A Preliminary Analysis of the Relationship between Precipitation
   Variation Trends and Altitude in China},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-46},
Abstract = {Characteristics of the relationship between precipitation variation
   trends (PVT) and altitude were analyzed using monthly mean precipitation
   data from 526 observation stations in China from 1961 to 2008. With
   respect to elevation, China was divided into three subregions, below 200
   m, 200-1500 m, and above 1500 m. The results showed that the
   correlations between annual PVT and altitude are different among the
   three regions. In the region below 200 m in elevation, the best
   relationship has a correlation coefficient of -0.19 (0.49), passing the
   90\% (99.9\%) significance level south (north) of 35 degrees N. However,
   the correlation coefficient is close to zero, and the latitude strongly
   governs the spatial distribution of the amplitude of annual PVT in the
   200-1500-m elevation region. In most of the Tibetan Plateau, where the
   elevation is greater than 1500 m, there is a weak negative correlation.
   The Mann-Kendall method was used to test the trend of regional mean
   annual precipitation, which indicated that the annual mean precipitation
   had no obvious trend of change in China due to the reverse significant
   variation trends in different areas of the country.},

Abstract = {Rain gauge changes, changes in the number of observations per day, and
   inconsistent corrections to ob;served precipitation data during the 20th
   century of the meteorological network of the former Soviet Union make it
   difficult to address the issue of century time-scale precipitation
   changes. In this paper, we use daily and sub-daily synoptic data to
   account for the effects of these changes on the instrumental homogeneity
   of precipitation measurements over the Russian permafrost-free zone
   (RPF, most populous western and central parts of the country).
   Re-adjustments that were developed during this assessment allow us to
   (a) develop a system of scale corrections that remove the inhomogeneity
   owing to wetting/observation time changes over most of the former Soviet
   Union during the past century, and (b) to estimate precipitation trends
   over the RPF, reconciling previously contradictory results. The trend
   that emerges is an increase of about 5\% per century. This estimate can
   be further refined after a more comprehensive set of supplementary data
   (precipitation type and wind) and metadata (information about the
   exposure of meteorological sites) is employed. Copyright (C) 2001 Royal

Title = {Past and Future Precipitation Trend Analysis for the City of Niamey
   (Niger): An Overview},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite the interest in detecting the extremes of climate in the West
   African Sahel, few studies have been specifically conducted on the
   Republic of Niger. This research focuses on past, present, and future
   precipitation trends for the city of Niamey through the combined
   assessment of WMO precipitation indices using RClimDex and the
   Standardized Precipitation Index. Past daily precipitation data were
   derived from a 60-year reconstructed meteorological dataset for the
   Niamey airport station for the period of 1950-2009 and validated through
   comparison with an observed time series at Niamey airport (1980-2012).
   Precipitation analysis confirms the literature's findings, in
   particular, a decreasing trend in total precipitation over the period of
   1950-2009, and a positive trend for data that spans over the period of
   1980-2009, suggesting a precipitation recovery after the dry epoch
   (1968-1985), even if the deficit with the wettest years in the period of
   1950-1968 has not been made up. Furthermore,
   WATCH-Forcing-Data-ERA-Interim projections, elaborated under RCP 4.5 and
   RCP 8.5 socio-economic conditions, show that precipitation will increase
   in the future. Therefore, the Nigerien population will benefit from
   increased rainfall, but will also have to cope with the exacerbation of
   both flood and drought risks due to a great interannual variability that
   can positively or negatively influence water availability.},

Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},

Abstract = {Estimating the spatial distribution of long term precipitation plays a
   very important role in hydrological models that help us to understand
   climatic events. Since it is impossible to measure the amount of
   rainfall and temperature at every point within a geographic area,
   interpolation methods are used to model the surface of these data as
   continuous surfaces. The Thiessen method, which is one of the most used
   interpolation methods, was employed to compute spatially distributed
   monthly precipitation from long term precipitation data obtained from 35
   metrological stations scattered over the Marmara region. The
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and Sen's method were used to determine
   the presence of temporal trends in monthly aerial precipitation sets
   within the study area for a period of 32 years (1975-2006). The period
   was divided into two sections, 1975-2006 and 1985-2006. Trends in
   precipitation were identified in the 1975-2006 period but the test
   statistic values were not significant. For the 1985-2006 period, an
   increasing trend was identified for the months of August, September and
   February with a significance level of 0.05.},

Abstract = {Precipitation over a region plays vital role in determining availability
   of water resource whereas study of spatiotemporal distribution of
   rainfall helps in managing precipitation associated risks like drought,
   flood etc. . The present study is carried out in the state of Bihar,
   India using District-wise rainfall data of Bihar for period 1900-2022.
   AMajor findings of study indicate that CV and SD of monsoon season and
   annual rainfall are in a moderate range except for districts Begusarai
   and Jahanabad; however, CVs for pre-monsoon, winter and post-monsoon
   seasons were high for all the districts. Innovative trend analysis of
   the rainfall indicates either no trend or a negative trend except in few
   districts, and in recent years the negative trend is observed in almost
   all the districts. To understand homogeneity in rainfall, the
   precipitation concentration index (PCI) and its trend analysis performed
   through Mann-Kendall test. PCI analysis indicates irregularly
   distributed annual and uniformly distributed monsoon rainfall. High
   inhomogeneity in annual rainfall is due to the post- monsoon PCI
   contribution. PCI trend was found positive in the southern, extreme
   northern, and central parts of Bihar, whereas extreme west districts of
   Bihar like Aurangabad, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas and extreme eastern
   districts like Purnia, Katihar, Araria and Supaul had negative trend.},

Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This research was an attempt to understand spatiotemporal
   characteristics of stable isotopes in precipitation samples and their
   regional circulation patterns in Borneo. Two locations were selected in
   the Limbang River Basin (LRB). Monthly rainwater samples were collected
   from October 2016 to September 2017. Samples were analysed for delta H-2
   and delta O-18 isotopes. Local meteoric water line (LMWL) for two
   locations showed common source of moisture. delta H-2 and delta O-18
   composition did not show effect of temperature; but, inverse correlation
   with amount of rainfall was noted. The d-excess values more than 12\%o
   during northeast monsoon showed enhanced terrestrial recycled moisture;
   precipitation was inferred to be from evaporative moisture source during
   southwest monsoon with \~{}9\%o-\~{}15\%o d-excess. Average delta H-2
   and delta O-18 values from the International Atomic Energy Association/
   Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation stations of adjoining
   countries and LRB were considered to derive the regional meteoric water
   line for Southeast (SE) Asia. Comparison of LWML with global meteoric
   water line and available datasets from IAEA/GNIP locations showed the
   variation in rain events, evaporation effect, and change in source of
   atmospheric moisture. LRB slope value showed similar values with China,
   Indonesia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand, indicating similar
   meteorological trend and moisture source. Backward air mass movement
   trajectory indicated that predominant air mass reaching LRB were from
   the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and terrestrial source. Results pointed
   the need of detailed and site-specific collection of rainwater samples
   for long period to detect climate change over water resources in SE
   Asia.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to examine the spatial-temporal trends
   of precipitation coupled with oscillation periods in the Taihu Basin,
   China, during 1951-2014. We examine trends via the Mann-Kendall test and
   evaluate periodicities by wavelet analysis. Furthermore, the cokriging
   method is utilized to detect the spatial distribution. Continuous
   wavelet transform is also applied to determine the spatial distribution
   of the study area. The results show the following: (1) Three stations
   demonstrated significant increasing trends, while three other stations
   indicated significant decreasing trends, and the starting points of the
   trends fell within the period 1991-2001. (2) The decadal precipitation
   in the southwestern part of the basin decreased during the study period,
   while there was no apparent trend in the northeastern part. (3) The
   three significant periodicities of annual precipitation are 4 years, 17

Title = {Nonlinear Trends and Nonstationary Oscillations as Extracted From Annual
   Accumulated Precipitation at Mexico City},
Journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Extracted nonstationary oscillations and nonlinear trends of
   precipitation and sea surface temperature (SST) data reveal that
   rainfall variability in Mexico City is mainly composed by a long-term
   positive trend, a multidecadal oscillation highly correlated with the
   Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and year-to-year variability.
   The precipitation trend, lasting for more than a century, cannot be
   attributed to global warming or urbanization alone; rather, it can be
   thought of as part of a natural oscillation composed of alternating
   wet-dry anomalies with a period of a couple of centuries, as past
   evidence indicates. To further test the dependence of the AMO-related
   component, yearly SST time series were derived from a simplified model
   of the atmosphere-ocean system forced by white noise. The simulated SST
   time series exhibits AMO-like variability entirely consistent with the
   observed one, implying that North Atlantic SST multidecadal variability
   can be seen as the integrated response of surface ocean layers to
   external stochastic atmospheric forcing.
   Plain Language Summary In this work, nonlinear trends and nonstationary
   oscillations are extracted from both annual accumulated precipitation
   and sea surface temperature (SST) data. Our results show that the
   precipitation variability in Mexico City is mainly composed by a very
   long-term positive trend of more than a century, a multidecadal
   oscillation highly correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
   (AMO), and year-to-year variability. The long-term positive trend cannot
   be caused by global warming or urbanization alone; rather, it can be
   seen as the positive part of a natural oscillation composed of
   alternating wet-dry anomalies with a period of a couple of centuries, as
   there are past evidence supporting this interpretation. In order to get
   a depth understanding of the origin of the AMO-related component, yearly
   SST time series were obtained by using a simple box model of the
   ocean-atmosphere system forced by white noise (short timescale
   atmospheric forcing). This simple model is able to simulate SST
   anomalies that exhibit AMO-like variability that is entirely consistent
   with the observed one, implying that North Atlantic SST multidecadal
   variability can be seen simply as the response of near-surface layers of
   the ocean to stochastic atmospheric forcing.},

Abstract = {We investigate trends in monsoon and extreme precipitation in Nepal
   based on rain gauge measurements. We find that precipitation amounts in
   Nepal vary considerably in space and time. The number of occurring
   extremes and the amount of precipitation are controlled mainly by the
   Indian summer monsoon. Almost all extreme precipitation events, recorded
   by 98 considered meteorological stations, occur during the Indian summer
   monsoon with the maximum in July. For Nepal in general, we find that the
   amount of precipitation and number of extreme events per station are
   neither significantly increasing nor decreasing between 1971 and 2010.
   However, on a regional scale we identify areas with positive and
   negative trends. A comparison of the combined precipitation time series
   with the ENSO 3.4 index reveals a connection between ENSO and the
   variability in monsoon precipitation. The correlation with the number of
   monsoon extremes vanishes for increasing percentiles. We investigate
   trends of upper percentiles of daily precipitation which pinpoint
   regions of increasing and decreasing extremes. These patterns are
   similar to spatial patterns in mean monsoon precipitation trends,
   whereas the median of the precipitation distribution undergoes only
   minor changes. Further analysis using extreme value theory confirm the
   prevailing trends from quantile regression for most stations and depict
   strong changes in return levels. Especially for Far-West Nepal, we find
   robust evidence for a systematic increase in extreme precipitation.},

Abstract = {For climate change scenarios, there is a high degree of complexity, with
   impacts on the future availability of water resources. In this context,
   studies related to changes in rainfall time series are essential in
   order to identify environmental vulnerability. The objective of this
   study was to analyze trends in the rainfall regime, number of rainy days
   and temperature for stations located at different continentality and
   altitude conditions in Northeast Brazil. Meteorological data of the
   Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia were used, being classified according
   to the location in relation to the continent: coastal strip (14
   stations), strip of 150-300 km up to 300 m altitude (14 stations) and
   above 300 m (five stations), between 400 and 600 km from the coast up to
   300 m (four stations) and above 300 m (eight stations). All the 45
   stations used have a historical series with a data period of more than
   30 years. The trend of rainfall and rainy days was obtained through the
   Mann-Kendall and regression analyses, at significance levels of 0.01 and
   0.05, respectively. There were trends of reduction in the number of
   rainy days, in the coastal strip, as well as reduction in rainfall and
   rainy days, both in the strip of 150-300 km from the coast and in the
   Sertao region, with no significant effect of continentality in the strip
   of 400-600 km from the coast. For temperature, except for Maceio, AL,
   Brazil, there is a trend of increase in near future.},

Title = {Global Scientific Research and Trends Regarding Microbial Induced
   Calcite Precipitation: A Bibliometric Network Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Microbial induced calcite precipitation (MICP) offers a host of
   interesting features, from both theoretical and practical standpoints.
   This process was firstly investigated as a geo-biological mechanism
   involved in carbonate mineral formation in both rocks and soil. The
   interest in its practical use has significantly increased in recent
   years, as MICP has been used in different fields, such as oil recovery,
   the improvement of soil geotechnical characteristics, and concrete
   healing. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to
   carry out a bibliometric descriptive study of publications concerning
   MICP. We analyzed data from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC),
   which provides comprehensive information for bibliometric analysis,
   including the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) and the Social
   Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). The bibliometric analysis was carried
   out on 1580 publications, from 2000 to August 2022, and included
   publication output; author; institution; country; collaborations between
   authors, institutes, and countries; and citation frequency. We created
   visualization maps, including research collaborations, using the
   VOSviewer program. MICP, carbonate precipitation, cementation, and soil
   improvement in terms of geotechnical properties are frequently used
   keywords. Although in the year 2000, only two papers were published on
   MICP, the number of publications has increased rapidly since 2014. In
   2021, 333 papers were published. China leads the pack as the most
   productive country, followed by the USA and Australia. According to our
   results, the number of research papers has dramatically increased in the
   last 5 years. MICP use for concrete healing/cementation and soil
   geotechnical improvement, as well as the low environmental impact of
   such a technique, are becoming very popular topics among researchers.
   With the aging of concrete buildings, as well as with the worsening of
   environmental pollution and soil alterations, the research regarding
   MICP will play an ever increasing and crucial role in civil engineering
   and geotechnical fields, as well as in soil science. MICP also address
   Sustainable Development Goal 11, ``building sustainable cities and
   communities.{''} Nevertheless, our study pointed out a concentration of
   the MICP studies in just a few countries. Russia and Brazil, for
   instance, seem to poorly contribute to MICP research. Greater
   cooperation among countries, along with the extension of the research
   network on this topic, would foster more rapid progress in MICP studies,
   from both practical and speculative standpoints.},

Abstract = {This paper studies Chinese grape growers' time discounting and its
   implications for the adoption of technology that can reduce the negative
   effects of increasing precipitation. Using primary data collected in
   Xinjiang Province, we undertook a contingent valuation of rain covers
   that protect fruit from rain and estimated a discounted utility model
   using these data. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we find that
   local grape growers discount the future very heavily, with a discount
   rate of 0.17 per year, which is almost four times higher than the
   Chinese market interest rate. Farmers also tend to underestimate the
   benefits of adopting covers, with their purchase decisions appearing to
   largely depend on their past actual losses rather than future
   anticipated losses. These findings have broader implications for
   policies promoting proactive adaptation in response to likely increased
   rainfall in the region. Targeting farmers who give lower weight to
   events far off in the future and understanding that many farmers may
   tend only to make adoption decisions that have strong short-term
   benefits could improve the efficacy of climate policies that target
   agricultural technologies.},

Abstract = {The increased trends of extreme precipitation events over China have
   been partially attributed to global warming, while it is unclear how the
   natural climate variability affect these variations in extreme rainfall
   trends. Here we examine the contributions of large-scale modes climate
   variability from the Pacific Ocean, which are represented by El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO),
   on the trends of seasonal extreme events across China. Results show that
   the effects of climate variability modes on precipitation extremes
   exhibit evidently spatiotemporal characteristics at the seasonal scale.
   A significant positive trend is found over southeastern and northwestern
   China in four seasons, and substantial increases in two types of extreme
   events are also seen over northwestern China in spring and winter. Most
   of the seasonal trends of extreme precipitation events can be explained
   by the trends of the principal components. El Nino (La Nina) and
   PDO-like sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Pacific have a
   close linkage with the variations in precipitation extremes. By
   modulating the large-scale atmospheric circulations, these Pacific SST
   anomalies associated with climatic oscillations, such as ENSO and PDO,
   provide the conducive conditions responsible for the occurrences of
   seasonal precipitation extremes across China. The seasonal trends of
   extreme events can be largely explained by the variability of the ENSO
   and PDO episodes, with a relatively larger modulation of PDO as compared
   to ENSO. These researches have important implications for improving
   seasonal flood disaster predictability and climate model performances.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models in reproducing the variability
   and change of the austral summer precipitation observed in Southeastern
   South America (SESA) along the 20th century and beginning of the 21st.
   Models show a reduction in mean precipitation biases and inter-model
   dispersion, and a significant improvement in the representation of the
   leading pattern of precipitation interannual variability (EOF1), in
   comparison with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3) models.
   Changes of the EOF1 activity in the present climate, as represented by
   both, climate model simulations and rainfall gridded datasets, evidence
   an increase of the frequency of EOF1 positive events (associated with
   positive precipitation anomalies in SESA and negative ones in the South
   Atlantic Convergence Zone) and a decrease of the frequency of EOF1
   negative events. Nevertheless there are still large uncertainties due to
   model differences and the internal variability of the climate system. In
   order to reduce the impact of model uncertainties, an ensemble of the
   climate simulations that represent better the features associated with
   EOF1 activity was built, regardless to which model they correspond. The
   results obtained with this ensemble confirm that largest precipitation
   trends in SESA are those represented by climate simulations associated
   with an increase (decrease) of EOF1 positives (negative) events. It was
   also found that positive precipitation trends in SESA resulted from
   climate simulations forced by anthropogenic sources are the largest and
   significantly different from those from simulations forced by natural
   sources only, which are not significantly different from zero.},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Annual trends in extreme hourly precipitation time series were examined
   at 50 first-order weather stations across the southeastern United States
   from 1960 to 2017. Results indicated that the magnitude of annual
   maximum 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-h periods did not broadly change at the
   sites analyzed; however, the numerical value that defines a (station
   specific) 90th-percentile hourly accumulation significantly (p <= 0.05)
   increased at 36\% (18/50) of the stations. No station had a significant
   decreasing trend in annual 90th-percentile hourly event magnitude.
   Stations in Texas observed the largest increase in annual
   90th-percentile hourly event magnitude, where parameter estimates showed
   increases of 0.20\%-0.26\% per year. Annual average dry-spell duration,
   defined as the average number of hours between measurable precipitation
   events, significantly decreased at 18\% (9/50) of sites analyzed.
   Parameter estimates from regression performed on average
   dry-spell-duration time series showed decreases of roughly 0.11\%-0.19\%
   per year for the stations across southern Florida. Six stations across
   Georgia showed significant decreasing trends in the annual maximum
   consecutive hourly period with measurable precipitation (duration),
   demonstrating that the longest precipitation events that occurred at
   these stations have decreased in duration since 1960.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to determine the most dominant
   periodic components that affect the annual and seasonal precipitation
   trends in each homogenous rainfall region in the Langat River Basin,
   Malaysia for the period 1982-2011. Performing this research could be
   essential because in the previous studies on detection of trend in
   Malaysia, the details of variations of different time scales and the
   periodic responsible for the observed trends were not investigated.
   Using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coupled with Mann-Kendall at the
   regional scale for the first time particularly in the context of
   Malaysia is the contribution of this study. In order to form the
   homogenous rainfall regions, first the total annual and seasonal
   precipitation in each year was spatialized into 5 km x 5 km grids using
   the inverse distance weighting method. The obtained precipitation series
   for the grids were then grouped applying the Ward's clustering method
   based on the similarity of precipitation time series. After allocating a
   cluster number to each grid, the boundary of the regions was formed in
   ArcGIS software. Following which, in each homogenous region the areal
   precipitation series were computed by the Thiessen polygon method. The
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to detect trend and the DWT coupled with
   the MK test and the sequential MK analysis were then utilized in order
   to find out the time scale which affected the observed trend in each
   homogenous region. On annual scale, it was found that D-1 (plus
   approximation) component in regions Annual Cluster1 (AC1) and AC2 was
   the periodic mode responsible for trends. On seasonal scale, in regions
   Northeast monsoon Cluster 1 (NC1), NC3, SC1 and Southwest monsoon
   Cluster 2 (SC2), D-1 (with approximation), in regions NC4, Inter monsoon
   1 Cluster 1 (I1C1), I1C2, Inter monsoon 2 Cluster 1 I2C1 and I2C2,
   Detail 2 (D-2) (plus approximation) and in region NC2, Detail 3 (D-3)
   (with approximation added) component were the most influential
   periodicity for trends.},

Title = {Climate trends and behaviour of drought indices based on precipitation

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1481-1491},
Abstract = {Distinction between drought and aridity is crucial to understand water
   scarcity processes. Drought indices are used for drought identification
   and drought severity characterisation. The Standardised Precipitation
   Index (SPI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) are the most
   known drought indices. In this study, they are compared with the
   modified PDSI for Mediterranean conditions (MedPDSI) and the
   Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). MedPDSI
   results from the soil water balance of an olive crop, thus real
   evapotranspiration is considered, while SPEI uses potential (climatic)
   evapotranspiration. Similarly to the SPI, SPEI can be computed at
   various time scales. Aiming at understanding possible impacts of climate
   change, prior to compare the drought indices, a trend analysis relative
   to precipitation and temperature in 27 weather stations of Portugal was
   performed for the period 1941 to 2006. A trend for temperature increase
   was observed for some weather stations and trends for decreasing
   precipitation in March and increasing in October were also observed for
   some locations. Comparisons of the SPI and SPEI at 9- and 12-month time
   scales, the PDSI and MedPDSI were performed for the same stations and
   period. SPI and SPEI produce similar results for the same time scales
   concerning drought occurrence and severity. PDSI and MedPDSI correlate
   well between them and the same happened for SPI and SPEI. PDSI and
   MedPDSI identify more severe droughts than SPI or SPEI and identify
   drought occurrence earlier than these indices. This behaviour is likely
   to be related with the fact that a water balance is performed with PDSI
   and MedPDSI, which better approaches the supply-demand balance.},

Abstract = {To quantify the human-induced changes in precipitation and temperature,
   it is required to remove the natural climate variability from
   corresponding time series. Natural climate variability can be explained
   by the multi-scale variability of hydro-meteorological time series or
   the scaling effect, which denotes the invariance properties of a time
   series aggregated on different time scales. A number of studies have
   been carried out on rainfall and temperature trends in Bangladesh in
   recent years, but none of the studies considered the natural variability
   of climate that is present in time series in the form of
   auto-correlation that inflates the variance of the test statistics and
   changes the chance of significance. In the present paper the modified
   Mann-Kendall test, which can discriminate multi-scale variability from
   unidirectional trends, is used to analyse the trends in rainfall and
   temperature of Bangladesh over the period 1958-2007. The study shows
   that significant trends obtained in rainfall amount and extremes at many
   stations of Bangladesh by previous studies without considering the
   natural climate variability are due to the scaling effect. After
   removing the scaling effect, it was found that the annual rainfall only
   increased in north Bangladesh. Analysis of seasonal rainfall trends only
   shows a significant increase in pre-monsoon rainfall in Bangladesh.
   However, temperature was found to increase over the entire country, a
   similar trend to that suggested by other authors.},

Abstract = {In this study, satellite-based daily precipitation estimation data from
   precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using
   artificial neural networks (PERSIANN)-climate data record (CDR) are
   being evaluated in Iran. This dataset (0.25A degrees, daily), which
   covers over three decades of continuous observation beginning in 1983,
   is evaluated using rain-gauge data for the period of 1998-2007. In
   addition to categorical statistics and mean annual amount and number of
   rainy days, ten standard extreme indices were calculated to observe the
   behavior of daily extremes. The results show that PERSIANN-CDR exhibits
   reasonable performance associated with the probability of detection and
   false-alarm ratio, but it overestimates precipitation in the area.
   Although PERSIANN-CDR mostly underestimates extreme indices, it shows
   relatively high correlations (between 0.6316-0.7797) for intensity
   indices. PERSIANN-CDR data are also used to calculate the trend in
   annual amounts of precipitation, the number of rainy days, and
   precipitation extremes over Iran covering the period of 1983-2012. Our
   analysis shows that, although annual precipitation decreased in the
   western and eastern regions of Iran, the annual number of rainy days
   increased in the northern and northwestern areas. Statistically
   significant negative trends are identified in the 90th percentile daily
   precipitation, as well as the mean daily precipitation from wet days in
   the northern part of the study area. The positive trends of the maximum
   annual number of consecutive dry days in the eastern regions indicate
   that the dry periods became longer in these arid areas.},

Title = {USE OF CLIGEN TO SIMULATE DECREASING PRECIPITATION TRENDS IN THE
   SOUTHWEST OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},

Abstract = {CLIGEN is a stochastic weather generator to statistically reproduce
   daily weather variables. Weather observations from regions with
   significant climate variability could be used to determine how to
   manipulate the input to CLIGEN to simulate climate change scenarios.
   Most previous studies have used simplistic approaches, such as changing
   the average daily precipitation on wet days by a fixed percentage or
   multiplying the CLIGEN-generated daily precipitation by a fixed factor.
   The aim of this study was to develop a method based on available
   historical data to adjust CLIGEN parameter values when precipitation has
   gradually but significantly decreased. In the southwest of Western
   Australia (SWWA), annual precipitation has shown a significant
   decreasing trend since the mid-1920s. Although the annual precipitation
   has clearly decreased during the last 100 years, trends in monthly and
   daily precipitation are not as strong and consistent. This study focused
   on CLIGEN parameter values for the daily precipitation amount to
   investigate correlations between variations of daily and annual
   precipitation for SWWA. Long-term (90 years) daily precipitation data
   from seven rainfall stations in this region were used to examine decadal
   variations in precipitation and to evaluate the changes to CLIGEN
   parameter values with a gradual decrease in annual precipitation.
   Average precipitation on wet days, standard deviations, skewness
   coefficients, and probabilities of a wet day following a wet day and a
   wet day following a dry day were analyzed for each of the 61 overlapping
   time series of 30 years each for these sites in SWWA. This article shows
   that for the wet months in winter, there are similarities between
   statistically significant changes in annual precipitation and changes in
   mean daily precipitation, standard deviation, the probability of a wet
   day following a dry day, and mean monthly precipitation. There is little
   evidence to suggest the need to adjust skewness coefficients,
   wet-following-wet and wet-following-dry probabilities to simulate
   changes in the mean monthly precipitation for this region. Three
   regionalization methods developed and evaluated for adjusting CLIGEN
   parameters are the site-specific method, the average method, and a
   Wilgarrup method using the site with the most significant changes to
   adjust CLIGEN parameters. This article also shows a linear relationship
   between trends in the mean monthly precipitation and mean daily
   precipitation. These results indicate that CLIGEN parameter values can
   be adjusted to reproduce the declining trend for the region in SWWA.},

Pages = {77-91},
Abstract = {In the absence of a sufficiently dense network of climate stations
   covering all topographic regions of the Indus River basin and delivering
   high quality data over the last 30 years or more, daily precipitation
   data were obtained from the National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction-Department of the Enviornment (NCEP-DOE) Reanalysis 2 dataset
   for the period 1979 to 2011. The daily precipitation data were
   transformed into time series of frequency of extreme precipitation
   events of 1-day and 10-day durations defined in terms of 90th and 99th
   percentile threshold exceedances. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend
   test was applied to determine whether statistically significant changes
   in precipitation extremes occurred over time, in due consideration of
   autocorrelation in the data.
   Extreme precipitation showed a high spatial variability, with the
   highest daily and 10-day precipitation totals, and thus highest 90th and
   99th percentiles, in the southeastern lowlands at the foot of the
   Himalayas and the lowest in the Karakorum. Significantly decreasing
   trends in extreme precipitation were observed in the western part of the
   Indus River basin; significantly increasing trends were mainly detected
   in the very high mountainous regions in the east (Transhimalaya and
   Himalayas) and in the north (Hindu Kush and Karakorum) of the Indus
   basin. High precipitation rates are not common in the arid climate of
   these high mountainous regions. Future flood management plans need to
   consider the increasing trends in extreme precipitation events in these
   areas.},

Abstract = {The Wielkopolski National Park is a valuable fragment of nature not only
   from the national perspective; it is also an element of the European
   Ecological Network Nature 2000. For 20 years now the Ecological Station
   of Adam Mickiewicz University located there has been conducting
   systematic studies and monitoring of both, biotic and abiotic elements
   of the environment. One of the major threats to this area is pollution
   reaching the substratum in precipitation. The chapter presents the
   results of observations of bulk deposition and its physico-chemical
   properties, and tries to identify tendencies of change in its
   composition. It was found that over the study period the pH of
   precipitation tended to grow systematically. The year with the lowest
   figure was 1994 with the annual weighted mean pH of 3.92. In turn, the
   year with the lowest acidification was 2006 with a mean pH of 4.80. The
   predominant acid-forming ions were sulphates, with a maximum
   concentration even exceeding 40 mg dm(-3). Sulphate deposition was noted
   to show a downward tendency with time. It was found that due to
   intensification of transport in the vicinity and through the Park, mean
   concentrations of nitrates were on the increase, causing a change in the
   composition structure of precipitation. Some interesting data reveal
   fluoride ions, which are especially dangerous because of their specific
   character; their maximum concentration in bulk precipitation can reach
   0.41 mg dm(-3), Bulk precipitation measurements are accompanied by
   observations of throughfall, which show a substantial deposition of
   acid-forming ions. The electric conductivity of throughfall (with a mean
   of 77-150 mu S cm(-1)) varies much more widely than in open-terrain
   precipitation (with a mean of 30-40 mu S cm(-1)). The deposition of
   cations has been stable over the recent years and stays around 40 meq
   m(-2). Still, the research shows higher deposition levels of
   acid-forming compounds in the Wielkopolslci National Park than in
   Poland's and Europe's (EMEP) lowland stations monitoring background

   large-scale circulations are remarkably consistent with the observed
   changes in recent decades. Although we cannot directly attribute the
   observed changes to an anthropogenic GHG forcing, this result suggests
   that the observed drying trend over most of Europe might continue in the
   future. Our experiments additionally indicate substantial changes in the
   intensity and persistence of summer drought and flood. We identify the
   Central Mediterranean and Central/Western Europe to be especially
   vulnerable to increases in both summer drought and flood.},

Title = {Trend Analysis of Streamflows in Relation to Precipitation: A Case Study
   in Central Italy},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The monitoring of water resources is becoming increasingly important for
   humid temperate climates in light of climate change, which shows a
   generalised increase in temperatures and a decrease in precipitation,
   which is not generalised but relative to the area of interest. In this
   context, it is interesting to understand what the climatic changes have
   been, in terms of precipitation and how they have affected streamflows,
   by analysing them on a monthly basis. At the basin scale, interpolations
   were carried out with geostatistical methods using GIS software,
   spatialising the areal distribution of precipitation and obtaining an
   average value that can be correlated with water flows. As a pilot
   project, this research analysed the Upper Potenza basin in relation to
   the flow rates of the Potenza River over two reference periods, from
   1964 to 1979 and from 2005 to 2020. The results show a decreasing trend
   in streamflows within the studied basin, while the precipitation trend
   decreases for the period 1964-1979 and increases for the period
   2005-2020. Effective precipitation, in turn, shows a rather pronounced
   decrease in the more recent 2005-2020 period, due to climate change
   influencing the increase in temperature and consequently, the increase
   in evapotranspiration. In this context, it is significant to note that
   the Pearson correlation coefficient of streamflow to effective rainfall
   for both periods is about 0.8, suggesting that the net of anthropogenic
   disturbances, streamflow and actual precipitation maintain a high
   correlation. This model could be exported to other territories, in order
   to gain a global view for a better understanding and subsequent
   adaptation to ongoing climate change.},

Title = {Trends in extreme precipitation events (SW Hungary) based on a
   high-density monitoring network},
Journal = {HUNGARIAN GEOGRAPHICAL BULLETIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Climate change is commonly associated with extreme weather phenomena.
   Extreme weather patterns may bring prolonged drought periods, more
   intense runoff and increased severity of floods. Rainfall distribution
   is extremely erratic both in space and time, particularly in areas of
   rugged topography and heterogeneous land use. Therefore, locating major
   rainfall events and predicting their hydrological consequences is
   challenging. Hence, our study aimed at exploring the spatial and
   temporal patterns of daily rainfall totals of R >= 20 mm, R >= 30 mm and
   R >= 40 mm (extreme precipitation events, EPE) in P \& eacute;cs (SW
   Hungary) by a hydrometeorological network (PHN) of 10 weather stations
   and the gridded database of the Hungarian Meteorological Service (OMSZ).
   Our results revealed that (a) OMSZ datasets indicated increasing
   frequencies of EPEs for the period of 1971-2020 in P \& eacute;cs, (b)
   the OMSZ dataset generally underestimated EPE frequencies, particularly
   for R >= 40 mm EPEs, for the period of 2013 to 2020, and (c) PHN
   indicated a slight orographic effect, demonstrating spatial differences
   of EPEs between the two datasets both annually and seasonally for
   2013-2020. Our results pointed out the adequacy of interpolated datasets
   for mesoscale detection of EPE distribution. However, topographically
   representative monitoring networks provide more detailed microscale data
   for the hydrological management of urban areas. Data from dense
   rain-gauge networks may complement interpolated datasets, facilitating
   complex environmental management actions and precautionary measures,
   particularly during weather-related calamities.},

Title = {A Rigorous Statistical Assessment of Recent Trends in Intensity of Heavy
   Precipitation Over Germany},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {Comprehensive and robust statistical estimates of trends during heavy
   precipitation events are essential in understanding the impact of past
   and future climate changes in the hydrological cycle. However, methods
   commonly used in extreme value statistics (EVS) are often unable to
   detect significant trends, because of their methodologically motivated
   reduction of the sample size and strong assumptions regarding the
   underlying distribution. Here, we propose linear quantile regression
   (QR) as a complementary and robust alternative to estimating trends in
   heavy precipitation events. QR does not require any assumptions on the
   underlying distribution and is also able to estimate trends for the full
   span of the distribution without any reduction of the available data. As
   an example, we study here a very dense and homogenized data set of daily
   precipitation amounts over Germany for the period between 1951 and 2006
   to compare the results of QR and the so-called block maxima approach, a
   classical method in EVS. Both methods indicate an overall increase in
   the intensity of heavy precipitation events. The strongest trends can be
   found in regions with an elevation of about 500 m above sea level. In
   turn, larger spatial clusters of moderate or even decreasing trends can
   only be found in Northeastern Germany. In conclusion, both methods show
   comparable results. QR, however, allows for a more flexible and
   comprehensive study of precipitation events.},

Title = {Spatial trends of precipitation chemistry in the Central Plains region
   of the United States},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In the late 1970s, historically high concentrations of anthropogenic air
   pollutants in the United States prompted the development of the National
   Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). While
   much has been learned since program inception, many long-term data sets
   have yet to be interpreted, the results of which will help guide
   changing policies. Given the lack of studies in the Central Plains of
   the Midwestern United States, spatial trends of the past 30 years are
   presented from ten NADP sites surrounding, and including, Missouri, USA.
   Concentrations of calcium were highest (0.40 mg/L) and lowest (0.14
   mg/L) at north and southeast sites, respectively, with a westward trend
   of increasing concentration. Ammonium concentrations were highest (0.67
   mg/L) at northern NADP locations, with all sites showing an average
   increase in concentration of 65 \% from 1984 to 2014, including south
   central Iowa which showed an increase of 226 \%. Sulfate concentrations
   were highest for eastern sites (1.70 mg/L), but showed an overall
   decrease of at least 50 \% for all locations since the early 1980s.
   Nitrate concentrations decreased between 5 and 30 \% for each site over
   the 30-year period. Alkalinity increased between 10 and 25 \% from
   southern to northern sites, respectively. When grouped into north-south,
   and east-west regions, significant differences (p <= 0.05) were observed
   for all constituents, except potassium, between each region. Data
   syntheses, such as that presented here, advances understanding of
   long-term precipitation chemistry, thereby improving management
   strategies intended to mitigate atmospheric chemical deposition.},

Title = {Predictive Study on Extreme Precipitation Trends in Henan and Their
   Impact on Population Exposure},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {This study employs precipitation data sets from historical trials on 20
   CMIP6 global climate models and four shared socioeconomic pathway
   scenario trials (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) to predict
   trends in extreme precipitation changes in Henan Province
   quantitatively, while ascertaining the risk of population exposure to
   extreme precipitation in this area. The capacity of the CMIP6 models to
   simulate extreme precipitation indices from 1985 to 2014 is assessed
   using CN05.1 daily precipitation observational data. The correlation
   coefficients of the multi-model ensemble median's simulation of the
   extreme precipitation indices are approximately 0.8, with a standard
   deviation ratio closer to 1 compared with the single models,
   demonstrating superior modeling ability. Analyses using the multi-model
   ensemble median demonstrate an overall increase in the total amount,
   frequency, and intensity of extreme precipitation in Henan throughout
   this century, particularly in its southern regions; in the mid-century
   high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), the maximum increase in annual total
   precipitation exceeds 150 mm, and it can be over 250 mm in the
   late-century period. For the entire province, the maximum five-day
   precipitation increase relative to the historical period is nearly 25 mm
   in the late-century SSP5-8.5 scenario. The spatiotemporal concentration
   of precipitation will significantly increase, heightening the risk of
   flood disasters. Comparative analysis reveals that, under the same
   population prediction, the total population exposure will be higher in
   high radiative forcing scenarios than in low radiative forcing
   scenarios, especially in Kaifeng City, where the total population
   exposure in SSP1 and SSP5-8.5 exceeds that in SSP1-2.6 by 2 million
   person-days. However, in the same radiative forcing scenario, the total
   population exposure in the development pathway dominated by traditional
   fossil fuels (SSP5) will not be significantly higher than that in the
   sustainable development pathway (SSP1), indicating that population
   activity in this century will not be the main contributor to changes in
   total exposure. Overall, for Henan, in the same population forecast
   scenario, population exposure to extreme precipitation will gradually
   rise with global warming.},

Abstract = {Inter alia, inter-annual and spatial variability of climate,
   particularly rainfall, shall trigger frequent floods and droughts in
   Pakistan. Subsequently, a higher proportion of the country's population
   will be exposed to water-related challenges. This study analyzes and
   projects the long-term spatio-temporal changes in precipitation using
   the data from 2005 to 2099 across two large river basins of Pakistan.
   The plausible precipitation data to detect the projected trends seems
   inevitable to study the future water resources in the region. For,
   policy decisions taken in the wake of such studies can be instrumental
   in mitigating climate change impacts and shape water management
   strategies. Outputs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5
   (CMIP5) climate models for the two forcing scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP
   8.5 have been used for the synthesis of projected precipitation data.
   The projected precipitation data have been synthesized in three steps
   (1) dividing the area in different climate zones based on the similar
   precipitation statistics (2) selection of climate models in each climate
   zone in a way to shrink the ensemble to a few representative members,
   conserving the model spread and accounting for model similarity in a
   baseline period of 1971-2004 and the projected period of 2005-2099 and
   (3) combining the selected model's data in mean and median combinations.
   The future precipitation trends were detected and quantified, for the
   set of four scenarios. The spatial distribution of the precipitation
   trends was mapped for better understanding. All the scenarios produced
   consistent increasing or decreasing trends. Significant declining trends
   were projected in the warm wet season at 0.05\% significance level and
   the increasing trends were projected in cold dry, cold wet and warm dry
   seasons. Framework developed to project climate change trends during the
   study can be replicated for any other area. The study therefore can be
   of interest for researchers working on climate impact modeling.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to detect secular trends in observed,
   station-based precipitation variations and extreme event occurrences
   over the United States. By definition, detectable trends are those that
   are unlikely to have arisen from internal variability alone. To
   represent this internal variability, we use station-specific, seasonally
   varying, daily time scale stationary stochastic weather modelsmodels in
   which the simulated interannual-to-multidecadal precipitation variance
   is purely the result of the random evolution of daily precipitation
   events within a given time periodto first estimate the trends in various
   means and extremes that can occur even with fixed, climatological daily
   precipitation characteristics. Detection of secular trends in the
   observed climatewhether naturally or anthropogenically inducedcan then
   be defined relative to this stochastic variability, i.e., as trends in
   the means and/or extremes that are likely to have occurred only through
   a change in the underlying precipitation characteristics. The derived
   results have two important ramifications. First, they identify hot spot
   regions in which trends in precipitation characteristics are already
   emerging from within the envelope of stochastic variability, including
   (but not limited to) positive trends in annual occurrence across most of
   the U.S. and positive trends in annual intensity and heavy-event
   accumulations across the Interior Plains and around the Great Lakes.
   Further, they identify sentinel metrics which show the greatest
   detectabilitye.g., annual precipitation occurrence and intensityas well
   as those which show the least detectability and hence are unlikely to
   produce any statistically meaningful signalse.g., seasonal total
   precipitation and extremes.},

Abstract = {The ECHAM-4 global climate model, forced by time-dependent ocean
   boundary conditions and CO, concentrations, shows a substantial increase
   of precipitation in the Arctic during a simulation of the twentieth
   century. Observational data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change and other sources show a similar increase. The largest increases
   occur at nearly the same time in the observational data and the model
   output, implying that the ocean boundary conditions may be the primary
   driver of the increase. However, attribution to ocean boundary
   conditions is subject to the caveat that the largest increase of
   simulated precipitation occurs near the sea-ice margin, which contained
   essentially no interannual variability in the ECHAM-4 simulation during
   the first half-century (for which sea-ice data were sparse), after which
   time the model's sea-ice extent was prescribed to decrease
   substantially. Uncertainties in the precipitation data must also be
   addressed further before the observationally derived trend of
   precipitation can be considered to be robust.},

Title = {Seasonally Evolving Trends Explain the North-South Dipole Pattern
   Observed in Tibetan Plateau Precipitation},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},

Abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau (TP) precipitation is experiencing the north-south
   dipole tendency pattern since 1979. In this study, we identify four
   primary seasonally evolving patterns (SEPs) that explain approximately
   50\% of the total variance in precipitation variability over the TP.
   These SEPs contribute 60\%-90\% of the spatial mean amplitude of
   precipitation trends across seasons. In particular, the second SEP that
   features a north-south dipole pattern dominates the annual mean trend of
   the precipitation over the TP. The interdecadal variability of the
   seasonally evolving north-south dipole pattern is linked to the
   interdecadal variations of summer Silk Road Pattern and Indian monsoon.
   These findings suggest that the climate variability expressed through
   SEPs could potentially serve as a significant source for the
   interdecadal rainfall prediction.
   The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is experiencing the north-wetting-south-drying
   trend due to the imbalance of the Asian water tower since 1979,
   influencing the water supply to billions of people and regional and
   global climate. However, the characteristics of the seasonally evolving
   variations of precipitation across seasons on multiyear timescales, as
   well as the associated major circulation patterns, remain unknown. Here
   we identify four primary seasonally evolving patterns (SEPs) and focus
   on investigating their corresponding long-term trends and interdecadal
   variations. These four modes collectively contribute by 60\%-90\% of the
   spatial mean amplitude of precipitation trends across seasons. In
   particular, the trend of the second SEP that features a north-south
   dipole explains the spatio-temporal disparity of the total precipitation
   trend, displaying the strongest amplitude in summer over the TP. Our
   findings provide insight into the climate variability manifested in SEPs
   as a major source for the interdecadal prediction of rainfall evolution
   in the Asian water tower.
   Seasonally evolving patterns (SEPs) explain 60\%-90\% of the spatial
   mean amplitude of total precipitation trend over the Tibetan PlateauThe
   second SEP trend with a north-south dipole pattern mainly contributes to
   the spatio-temporal disparity of the total precipitation trendThe
   seasonally evolving north-south dipole trend is linked to the Silk Road
   pattern and the Indian monsoon variations},

Abstract = {Appraisal of spatio-temporal variability of precipitation is important
   for studying climate change and managing water resources. In this
   article, data on monsoon precipitation of Pakistan are analyzed for
   spatio-temporal interpolation using two hierarchical Bayesian
   spatio-temporal methods which are DLM and AR models. The precipitation
   records along with three meteorological covariates (temperature, wind
   speed and humidity) are collected from 53 stations for the years
   2000-2008. Initially, we simulated four data sets using AR model with
   four levels of autoregressive parameter rho = (0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and
   both models are fitted. It is observed that for the larger values of
   rho, DLM gives better results as compared to AR model while AR model
   performs better for the smaller values of rho. The estimated value of
   rho for precipitation data in the whole study domain is 0.02 which
   supports AR model for final spatio -temporal mapping. For real data
   application, data of 45 locations are used for modeling while data of 8
   locations have been set aside for cross validation and we use
   hyper-parameters a and b of inverse gamma distribution as variance
   parameters for AR and DLM models. The prediction performances of both
   models have been examined using Bayesian and non-Bayesian model choice
   criteria. The predictive inferences are drawn using MCMC algorithm.
   Prediction plots show that the areas that lie between 32 degrees-36
   degrees east latitude and 70 degrees -74 degrees north longitude are
   high precipitation areas in Pakistan and are helpful in the
   identification of homogeneous climate zones.},

Abstract = {Often it is claimed that the recent changes in northern European climate
   are at least partly anthropogenic even though a human influence has not
   yet been successfully detected. Hence we investigate whether the recent
   changes are consistent with regional climate change projections.
   Therefore, trends in winter (DJF) mean precipitation in northern Europe
   are compared to human induced changes as predicted by a set of four
   regional climate model simulations. The patterns of recent trends and
   predicted changes match reasonably well as indicated by pattern
   correlation and the similarity is very likely not random. However, the
   model projections generally underestimate the recent change in winter
   precipitation. That is, the signal-to-noise ratio of the anthropogenic
   precipitation change is either rather low or the presently used
   simulations are significantly flawed in their ability to project changes
   into the future. European trends contain large signals related to the
   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), of which a major unknown part may be
   unrelated to the anthropogenic signal. Therefore, we also examine the
   consistency of recent and projected changes after subtracting the NAO
   signal in both the observations and in the projections. It turns out
   that even after the removal of the NAO signal, the pattern of trends in
   the observations is similar to those projected by the models. At the
   same time, the magnitude of the trends is considerably reduced and
   closer to the magnitude of the change in the projections.},

Abstract = {Different types of South American annual precipitation series are
   analyzed for stations located south of the parallel 15 degrees S. It has
   been found that the most typical pattern of change in the long-term
   averages for 30-years consecutive series, corresponding to
   meteorological stations eastward of the Andes Cordillera, is represented
   by a. ``jump{''} or discontinuity which, for these stations, is always
   positive. The maximum signal is spotted between the 1950's and the
   1960's, showing the largest values on the continental zone of
   Argentina's territory. On the other hand, for stations on the windward
   side of the Andes, in Chile, the change is characterized by a decreasing
   tendency during the years, being steeper over the Northern dessert.
   Evidences of impacts produced by these changes are shown and possible
   physical causes of these long-term changes are inferred.},

Title = {Trend analysis of extreme rainfall indices from CHIRPS precipitation
   estimates over the Lake Tana sub-basin, Abbay Basin of Ethiopia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Ethiopia is among the African nations most susceptible to climate change
   because of its frequent droughts and heavy rainfall. Therefore,
   hydrological and water management problems require an investigation of
   regional variability and extreme rainfall patterns. This study analyzed
   the spatiotemporal trends of extreme rainfall in the Lake Tana sub-basin
   (LTSB) of Ethiopia's upper Blue Nile basin (UBNB) between 1981 and 2019.
   The trend and geographic patterns of ten extreme rainfall indices are
   evaluated using high-resolution data from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
   Precipitation Stations (CHIRPS). The researcher used RClimDex, an R
   software tool, to analyze the ten severe rainfall indices. The
   variability of the extreme rain indices was also assessed by applying
   the standard anomaly index (SAI). The trend analysis shows that the
   majority of rainfall indices decreased in the majority of station
   locations. Among the rainfall locations, the decreasing trend was only
   significant in 40\% consecutive wet days (CWD), 13.33\% (R95p and R99p),
   and 6.66\% highest rainfall amount in a 1-day period (RX1day). In
   contrast, significant positive patterns were revealed in the incidence
   of rainfall events of number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm), annual
   total wet day rainfall (PRCPTOT), and consecutive dry days (CDD), with
   significant positive trends of 26.66\% (R10mm) and 40\% (PRCPTOT).
   Furthermore, a spatial distribution result of extreme rainfall trends
   reveals considerable variations between stations location. Thus, these
   findings point to the necessity of creating adaptation and mitigation
   plans for climate change variability within the sub-basin.},

Title = {Seasonal trends in calcite-raft precipitation from cenotes Rainbow, Feno

Abstract = {Calcite-raft precipitation was monitored in three Yucatan cenotes
   (Rainbow, Feno and Monkey Dust) over a 2 year period. Site-specific
   variables including water temperature, relative humidity, water level
   and salinity were recorded as well as rainfall (Cozumel). Calcite-raft
   surface area was monitored through trail cameras that collected
   photographs every 60 min. Accumulation rates were recorded using
   sediment traps that were collected in May and December of each year.
   Calcite-raft surface area was calculated using an image segmentation
   procedure that identified the boundary of objects (edge detection) that
   share certain pixel characteristics, removed non points of interest and
   measured the sum of the area covered by the raft material. Results show
   that large rainfall events have a regional effect on the meteoric water
   mass (i.e. salinity), as well as the precipitation of calcite rafts. The
   large rainfalls and increased inflows cause dilution of the CaCO3
   supersaturated meteoric water mass and cause increased flow hindering
   calcite-raft precipitation for days to weeks after the rainfall. Raft
   precipitation gradually returns with deceasing flow after the event, and
   stagnation allows the recurrence of CaCO3 super saturation and
   accumulation of nucleation particles. Small rainfalls did not seem to
   have the same effect, as slower percolation of rainwater through the
   epikarst would be more saturated and micro-topographic relief may
   isolate the water pools from the lower flow. The sediment trap data
   shows that calcite rafts accumulate relatively constantly throughout the
   year in all three sites. Sedimentation rates from Feno and Monkey Dust
   responded to seasonal changes in surface-water disturbance associated
   with rainfall (wet and dry), although Rainbow didn't show any
   seasonality likely due to other site-specific factors affecting water
   disturbance (e.g. bats, wind).},

Title = {Rainfall distribution and trends of the daily precipitation
   concentration index in northern Morocco: a need for an adaptive
   environmental policy},
Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {A national priority at the Moroccan level is to understand the
   spatiotemporal rainfall irregularity to anticipate suitable strategies
   for water and agriculture management. The most northern mountainous
   region shows intense sensitivity to extreme hydroclimatic hazards which
   may compromise the future of socioeconomic acceleration and further
   weaken environmental balances. However, planning and decision making
   require accurate data, on a detailed scale and with good spatial
   distribution which is not the case in several south-Mediterranean
   countries where rainfall data and/or well-established
   hydro-meteorological network is lacking. In this paper, abundant rain
   gauge measurements combined with time-series open data (1958-2015) were
   used to study the rainfall variability. Results show an annual rainfall
   increase trend since 1996 with frequent, intense and abundant rains
   causing violent torrents and floods. This humid trend alternates with
   short but severe dry periods. Spatial distribution shows a rainfall
   increase from eastern to western area and from the coastal plains to
   high mountains. Based on a continuous daily rainfall dataset (from 1988
   to 2012) from six scattered stations, it appears that the pattern of
   heavy and extreme wet days takes the form of an irregular interannual
   cycle. Trends of the annual precipitation daily concentration indicate a
   significant positive trend in the center than in the East of the study
   area. Considering these observations, a review of water
   needs/obligations priorities seems crucial so that a new conscious and
   adaptative environmental policy would approve new procedures for a
   sustainable management.},

Abstract = {Changes of temperature extremes over China were evaluated using daily
   maximum and minimum temperature data from 591 stations for the period
   1961-2002. A set of indices of warm extremes, cold extremes and daily
   temperature range (DTR) extremes was studied with a focus on trends. The
   results showed that the frequency of warm extremes (F\_WE) increased
   obviously in most parts of China, and the intensity of warm extremes
   (I\_WE) increased significantly in northern China. The opposite
   distribution was found in the frequency and intensity of cold extremes.
   The frequency of high DTR extremes was relatively uniform with that of
   intensity: an obvious increasing trend was located over western China
   and the east coast, while significant decreases occurred in central,
   southeastern and northeastern China; the opposite distribution was found
   for low DTR extreme days. Seasonal trends illustrated that both F\_WE
   and I\_WE showed significant increasing trends, especially over
   northeastern China and along the Yangtze Valley basin in spring and
   winter. A correlation technique was used to link extreme temperature
   anomalies over China with global temperature anomalies. Three key
   regions were identified, as follows: northeastern China and its coastal
   areas, the high-latitude regions above 40A degrees N, and southwestern
   China and the equatorial eastern Pacific.},

Abstract = {Temperature change between neighboring days (TCN) is an important
   trigger for cardiovascular diseases, but the modulated effects by
   seasonal temperature trends have been barely taken into account. A
   quantified comparison between impacts of positive TCNs (temperature
   rise) and negative situations (temperature drop) is also needed. We
   evaluated the associations of TCNs with emergency room (ER) visits for
   coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebral infarction (CI) in Beijing,
   China, from 2008 to 2012. A year was divided into two segments dominated
   by opposite temperature trends, quasi-Poisson regression with
   distributed lag nonlinear models estimating TCN-morbidity relations were
   employed, separately for each period. High morbidities of CHD and CI
   both occurred in transitional seasons accompanied by large TCNs. Under
   warming backgrounds, positive TCNs increased CHD risk in patients
   younger than 65 years, and old people showed limited sensitivity. In the
   cooling periods, negative TCNs induced CHD risk in females and the
   elderly; the highest RR showed on lag 6 d. In particular, a same diurnal
   temperature decrease (e.g., - 2 degrees C) induced greater RR (RR =
   1.113, 95\% CIs: 1.033-1.198) on old people during warming periods than
   cooling counterparts (RR = 1.055, 95\% CIs: 1.011-1.100). Moreover,
   positive TCNs elevated CI risk regardless of background temperatures,
   and males were particularly vulnerable. Seasonal temperature trends
   modify TCN-cardiovascular morbidity associations significantly, which
   may provide new insights into the health impact of unstable weathers.},

   Temperature Trends},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The stratosphere and its dynamics are a very important part of
   atmospheric circulation. We need to analyze its climatology, as well as
   long-term trends. A long-term trend study needs homogenous datasets
   without significant artificial discontinuities. The analysis is based on
   the two newest released reanalyses, Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis
   (MERRA2) and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast
   Reanalysis (ERA5). The aim of this study is to detect discontinuities in
   the temperature time series from the above reanalyses with the help of
   the Pettitt homogeneity test for pressure layers above 500 hPa up to 1
   hPa in January and February, and show a comparison of temperature trends
   from the studied reanalyses and GPS radio occultation (GPS RO). We
   search for individual grid points where these discontinuities occur, and
   also for the years when they occur (geographical and temporal
   distribution). As expected, the study confirms better results for the
   Northern Hemisphere due to the denser data coverage. A high number of
   grid points with jumps on the Southern Hemisphere is found, especially
   at higher pressure levels (from 50 hPa). The spatial and vertical
   distribution of discontinuities is also presented. The vertical
   distribution reveals the reduction of the number of jumps around 10 hPa,
   especially for ERA5 reanalysis. The results show that ERA5 has
   significantly less jumps than MERRA2. We also study temperature trends
   from reanalyses and GPS RO and our analysis shows that the agreement
   between the reanalyses and observations are very good for the period
   2006-2018.},

Abstract = {We estimate trends of extreme daily precipitation (P95 > 95th

   Northwest Mexico during JJAS of 1961 1998. The intensity and seasonal
   contribution of P95 show significant upward linear trends in the
   mountain sites, which appear to be related to an increased contribution
   from heavy precipitation derived from tropical cyclones (TCs). Frequency
   of P95, total monsoon precipitation, and P95 in coastal stations did not
   change significantly. TC-derived P95 events are associated with SST
   anomalies similar to weak La Nina conditions in the eastern Equatorial
   Pacific, SSTs > 28.5 degrees C in the Caribbean Sea, and strong land-sea
   thermal contrast over Northwest Mexico and the U. S. Southwest two weeks
   prior to their onset. Citation: Cavazos, T., C. Turrent, and D. P.

Abstract = {Mediterranean region is one of the sensitive regions to climate
   variation particularly to precipitation changes in Turkey. In this
   study, trends in precipitation at annual, seasonal and monthly time
   scales for the period of 1963-2005 were examined for the Kahramanmaras
   along with Gaziantep and Adlyaman stations which are located in the
   continental Mediterranean precipitation regime region of Turkey.
   Non-parametric tests (such as Mann-Kendall and Sen's Slope), linear
   regression, cumulative deviation curve techniques were used to determine
   precipitation trends. The results showed that there is no statistically
   significant any trend in the study area, despite of slight precipitation
   increase for Kahramamnaras, slight decrease for Gaziantep and Adiyaman,
   annually. The year 1996 is the wettest year for all three stations, on
   the other hand the years 1996 for Kahramanmaras, 1970 for Adiyaman and
   1973 for Gaziantep are the driest years during the study period. Winter,
   spring seasons represent slight precipitation decrease for all three
   stations during the study period. Autumn showed increasing trend for
   Kahramanmara and Gaziantep even though which is not statistically
   significant. Most of the trends for individual months depicted
   decreasing trend but all are not statistically significant.
   Precipitation patterns, however, seems to have changed during the last
   43 years, and results of seasonal trends analyses seem to indicate that
   there has been a shift in winter precipitation seasonality toward Autumn
   months except Adiyaman station.},

Abstract = {A regional investigation of precipitation extremes could help the local
   authorities to develop strategies against potential climatic disasters,
   especially in regions of large climate vulnerability. In this context,
   this study focused on the homogeneity and trend analysis of eleven
   extreme precipitation indices from a daily rainfall dataset of rain
   gauges of the state of Ceara, located in the north of Northeast Brazil,
   from 1974 to 2018 at annual and seasonal time scales. The data were
   first submitted to gap-filling and quality control processes.
   Homogeneity, trend, and correlation coefficient were performed
   subsequently. Homogeneity results showed that most of the precipitation
   series were classified as ``useful. `` Significant break years in the
   series agreed well with moderate and very strong El Nino and La Nina
   events, suggesting a further investigation of this possible connection.
   Wet and dry day precipitation indices mainly indicated a decrease in the
   rainfall regime and an increase in dry days, mainly in the
   central-eastern, northwestern, and southern regions of the Ceara,
   especially during the annual time scale and the rainy season. The
   Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOWESS) curve showed changes in
   almost all series during the 1980s and 1990s, coinciding with the
   homogeneity breaks and years of severe droughts that strongly hit the
   region. Correlation coefficients were strong and significant between
   rainfall total index and the other precipitation indices.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to identify the trends of changes in
   atmospheric precipitation percolation under the changing climate
   conditions of Lithuania (the East Baltic region) based on long-term
   lysimeter studies. Data from 1987-2022 research (n = 1296) was used to
   determine trends in precipitation infiltration changes. Two 10-year
   periods, 1989-1998 and 2011-2020, were selected from the whole
   observation period (1987-2022) to assess changes in precipitation
   infiltration due to climate change. The air temperature has increased
   significantly in November (+3.4 degrees C) and December (+3.3 degrees
   C), with a +2.2 degrees C increase in the standard climate normal. The
   distribution of yearly precipitation has changed, with the annual amount
   decreasing from 686 to 652 mm. Precipitation increased the most in July
   and August (10.9 and 22.9 mm). In autumn, the amount of precipitation
   decreased by 7.9-31.1 mm. The number of rainy days did not change during
   the year, but the frequency of heavy precipitation increased
   significantly in August. The annual percolation increased by 14.2\% over
   2011-2020 compared to 1989-1998. Percolation increased by 19.0, 22.3,
   and 20.1\% during the spring, autumn, and winter, respectively, and
   decreased by 35.0\% in summer. The increase in annual percolation is
   mostly related to the increase in temperature during the cold season:
   November and December. During these months, the likelihood of early
   freeze formation, which interrupts gravitational water percolation in
   soil, is significantly reduced. In the spring, the increase in average
   air temperatures in March leads to faster melting of the winter snow in
   a shorter period, which significantly increases percolation processes.
   In Lithuania, higher percolation in autumn and winter, when part of the
   agricultural land is not covered by vegetation, may lead to higher
   leaching of chemical elements.},

Abstract = {One of the most relevant and debated topics related to the effects of
   the climate change is whether intense rainfall events have become more
   frequent over the last decades. It is a crucial aspect, since an
   increase in the magnitude and frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall
   events could result in a dramatic growth of floods and, in turn, human
   lives losses and economic damages. Because of its central position in
   the Mediterranean area, Sicily has been often screened with the aim to
   capture some trends in precipitation, potentially related to climate
   change. While Mann-Kendall test has been largely used for the rainfall
   trend detection, in this work a different procedure is considered.
   Precipitation trends are here investigated by processing the whole
   rainfall time-series, provided by the regional agency SIAS at a 10-min
   resolution, through the quantile regression method by aggregating
   precipitation across a wide spectrum of durations and considering
   different quantiles. Results show that many rain gauges are
   characterized by an increasing trend in sub-hourly precipitation
   intensity, especially at the highest quantiles, thus suggesting that,
   from 2002 to 2019, sub-hourly events have become more intense in most of
   the island. Moreover, by analysing some spatial patterns, it has been
   revealed that the south and the east of Sicily are more interested in
   significant increasing rainfall trends, especially at the 10-min
   duration. Finally, the comparison between the two procedures revealed a
   stronger reliability of the quantile regression in the trend analysis
   detection, mainly due to the possibility of investigating the temporal
   variation of the tails of precipitation distribution.},

Abstract = {In this study, the spatiotemporal variability of trends in extreme
   precipitation events in Ho Chi Minh City during the period 1980-2017 was
   analyzed based on several core extreme precipitation indices (Rx1day,
   Rx5day, CDD, CWD, R20mm, R25mm, R95p, and SDII). The non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope methods were used to compute the
   statistical strength, stability, and magnitude of trends in annual
   rainfall, as well as the extreme precipitation indices. We found that
   64\% of the stations had statistically significant upward trends in
   yearly rainfall, with high magnitudes frequently observed in the
   northern and southern regions of the city. For the extreme precipitation
   indices, only SDII and R25mm showed dominantly significant trends.
   Additionally, there were increasing trends in the frequency and duration
   at the southern and central regions of the city during the study period.
   Furthermore, El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation positively correlated with the duration and negatively
   correlated with the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation.
   Thus, water management plans should be adjusted appropriately to reduce
   the severe impacts of precipitation extremes on communities and
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Trends in return levels of 24-hr precipitation extremes during the
   typhoon season in Taiwan},

Abstract = {This study is to investigate changes in maximum 24-hr precipitation for
   20 stations during the typhoon season (July-October) and how the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may modulate precipitation extremes in
   Taiwan. Based on the non-parametric Mann-Kendall method and Sens's test,
   15 out of 20 stations (three fourth) exhibited an upward trend from 1958
   to 2013. Results of the field significance test suggest that the
   significant increasing trend is not caused by random variability.
   The method of the non-stationary generalized extreme value distribution
   (NGEV) is then applied to determine temporal changes in return levels.
   Results show that a large majority of stations are marked by an
   increasing trend in the three chosen return levels (2, 20, and 100
   years) over the last 56 years. Therefore, more intense typhoon producing
   seasonal maximum 24-hr precipitation has been observed in Taiwan. The
   waiting time for an extreme event to occur has shortened considerably in
   recent years. For stations located in western/central Taiwan, an El Nino
   (La Nina) event favours low (high) precipitation extremes. It is the
   opposite for stations in northern and eastern Taiwan. Thus, an east-west
   regional difference in precipitation extremes across Taiwan is noted. A
   NGEV model based on both time and ENSO as covariates is also applied.
   Inter-annual variations influenced by ENSO are more dominant than
   long-term trend in return levels for most stations in western/central
   Taiwan.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to study the temporal variability of
   precipitation time series of Tianchang County in Anhui Province, China
   to aid in the understanding of the state of the hydrology of the
   catchment. Trend analysis of one of the main component of the water
   balance of a catchment and a climate variable, precipitation was
   conducted with the aim of detecting a possible trend in the
   precipitation time series of Tianchang County, the non-parametric Mann-
   Kendall test was applied to precipitation series from 1951-2010 of
   Tianchang County. It was performed using Trend (version 1.0.2) to
   identify the significant positive or negative trends in the
   precipitation data if any. The 59 years period of precipitation data for
   the different towns in whole area showed, on the whole, some significant
   trend at an alpha level of 0.01 and 0.05 when grouped into the four
   seasons present in the area. The trend analysis revealed an overall
   upward and significant trend in five towns namely Datong, Xinjie,
   Shiliang, Qinlan and Tongcheng with downward statistically
   non-significant trend in the other ten areas .Using hypothesis testing,
   the null hypothesis states that there is no trend and alternative state
   there is a trend. From the results we reject the null hypothesis within
   the level of confidence 0.05 and 0.01. The rising rate of precipitation
   in some months and decreasing in others signifies an overall random
   pattern in the time series. This result is a part contribution to the
   effect of Climate change on hydrology and indicates that there is still
   room for research on the impact of climate change to ensure sustainable
   development in future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Volume = {589},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Estimation of reliable design discharges under variable climate is a key
   challenge for today's engineers. Therefore, researchers are intensively
   exploring different alternative approaches in order to improve standard
   methods for design discharge estimation. Paper investigates the
   performance of time-invariant, time trend- and precipitation-informed
   models based on generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution for 31
   Slovenian discharge gauging stations with data availability from 1961
   until 2015. Different rainfall durations are used as covariates in the
   case of precipitation-informed models. The selected catchments are
   located in different climate regions and characterized by five flow
   regimes. The results indicate that in most cases precipitation-informed
   models gave better fit to the measured data comparing to time-invariant
   and time trend-informed models. Relative differences in the design
   discharge estimations associated with 10- and 100-year return periods
   using time trend- and precipitation-informed models compared to
   time-invariant model were up to 60\%. Additionally, the results indicate
   that identified best-fitting model of individual gauging station can to
   some extent be related to its flow regime.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Changes in precipitation patterns were expected to have strong impacts
   on temperate ecosystem dynamics. North China has experienced opposite
   trends of precipitation change (increased in the west and decreased in
   the east) in the past several decades. Under such a background, we
   analysed mean growing season (GS) (April-October) grass Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) changes using combined dataset of
   Global Inventory, Monitoring, and Modelling Studies and Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI in North China during
   1982-2011. The results showed that in mean GS NDVI increased for
   grasslands in both Northeastern China (NE) and Northwestern China (NW).
   Increase in NDVI in NW was mainly due to the increase in precipitation
   (r = 0.50, p < 0.01). However, the decrease in precipitation did not
   cause a decrease in grass NDVI in NE, suggesting that precipitation is
   still higher than the most sensitive value and NDVI changes were
   significantly correlated with the increased temperature (r = 0.43, p <
   0.05).},

Abstract = {Changes in several components of the hydrological cycle over the
   contiguous United States have been documented during the twentieth
   century: an increase of precipitation, especially heavy and very heavy
   precipitation, and a significant retreat in spring snow cover extent
   over western regions during the last few decades. These changes have
   affected streamflow, including the probability of high flow. In the
   eastern half of the United States a significant relationship is found
   between the frequency of heavy precipitation and high streamflow events
   both annually and during the months of maximum streamflow. Two factors
   contributed to finding such a relation: 1) the relatively small
   contribution of snowmelt to heavy runoff in the eastern United States
   (compared to the west), and 2) the presence of a sufficiently dense
   network of streamflow and precipitation gauges available for analysis.
   An increase of spring heavy precipitation events over the eastern United
   States indicates with high probability that during the twentieth century
   an increase of high streamflow conditions has also occurred. In the
   West, a statistically significant reduction of snow cover extent has
   complicated the relation between heavy precipitation and streamflow.
   Increases in peak stream flow have not been observed here, despite
   increases in heavy precipitation events, and less extensive snow cover
   is the likely cause.},
