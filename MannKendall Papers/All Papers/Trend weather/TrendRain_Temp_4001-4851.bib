Abstract = {This work is a 7-year study of monsoonal rainwater chemistry (n = 302),
   over mid-Brahmaputra plain during 2012 to 2018. The samples were
   analyzed for major chemical parameters viz. pH, electrical conductivity
   (EC), and ions (SO42-, NO3-, Br-, Cl-, F-, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, NH4+, Na+,
   and Li+) to assess the chemistry. The mean pH of rainwater varied among
   the years, which was maximum in 2018 (6.18 +/- 0.72) and minimum in the
   year 2014 (5.39 +/- 0.54), and the variations were significant at p <
   0.0001. Ridgeline plots were drawn to visualize interannual variations,
   which revealed that Ca2+ was the dominant cation in the early years,
   whereas NH4+ prevailed in the latter years. Mann-Kendall analysis and
   Sen's slope statistical tests were employed, and it was found that all
   the ions showed positive S values indicating increasing trends.
   Enrichment factors (EF) of K+, SO42-, and NO3- were found to be high
   with respect to both soil and seawater suggesting the influence of
   emissions from fossil fuel and biomass burning in the chemistry of
   rainwater. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify
   the sources of rain constituents, and five factors were obtained
   explaining crustal dust, biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion,
   agricultural emissions, and coal burning as possible sources. Airmass
   back trajectory clusters and Potential Source Contribution Function
   (PSCF) were computed by application of HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian
   Integrated Trajectory model to appreciate the terrestrial influence on
   the chemistry. The results indicated inputs from both local and regional
   dust and anthropogenic constituents that influenced the monsoonal
   rainwater chemistry over Brahmaputra Valley.},

Title = {Identification of rainfall homogenous regions in Saudi Arabia for

Abstract = {In Saudi Arabia, identifying homogenous zones based on rainfall patterns
   is critical for ensuring a predictable and stable water resource and
   agriculture management strategy. As a result, the present research aims
   to identify Saudi Arabia's homogeneous rainfall zones and examine
   rainfall patterns in these areas. By proposing a novel trend analysis
   technique with a particular graphical representation, this study
   utilises and compares the traditional Mann-Kendall (MK) test, modified
   MK test, and basic Sen-innovative trend analysis (ITA) method. Another
   approach is to use the Pettit change point test to objectively identify
   subcategories as ``low{''} or ``high.{''} The applications are based on
   40-year rainfall records from 22 Saudi Arabian meteorological sites.
   K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering on principle component
   analysis (HCPC) were used to find homogeneous areas. The results of the
   homogeneous region identification revealed that the research area is
   divided into three clusters, each with three distinct climatic
   characteristics. Cluster 1 contains eight stations, whereas clusters 2
   and 3 each have seven. The results of trend identification utilising the
   MK, MMK, and ITA tests revealed that cluster 1 had a falling rainfall
   trend, whereas cluster 2 had a very minor decreasing and increasing
   rainfall trend. Cluster 2 can be thought of as a transition zone.
   Cluster 3 observed an upward trend in rainfall. While the proposed new
   form of ITA produced similar results with more detailed analysis such as
   change point-based high and low value identification, and magnitude of
   decreasing and increasing trend, the proposed new form of ITA produced
   similar results with more detailed analysis such as change point-based
   high and low value identification. This study will serve as a foundation
   for future work by scientists and planners on the identification of
   climatic zones, the development of trend detection techniques, and the
   formulation of water resource management strategies.},

Abstract = {Understanding past changes in the characteristics of climate extremes
   forms an essential part of viable countermeasures to cope with
   climate-induced risks in a rapidly warming world. Thus, this paper
   endeavored to explore possible non-monotonic trend components in heavy
   rainfall events over the Central Highlands (Vietnam) by employing Sen's
   innovative trend analysis method in conjunction with the well-defined
   extreme rainfall indices. The outcomes show less spatially coherent
   trends in the intensity, frequency, and duration of extreme rainfall
   events across the study area, and most analyzed indices exhibited
   non-monotonic trend forms. The overall trends in the intensity and
   frequency, represented by maximum 1-day, 5-day precipitation amount
   (Rx1day, Rx5day), very and extremely wet days (R95p and R99p), and the
   number of very and extremely heavy precipitation days (R20mm and R50mm),
   were characterized by significant increases at three or four sites.
   Concerning dry and wet extremes, observed increases in consecutive dry
   days (CDD) and decreases in consecutive wet days (CWD) were identified
   significantly simultaneously at three sites. There is high domination of
   significant increases in high-value subgroups of these indices. Several
   sites also exposed significantly increasing trend behaviors in these
   indices within all low-, medium-, and high-value subgroups, thereby
   implying the intensity and frequency have intensified over recent
   decades. This study also indicated potential linkages between annual
   peaks of several extreme rainfall indices, characterizing intensity,
   frequency, and wet duration, usually coincided with negative Indian
   Ocean Dipole and La Nina events, while dry extremes were usually found
   during El Nino events based on correlation analysis.},

Abstract = {A new approach for the modified method of innovative trend analysis
   (ITA) was applied to the categories of maximum daily rains coming from
   41 pluviometric stations of Macta (northwest Algeria) for the period
   1970-2010. Six categories of maximum daily rainfall were considered:
   light: 0-4 mm/day (A); mild to moderate: 4-16 mm/day (B); moderate to
   heavy: 16-32 mm/day (C-1); heavy: 32-64 mm/day (C-2); heavy to
   torrential: 64-128 mm/day (D-1); and torrential: equal to or greater
   than 128 mm/day (D-2). The results show that during the second period
   (1990-2010), increasing trends were detected in the middle categories B
   (most frequent: 20.78\%), C-1 (17.85\%), C-2 (20.21\%) and D-1 (4.92\%).
   In addition, migratory movements and rainy events towards the higher
   categories were detected (in particular towards C-1 (8.84\%)). These
   results show an increase in extreme rains in the Macta watershed during
   the period 1990-2010.},

Abstract = {In the present work, the variability, trends and relationships of
   aerosol, cloud and rainfall are explored for three regions of the Indian
   subcontinent: the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), central India (CI) and the
   North Indian Ocean (NIO). The investigated properties include the
   monthly averages of satellite retrievals for the aerosol optical depth
   (AOD), angstrom exponent (AE), aerosol index (AI), cloud effective
   radius (R-e), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud liquid water path
   (LWP) and rain rate (RR). Inter-annual and seasonal variability and
   long-term trends for these properties were analyzed over the regions
   selected. The analysis showed apparent regional and temporal variations
   in all seven parameters. Strong increases in aerosol properties over the
   IGP and CI regions over the last two decades have enabled the study of
   the response to cloud and rainfall properties. Further,
   aerosol-cloud-rain rate relationships during the summer monsoon were
   verified using linear fit analysis (using AOD {[}and AI], R-e, LWP and
   RR) for the three regions, respectively. A negative relation between AOD
   and R-e was seen over the three regions, whereas AOD and RR showed a
   negative relation over IGP and NIO. It was found that the AI property,
   which represents the aerosol number, is inversely correlated with R-e
   but positively correlated with RR during the monsoon season over the IGP
   and CI. AI and LWP showed a negative relation for CI but a positive
   relation for IGP and NIO. We believe that this study will help in
   assessing regional and global climate impacts due to aerosols.},

Abstract = {Global climate change will probably cause intensification of the

   properties. In this study, we investigated the trend of 5-, 10-, 15-,
   and 30-min annual maximum rainfall series at 12 stations in the Marmara
   Region, Turkey, using quantile regression. The data ranges were from 46
   to 71 years long. Five quantiles were used to examine the extreme
   rainfall series, and their quantile regression parameters were
   calculated. The results show that quantile regression is a powerful tool
   to compute trends with a more inferential context, which was validated
   with the notable differences between the trends at chosen quantiles and
   the classical ordinary least squares method. Concerning the problem of
   the analysis of climate trends, the quantile regression method seems to
   provide a perspective from a more detailed understanding of processes in
   the climate system in terms of characteristics of climate variability
   and extremity.},

   characterized by coarse time-resolution. In fact, in the scientific
   literature, there are many studies to verify the possible impacts of
   climate change on extreme rainfall, and particularly on annual maximum
   rainfall depths, H-d, characterized by duration d equal to 24 h, due to
   the significant length of the corresponding series. Typically, these
   studies do not specify the temporal aggregation, t(a), of the rainfall
   data on which maxima rely, although it is well known that the use of
   rainfall data with coarse t(a) can lead to significant underestimates of
   H-d. The effect of t(a) on the estimation of trends in annual maximum
   depths with d = 24 h, H-d=(24 h,) over the last 100 years is examined.
   We have used a published series of H-d=(24 h) derived by long-term
   historical rainfall observations with various temporal aggregations, due
   to the progress of recording systems through time, at 39 representative
   meteorological stations located in an inland region of Central Italy.
   Then, by using a recently developed mathematical relation between
   average underestimation error and the ratio t(a)/d, each H-d=(24 h)
   value has been corrected. Successively, commonly used climatic trend
   tests based on different approaches, including least-squares linear
   trend analysis, Mann-Kendall, and Sen's method, have been applied to the
   ``uncorrected `` and ``corrected `` series. The results show that the
   underestimation of H-d=(24 h) values with coarse t(a) plays a
   significant role in the analysis of the effects of climatic change on
   extreme rainfalls. Specifically, the correction of the H-d=(24 h) values
   can change the sign of the trend from positive to negative. Furthermore,
   it has been observed that the innovative Sen's method (based on a
   graphical approach) is less sensitive to corrections of the H-d values
   than the least-squares linear trend and the Mann-Kendall method. In any
   case, the analysis of H-d series containing potentially underestimated
   values, especially when d = 24 h, can lead to misleading results.
   Therefore, before conducting any trend analysis, H-d values determined
   from rainfall data characterized by coarse temporal resolution should
   always be corrected.},

Title = {Contributions of Seasonal Rainfall to Recent Trends in Cameroon's Cotton
   Yields},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cotton yields in the Sudano-Sahelian region contribute to food security
   through their role in agricultural productivity. Daily precipitation
   data and cotton yield data were synthesized from nine agricultural
   regions obtained from the ``Societe de Developpement du Coton
   (SODECOTON) ``. The following seasonal rainfall indices-from Cameroon's
   cotton zone-were mapped with geographic information systems for spatial
   analysis: wet season onset and retreat date, rainfall amount, number of
   rainy days, rainfall intensity (SDII), heavy-rainfall events (R95p),
   consecutive dry days (CDD), annual highest daily precipitation (Rx1day)
   and number of very heavy precipitation days (R20mm). Linear regressions
   were used as statistical tools for analysis. The strongest relationships
   were observed between cotton yields and the heavy-rainfall events,
   closely followed by seasonal rainfall amount. An increase in consecutive
   dry days (CDD) and heavy events, and a decreased seasonal rainfall
   amount, have a negative impact on cotton yield trends. Overall, the
   critical breakpoint analysis between cotton yields and all rainfall
   indices showed that the cotton yield was particularly negatively
   impacted before a 251 retreat date, 591 mm seasonal rainfall amount and
   33 rainy days. By contrast, an onset date, rainfall intensity, heavy
   rainfall, CDD, Rx1day and R20mm of 127, 12.5 mm center dot day(-1), 405
   mm, 27 days, 67 mm and 22 days, respectively, were identified for an
   optimum cotton yield. These results can be used as information for
   agricultural activity and management, civil planning of economic
   activities and can also contribute to furthering our understanding of
   the management impacts on future food security.},

Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Observed rainfall data (1961-2016) were used to analyze variability,
   trends and changes of extreme precipitation indices over Benin. Nine
   indices out of the ones developed by the Expert Team on Climate Change
   Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) were used. The results indicate a mix of
   downward and upward trends for maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) and
   maximum 5-days precipitation (RX5day). Decrease trends are observed for
   annual total precipitation of wet days (P), while significant increases
   are found for the simple daily intensity index (SDII). The number of wet
   days (RR1) and maximum consecutive dry days (CDD) show a mix of
   increase/decrease trends. However, the number of heavy (R10) and very
   heavy (R20) wet days and maximum consecutive wet days (CWD) show
   decreased trends. All wet indices increased over 1991-2010 in relation
   to 1971-1990. The increase in all wet indices over Benin could explain
   the intensification of hydrology, and the increase in the frequency and
   the intensity of floods. It caused damages such as soil erosion, crop
   destruction, livestock destruction, displacement of populations,
   proliferation of waterborne diseases and loss of human life. Some
   adaptive strategies are suggested to mitigate the impacts of changes in
   extreme rainfall.},

Abstract = {Study of rainfall pattern and trend in the long term is essential from
   climatic change and socioeconomic perspectives. In the present study,
   monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall of semi-arid regions (Madhya

   for the period of 1871-2016. The innovative trend analysis (ITA),
   Mann-Kendall test (MK) and Sen's slope estimator methods are used to
   check gradual change. A significant increasing or decreasing trend is
   not detected in the seasonal and annual rainfall series for any of the
   regions. The rainfall variability index indicates Madhya Maharashtra has
   received normal rainfall for 40\% of the time, Marathwada for 36\% of
   the time and Vidarbha region for 41\% of the time. Very dry and very wet
   conditions are experienced by all three regions for 15\% of the time.
   The spatial and temporal variation in the seasonal and annual rainfall
   is not significant in these regions. The results obtained from the study
   will be useful for water resource management of the Godavari basin.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is the key climatic variable, on which water availability, food
   security and livelihood depend, especially in an agrarian society like
   the northeast region of India. It is an ecologically sensitive zone,
   harbouring world's three biodiversity hotspots and the world's highest
   rainfall zone. Therefore, the assessment of variability and trend in the
   rainfall regime in this region is imperative. The present study focuses
   on testing the homogeneity status and prevalent trends in the long-term
   rainfall data at five different locations in North-East India, namely
   Cherrapunji, Dibrugarh, Guwahati, Kailashahar and Tulihal. The impact of
   rainfall variability on groundwater level was further investigated. The
   estimation of precipitation concentration index and standard
   precipitation anomaly was also carried out to investigate the
   intra-annual variability and drought conditions in this region. The
   results indicate the homogeneous nature of rainfall time series at 99\%
   significance level at all the sites with low coefficient of variance
   (CV, \%) at Dibrugarh in monsoon and annual rainfall series. The
   precipitation concentration index values show high intra-annual
   variability in the rainfall data. Decadal and annual standard
   precipitation anomaly values indicate the presence of extreme and severe
   drought conditions in the last two decades. The trend analysis results
   display the presence of significant negative trends in monsoonal and
   annual rainfall at Dibrugarh. During pre-monsoon season, all the sites
   exhibiting positive drift with only Guwahati and Tulihal have
   significant trends (at 90\% significance level). Monthly rainfall trend
   analysis results revealed strong and significant (95\%) negative trends
   during peak monsoon months of July at Dibrugarh and Guwahati and with
   85\% significance level at Cherrapunji (which was the world's highest
   rainfall zone in recent past). The impact assessment results indicate a
   direct association between rainfall and groundwater at lag2, i.e., the
   impact of any change in the rainfall amount on groundwater in a given
   area may be evident after two seasons. The results revealed an
   enhancement of 1.0 +/- 0.1, 1.1 +/- 0.2, 0.9 +/- 0.2 mm in the
   groundwater level for each mm increase in the rainfall at DBR, GHY and
   KSH, respectively. At CHR, the relation was evident only after 10
   seasons because of excessive rainfall and runoff. The results had
   significant bearing for the policy makers and farming community in the
   region for better planning of crop cultivation in order to adapt to the
   changing climate in this region.},

   rainfall was only observed for December and only in the west and
   northwest portion of the IRB. Average monthly streamflow showed a
   downward trend and followed downward trends in rainfall depth from the
   same month or the immediately previous one. Decreases of 25-40\% in
   minimum streamflow occurred in most sub-basins and dated mainly from the

Abstract = {The Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) characterizes the hydrometeorological
   variability across the north Indian region and contributes more than
   75\% of the annual rainfall during the monsoon (June-September) season.
   In the present study, we analysed the long-term monsoon rainfall for the
   Ganga River basin to investigate its spatio-temporal variability. A
   statistically increasing (10 to 17 mm/year; p < 0.05) trend has been
   observed in ISM rainfall for the mountainous region since 1980,
   accompanied by increased temperature. We further note that high, very
   high and extreme rainfall events are also increasing, enhancing the
   flash flood risk in the mountainous region. In contrast, the ISM
   rainfall in the alluvial region is observed to be statistically
   decreasing (-5 to -20 mm/year; p < 0.05) with the combined influence of

Abstract = {To meet the rising demand for uninterrupted high-speed broadband
   internet services, the deployment of highfrequency bands for the
   transmission of radio signals is inevitable. Unfortunately, attenuation
   due to rain droplets remains the most challenging factor impeding
   effective radio wave propagation especially in earth-space satellite
   links operating at Ka and V bands. It is important to understand the
   attenuation and the parameters that determine its magnitude in order to
   provide an effective solution to this problem. Rain height as one of the
   attenuation input parameters was examined in detail. A study of its
   temporal evolution reveals that seasonal variation is insignificant
   while the spatial variation shows that it increases from the Sahel to
   the Coastal Zone of Nigeria. The work provides comprehensive rain height
   and rain-induced attenuation contour maps. These maps are expected to
   serve as a database for link budget calculations for different areas in
   Nigeria. Rain-induced attenuation maps for 1\%, 0.1\%, and 0.01\% of
   time exceedance are provided at 20 GHz and 40 GHz for Ka and V band
   signals respectively.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is a major driver of food production in rainfed smallholder
   farming systems. This study was conducted to assess linear trends in (i)
   different daily rainfall amounts (<5, 5-10, 11-20, 21-40 and >40
   mm.day(-1)), and (ii) monthly and seasonal rainfall amounts. Drought was
   determined using the rainfall variability index. Daily rainfall data
   were derived from 18 meteorological stations in southern Africa. Daily
   rainfall was dominated by <5 mm.day(-1) followed by 5-10 mm.day(-1).
   Three locations experienced increasing linear trends of <5 mm.day(-1)
   amounts and two others in sub-humid region had increases in the >40 mm
   day(-1) category. Semi-arid location experienced increasing trends in <5
   and 5-10 mm.day(-1) events. A significant linear trend in seasonal
   rainfall occurred at two locations with decreasing rainfall (1.24 and 3
   mm.season(-1)). A 3 mm.season(-1) decrease in seasonal rainfall was
   experienced under semi-arid conditions. There were no apparent linear
   trends in monthly and seasonal rainfall at 15 of the 18 locations
   studied. Drought frequencies varied with location and were 50\% or
   higher during the November-March growing season. Rainfall trends were
   location and agro-ecology specific, but most of the locations studied
   did not experience significant changes between the 1900s and 2000s.},

Title = {Characterizing rainfall occurrence in India: Natural variability and
   recent trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {603},
Number = {B},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A deficit in rainy days can affect crop production and escalate
   groundwater abstraction leading to groundwater depletion, thus may
   threaten food and water security in the Indian subcontinent. The
   available researches on rainfall occurrence in India represent
   inconsistency in several fundamental considerations (spatial scale of
   analysis, the definition of rainfall classes, methods, dataset, study
   period, etc.) and lack of studies for non-monsoon seasons over large
   parts of the subcontinent. Here we attempt to deal with these
   inconsistencies by examining space-time patterns in seasonal count of
   rainfall events and their count in different rainfall classes during
   1951-2015 for all meteorological seasons of India using high resolution
   (0.25 degrees) gridded daily rainfall dataset. The results show a
   widespread decline in monsoon rainy days over major crop-growing regions
   including north-central, central, and northeast India. A reduction in
   rainy days is also observed over parts of central India in premonsoon;
   over north-central and northeast India in postmonsoon; and over
   peninsular India in winter. These trends are mainly observed in events
   with rainfall <95th percentile (light to heavy rainfall events) in all
   the seasons. Occurrence of extreme events (above 95th and 99th
   percentile) exhibits contrasting trends over different zones with mainly
   an increase over central and south-central India and decline over
   central-north India. However, trends in extremes are highly dispersed in
   space and are conclusive only over a few regions. The observed trends
   substantially deviate from the patterns reported in past studies for
   different regions. Rainfall occurrence in different meteorological zones
   also represents strong interannual and decadal variability, however, the
   observed trends have emerged beyond the inherent natural variability.
   The present findings provide an essential foundation for several future
   explorations with improved understanding of change in rainfall frequency
   and its possible impacts. It would also assist in developing a
   comprehensive framework for year-wide management of water resources and
   agriculture, considering all crop seasons.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES},

Abstract = {Study region: Upper Wabe Shebelle River Basin (UWSRB), Ethiopia.
   Study focus: This study investigated the spatio-temporal patterns or
   trends and spatial distribution and variability of rainfall in seasonal
   and annual time-series. The rainfall variability was evaluated by the
   coefficient of variation (CV), precipitation concentration index (PCI),
   and standardized anomaly index (SAI). The spatio-temporal trends were
   also analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test (MK), Sen's slope estimators
   (SSE), and the latest technique of innovative trend analysis (ITA)
   method was used for analyzing the low, medium and high rainfall
   clusters.
   New hydrological insight for the region: In most of the rainfall
   stations, high amount of annual rainfall happened in the Kiremt (wet)
   season, and high rainfall variability was during the Bega (dry) season.
   During the annual rainfall, the MK test and SSE were statistically
   non-significant in some stations, and heavy rainfall was detected in the
   Kiremt and Belg (transition) seasons. For the Kiremt and annual period,
   most rainfall stations showed high rainfall cluster and increasing
   trends, while low rainfall was observed in Bega season which exhibited
   decreasing trends. The outcomes of comparison revealed that the ITA
   method is more robust and surpassed the MK test as it could detect
   monotonic and non-monotonic trends that cannot be observed by the MK
   method. The result of this study is helpful for water resources planning
   and management in UWSRB.},

Abstract = {The pluviometric regime in the Western Mediterranean and concretely in
   Catalonia (NE Spain) is characterised by irregular amounts at monthly
   and annual scales, sometimes with copious short episodes causing floods
   and, conversely, sometimes with long dry spells exceeding 1 month
   length, depending on the chosen threshold level to define the dry
   episode. Taking advantage of a dense network of rain gauges, most of
   them with records length of 50-60 years and some others exceeding 85
   years, the evolution of these monthly and annual amounts is quantified
   by means of their time trends, statistical significance and several
   irregularity parameters. In agreement with the evolution of the CO2
   emissions into the atmosphere and the increasing concentration, in parts
   per million (ppm), of this greenhouse gas, different time trends at
   annual scale have been detected up to approximately years 1960-1970 in
   comparison with the interval 1960-1970 to nowadays. Consequently,
   besides the greenhouse effects on the temperature regime, the influence
   on the pluviometric regime could not be negligible.},

   indicators and trends},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Urban floods pose a societal and economical risk. This study evaluated
   the risk and hydro-meteorological conditions that cause pluvial flooding
   in coastal cities in a cold climate. Twenty years of insurance claims
   data and up to 97 years of meteorological data were analysed for
   Reykjavik, Iceland (64.15 degrees N; <100 m above sea level). One third
   of the city's wastewater collection system is combined, and pipe grades
   vary from 0.5\% to 10\%. Results highlight semi-intensive rain (<7 mm/h;
   <= 3 year return period) in conjunction with snow and frozen ground as
   the main cause for urban flood risk in a climate which undergoes
   frequent snow and frost cycles (avg. 13 and 19 per season,
   respectively). Floods in winter were more common, more severe and
   affected a greater number of neighbourhoods than during summer. High
   runoff volumes together with debris remobilized with high winds
   challenged the capacity of wastewater systems regardless of their age or
   type (combined vs. separate). The two key determinants for the number of
   insurance claims were antecedent frost depth and total precipitation
   volume per event. Two pluvial regimes were particularly problematic:
   long duration (13-25 h), late peaking rain on snow (RoS), where snowmelt
   enhanced the runoff intensity, elongated and connected independent
   rainfall into a singular, more voluminous (20-76 mm) event; shorter
   duration (7-9 h), more intensive precipitation that evolved from snow to
   rain. Closely timed RoS and cooling were believed to trigger frost
   formation. A positive trend was detected in the average seasonal snow
   depth and volume of rain and snowmelt during RoS events. More emphasis,
   therefore, needs to be placed on designing and operating urban drainage
   infrastructure with regard to RoS co-acting with frozen ground.
   Furthermore, more detailed, routine monitoring of snow and soil
   conditions is important to predict RoS flood events.},

Abstract = {Present study aims to explain the spatio-temporal variability of
   monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall trends at 12 districts of the
   Gangetic West Bengal (GWB), Eastern India, for the period 1901-2018. The
   Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT) and Jarque-Bera test have been
   applied to study the homogeneity and normality of the rainfall data
   series before applying suitable statistical techniques. Non-Parametric
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator are applied to detect the
   monotonic trend direction of rainfall occurrence and magnitude changes
   over 118 years on monthly, seasonal and annual basis. Spatial
   interpolation method is used to present the rainfall distribution
   pattern during the time period. The results show that in case of annual
   and monsoonal rainfall, the entire southern and south eastern part of
   Gangetic flood plain region have positive trend, while north and
   northwestern part of Rarh plateau region is characterized by negative
   trend. In winter season, the entire GWB have significant negative trend,
   especially in the north and western part of dry and red lateritic zone.
   A substantial declining rate of rainfall is recorded in the month of
   February (winter) and March (pre-monsoon) indicating that winter is
   becoming drier in nature. In the month of June (early monsoonal month),
   a decreasing trend of rainfall is prominent, whereas an increasing trend
   is observed in September (late monsoon) and October (early post-monsoon)
   almost in the entire GWB, which indicates the shifting of monsoonal
   character towards the post-monsoon season, i.e., monsoon is being
   delayed on its onset and offset timing. In red lateritic western plateau
   region, monsoon rainfall is dipping, whereas post-monsoon rainfall is
   increasing. In the alluvium flood plain and coastal deltaic region, both
   monsoon and post-monsoon rainfalls have increased over the 20th century.},

Title = {SPATIAL-TEMPORAL TREND ANALYSIS OF RAINFALL EROSIVITY AND EROSIVITY
   DENSITY OF TROPICAL AREA IN AIR BENGKULU WATERSHED, INDONESIA},

Abstract = {There have been many studies on rainfall erosivity and erosivity density
   (ED). However, it was not widely developed in Indonesia as a tropical
   country and has unique precipitation patterns. They are indicators for
   assessing the potential risk of soil erosion. The Air Bengkulu Watershed
   is undergoing severe land degradation due to soil erosion. This study
   aimed to analyze spatial-temporal in rainfall erosivity and ED based on
   monthly rainfall data (mm). The data used consisted of 19 weather
   stations during the period 2006-2020 and which are sparsely distributed
   over the watershed. The analysis was done by using Arnold's equation.
   Then, the trend was tested using parametric and non-parametric
   statistics, and analysed with linear regression equation, and Spearman's
   Rho and Mann Kendall's tests. The spatial distribution of both
   algorithms was analysed using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method
   based on the geographic information system (GIS). Unlike previous
   research findings, The long-term average monthly rainfall erosivity and
   ED revealed a general increase and decreasing trend, whereas it was
   found to be non-significant when both indices were observed. However,
   these results indicate a range from 840.94
   MJ.mm(-1).ha(-1).h(-1).a(-1)-, -552.42 MJ.mm(-1).ha(-1).h(-1).a(-1) to
   472.09 MJ.mm(-1).ha(-1).h(-1).a(-1) in that November month followed by
   December and April are the most susceptible months for soil erosion.
   Therefore, The upstream area of the region shows that various
   anthropogenic activities must be managed properly by taking into account
   the rainfall erosivity on the environment and that more stringent
   measures should be followed in soil and water conservation activities.},

Title = {Rainfall trend, variability and changes over the state of Punjab, India
   1981-2020: A geospatial approach},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {India is in the tropical monsoon zone receives most of the rainfall
   during the South West Monsoon (SWM) season, which lasts from June to
   September (JJAS). The SWM rainfall exhibits high spatial and temporal
   variability over the Indian subcontinent. There have been significant
   changes in SWM mean rainfall pattern and variability as a result of
   climate change. Moreover, the climate change has impacted the intensity
   and frequency of extreme rainfall events. In this study we used the
   Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS)
   is more than 30 years quasi-global rainfall dataset from 1981 to 2020
   for carrying out annual and SWM rainfall spatial and temporal
   variability over a total of 78 sub-districts (Tehsils) from 22 districts
   of Punjab state with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees.
   This study analyzed Tehsils' level rainfall using statistical
   non-parametric tests - the modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test and Sen's
   slope which revealed an increasing trend in annual and southwest monsoon
   rainfall over all the tehsils except Dhar Kalan Tehsil in the Pathankot
   district where as the decreasing trend in post-monsoon seasonal rain.
   The statistically significant increasing trend is observed over annual
   and monsoon rainfall over Punjab from the World Meteorological
   Organisation (WMO) standard period of 1981-2010 to 1991-2020. The annual
   precipitation has increased by 5.67\%, i.e., 32.18 mm, and monsoon
   rainfall has increased by 6.39\%, i.e., 27.45 mm over the state of
   Punjab from WMO standard period of 1981-2010 to 1991-2020.},

Volume = {25},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study aims to reduce crop failure resulting from a dry spell, which
   is the first occurrence of unsustainable rainfall that deceives farmers
   into planting. Thus, trends need to be tested using hypothesis,
   kurtosis, and other statistics to analyze the risks associated with
   unstable planting calendars and their possible mitigation strategies.
   The daily rainfall data from 1982 to 2018 were obtained from the archive
   of NASA/POWER SRB/FLASH, and the research location is Epe, Lagos State,
   Nigeria, which lies at latitude 6.585 degrees N and longitude 3.962
   degrees E. Microsoft Excel was used to perform the tests. Results show
   that the null hypothesis of no trend in the distribution was rejected on
   the basis of the fact that the probability value (p = 0.00) is less than
   the significance level (alpha = 0.05). The mean onset and cessation
   dates are March 27 and October 18, with skewness values of -0.63 and
   11.02, respectively. Rain onset and cessation that occur from February
   12 to April 27 and from September 28 to November 28, respectively, are
   safe with low risks of dry spell. Moreover, drought and dry spell were
   most probable in years that experienced a shorter length of wet season
   than dry season.},

Abstract = {Climate change is affecting all regions worldwide. Globally, polar ice
   shields are melting and the sea is rising. Moreover, some regions are
   facing more common extreme weather events and rainfall, while others are
   experiencing more extreme heat waves and droughts, causing changes in
   mean renewable water supplies e.g., precipitation and runoff. In this
   work, in order to detect possible rainfall trends in the Calabria region
   (southern Italy), a gridded database has been obtained from a rainfall
   data set of 129 monthly series collected for the period 1951-2016. In
   particular, the Inverse Distance Weighed was applied to build 603
   rainfall grid series with a spatial resolution of 5 km x 5 km and, for
   each grid point, the monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall series were
   analyzed with the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and the Theil-Sen
   estimator. Results showed a decreasing trend for the annual and
   winter-autumn rainfall and an increasing trend for the summer one.},

Abstract = {The Mahi-one of the major rivers in Western India-is subject to frequent
   major flooding, which severely affects the local economy and
   infrastructure. Little has been done, however, to assess the flood
   patterns and severity along its course. Here, the Mann-Kendall and
   Pettitt tests are used to identify long-term trends of precipitation and
   peak streamflow at multiple locations in the catchment. Then, flood
   susceptibility mapping is performed by the analytical hierarchy process,
   accounting for 14 geomorphic, hydraulic, and geologic factors. The
   analyses suggest a decline in total precipitation and peak flow
   discharges at most locations, consistently with the general climatic
   trend of the area, featuring a weakening summer monsoon. Nonetheless, a
   significant portion of the catchment area remains highly susceptible to
   flooding, with stream powers capable of mobilizing boulders up to 1 m in
   size in extraordinary floods. These results can support the work of
   engineers and policymakers dealing with floods in the study area, but
   the proposed methodology can also be applied to other fluvial catchments
   to evaluate the role of climate trends in modulating flood
   susceptibility.},

Title = {Dealing with trend uncertainty in empirical estimates of European
   rainfall climate for insurance risk management},
Journal = {METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The insurance industry uses mathematical models to estimate the risks
   due to future natural catastrophes. For climate-related risks,
   historical climate data are a key ingredient used in making the models.
   Historical data for temperature and sea level often show clear and
   readily quantified climate change driven trends, and these trends would
   typically be accounted for when building risk models by adjusting
   earlier values to render the earlier data relevant to the future
   climate. For other climate variables, such as rainfall in many parts of
   the world, the questions of whether there are climate change driven
   trends in the historical data, and how to quantify them if there are,
   are less simple to answer. We investigate these questions in the context
   of European rainfall with a specific focus on how to deal with the
   uncertainty around trend estimates. We compare 10 empirical
   methodologies that one might use to model and predict trends, including
   traditional statistical testing and alternatives to statistical testing
   based on standard methods from model selection and model averaging. We
   emphasize prediction and risk assessment, rather than detection of
   trends, as our goal. Viewed in terms of this goal, the methods we
   consider each have qualitative and quantitative advantages and
   disadvantages. Understanding these advantages and disadvantages can help
   risk modellers make a choice as to which method to use, and based on the
   results we present, we believe that in many common situations model
   averaging methods, as opposed to statistical testing or model selection,
   are the most appropriate.},

Abstract = {The trend analysis of historical rainfall data on monthly, annual and
   seasonal basis for three locations in lower Shivaliks of Punjab, viz.,
   Patiala-ki-Rao (1982-2015), Ballowal Saunkhri (1987-2015) and Saleran
   (1984-2017) has been done in the present study using linear regression
   model, Mann Kendall test and Sen's slope. Further, the data for annual
   and seasonal rainfall and rainy days has also been analyzed on
   quindecennial basis, i.e., for the period of 1986-2000 and 2001-2015.
   The analysis of data showed that annual rainfall in the region ranged
   from 1000 to 1150 mm. The trend analysis of the data shows that the
   monthly rainfall is decreasing at Patiala-ki-Rao and Saleran, however,
   the trend was significant for May at Patiala-ki-Rao; and in March and
   November at Saleran. At Ballowal Saunkhri, the decreasing trend is
   observed from May to October, however, the trend is significant only in
   August. The decrease in annual and monsoon rainfall is about 13 to 17 mm
   and 12 to 13 mm per year respectively at three locations in lower
   Shivaliks of Punjab. The highest annual (1600-2000 mm) and monsoon
   (1500-1800 mm) rainfall during the entire study period was recorded in
   the year 1988 at three locations. The decadal analysis of the data shows
   below normal rainfall during April to October. The analysis of the
   rainfall and rainy days on monthly, annual and seasonal averages of 15
   year basis showed that both rainfall and rainy days have decreased
   during the 2001-2015 as compared to 1986-2000 during all the seasons of
   the year.},

Abstract = {Trends of 15 extreme and non-extreme daily rainfall indices for Mexico
   and the southern United States are analyzed for the extended boreal
   winter (November-March) and summer (June-October) during 1981-2010. The
   analysis includes gridded observations (CHIRPS and Livneh), reanalyses
   (ERA5, ERA-Interim, MERRA2, and CFSR), the regional climate model
   RegCM4.7 (forced by ERA-Interim), and four general circulation models
   (GCMs) from the CMIP5 (HadGEM2-ES, CNRM-CM5, MPI-ESM-MR, and
   GFDL-ESM2M). The domain is divided into 13 regions with similar seasonal
   rainfall patterns according to the k-means algorithm applied to CHIRPS
   monthly precipitation, as a reference. Gridded observations and
   reanalyses (O\&R) show similar regional annual cycles and metrics of
   precipitation. The two observational data sets show the largest
   differences in the magnitude of some indices in the wettest region
   (southeastern Mexico) and in the monsoon. During summer, O\&R show
   positive significant trends in extreme rainfall indices in regions
   commonly affected by tropical cyclones (southern Baja California
   Peninsula, northeastern Mexico, and the southeastern United States),
   while negative significant trends of seasonal accumulation of rainfall
   are seen in the Mediterranean Californias and the Sonoran Desert region.
   There is an agreement among most data sets that the frequency and
   intensity of extreme winter precipitation indices have declined in
   northwest Mexico and the southwestern United States, but trends are not
   statistically significant, while southeastern Mexico shows significant
   increases in 5-days accumulation (rx5d). ERA5 followed by MERRA2 show
   the best performance. RegCM4.7 reproduces the annual cycle of
   precipitation in most of the regions and captures the main trend signals
   especially in winter, but it has difficulties in reproducing the summer
   interannual variability of few indices. The GCMs tend to overestimate
   (underestimate) the annual cycle of precipitation and the median values
   of extreme indices in the driest (wettest) regions. They are not able to
   capture the regional trends of the indices.},

Title = {Characterizing spatial and temporal trends in drought patterns of
   rainfed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) across various climatic conditions:
   A modelling approach},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Drought is considered one of the most common and challenging
   environmental stresses in the agricultural production worldwide. For
   improving the rainfed crop yields in the drought-prone environments,
   understanding the seasonal patterns of drought events in the target
   environments is crucial. This study applies the APSIM (Agricultural
   Production Systems sIMulator) crop model to interpret drought stress
   impact on a check genotype (early-maturity genotype) and mid- and
   late-maturity genotypes in 69 sites and 16 climate classes with climate
   data from over 37 years representing the rainfed wheat agro-ecosystems
   in Iran. Four drought patterns were recognized across the 16 regions.
   Water stress was dominant during grain filling (41 \%) and around
   flowering (56 \%) in studying regions. This stress varied over different
   genotypes and climate classes. Furthermore, results showed that under
   current management practices and using the check genotype, about half of
   the regions in the rainfed wheat agro-ecosystems of Iran (-1.7 million
   ha) are frequently subject to severe drought patterns (50 \%) resulting
   in a loss of grain yield of -2 t ha-1. Replacing a common genotype with
   an extra early-maturity genotype, however, reduced by 44 \% the
   occurrence of severe drought patterns which simultaneously increased the
   occurrence of light-moderate drought stress (i.e. DP1 and DP2) in the
   warm regions. In general, planting the extra early-maturity genotype had
   the advantage of producing higher yields in the driest regions. Sowing
   this genotype reduced the variability in grain yield and the frequency
   of severe drought patterns in the warm regions. On the contrary, in
   rainy and cold regions, the best-yielding genotypes were those with a
   longer growth period. Therefore, in rainy and cold regions with
   light-moderate stress conditions, the breeders should focus on
   earlymaturity and mid-maturity genotypes. Besides, it is suggested that
   the late-maturity genotype should be used in rainy regions with a
   reduced risk of drought stress.},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {East African countries (Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi)
   are prone to weather extreme events. In this regard, the past occurrence
   of extreme rainfall events is analyzed for 25 stations following the
   Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) regression
   method. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is used to show the future
   development of extreme rainfall events. Pearson's correlation analysis
   is performed to show the relationship of extreme rainfall events between
   different rainfall zones and their association with El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean dipole Mode Index (DMI). The results
   revealed that the consecutive wet days (CWD) index experienced a
   decreasing trend in 72\% of the stations analyzed. Moreover, the
   consecutive dry days (CDD) index also indicated a positive trend in 44\%
   of the stations analyzed. Heavy rainfall days index (R10mm) showed a
   positive trend at 52\% of the stations and was statistically significant
   at a few stations. In light of the extremely heavy rainfall index
   (R25mm), 56\% of the stations revealed a decreasing trend for the index
   and statistically significant trend at some stations. Further, a low
   correlation coefficient of extreme rainfall events between the regions
   (r(2) = - 0.27 to r(2) = 0.38) and between rainfall extreme indices with
   the atmospheric teleconnection indices {[}Dipole Mode Index (DMI) and
   Nino 3.4] ranging from r(2) = - 0.1 to r(2) = 0.35 was exhibited. Most
   rainfall zones showed a positive correlation between the R95p index and
   DMI, while 5/8 of the rainfall zones experienced a negative correlation
   between Nino 3.4 index and the R95p Index. In light of the highly
   variable trends of extreme rainfall events, we recommend planning
   adaptation and mitigation measures that consider the occurrence of such
   high variability. Measures such as rainwater harvesting, storage, and
   use during needs, planned settlement, and improved drainage systems
   management supported by accurate climate and weather forecasts are
   highly advised.},

Abstract = {The erosive capacity of precipitation depends on its intensity, volume,
   and duration. The rainfall erosivity factor (R) of the Universal Soil
   Loss Equation (USLE) requires high frequency (subhourly) data. When
   these are not available, R can be estimated from simplified indices such
   as the Modified Fournier Index (MFI), the Precipitation Concentration
   Index (PCI), and the Seasonality Index (SI), which are computed from
   monthly precipitation. We calculated these indices for 34 stations in
   the complex terrain Abruzzo region (central Italy) during 1980-2018,
   based on both gauge (point) and grid datasets. Using 30-min rainfall
   data of 14 stations, we verified that MFI and PCI are reliable
   predictors of R (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 163.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1)).
   For MFI, grid data do not capture the peaks in high-altitude stations
   and the low values in some inland areas, detected by the point dataset.
   Grid data show significant MFI positive trends in 74\% of the stations,
   while the point data display significant positive trends in only 26\% of
   stations and significant negative trends in four stations in the inland
   areas. The grid data complex orography requires preliminary validation

Abstract = {This study examined the variability and trend of rainfall over Horro
   Guduru Wollega Zone. Studies such as this have paramount importance in
   countries and areas where rain-fed agriculture is predominant. Datasets
   for analysis were obtained from the National Meteorological Agency of
   Ethiopia (NMA) from 1987 to 2016 and Climate Hazard Group InfraRed
   Precipitation (CHIRPS) 1987-2019 with the station portal. Monthly
   rainfall with temporal variability ranging from 9.77 to 141.93\% was
   observed. High variable (CV > 30\%) and less variable (CV < 20\%)
   rainfall was observed in the CHIRPS data records. Rainfall during most
   months of the last 30 and 33 years showed a decreasing trend. Rainfalls
   with temporal variability ranging from 12.7 to 75.92\% and from 8.11 to
   43.45\% were observed during the 3-month seasons, respectively. Rainfall
   over the 3-month seasons of the last 30 and 33 years showed a decreasing
   trend. The average total rainfall ranging from 107.203 to 1016.82 mm and
   from 122.8 to 1147.9 mm, with variability from 9.163 to 55.7\% and from
   7.831 to 36.68\% were observed during the Belg, Kiremt, and Bega seasons
   of the last 30 and 33 years, respectively. A decrease in rainfall was
   tested over these three seasons of the last 30 and 33 years.
   Significantly different (P < 0.05) and less variable (CV < 20\%) annual
   total rainfall was recorded at 24 stations over 30 years. Declining
   annual rainfall was observed over 30 and 33 years. Non-significantly
   different (P < 0.05) and less variable (CV < 20\%) average decadal
   rainfall ranging from 1342.6 to 1372.8 mm was observed during the last
   33 years. The study area had experienced a rainfall with decreasing
   trends almost over all time scales. These might have been resulting in
   failure of agricultural production that necessitates developing and
   implementing systematic planning and management activities in the crop
   calendar under the face of changing rainfall patterns.},

Abstract = {Taiwan regularly experiences precipitation extremes of hundreds of
   millimeters per day, especially between May and September. In this
   study, Taiwan's extreme rainfall (ER) is analyzed over a 56-yr time
   period in different seasons and geographic regions, using a recently
   released, high-resolution gridded rainfall dataset. ER is defined using
   a seasonally and geographically varying 99th-percentile threshold to
   better resolve the characteristics of the most intense rainfall seen in
   different locations and times of year. The resulting monthly ER rates
   are largest in typhoon season and smallest in fall, winter, and spring.
   ER is spatially homogeneous in the mei-yu and typhoon seasons and
   concentrated in northern Taiwan during the rest of the year. A trend
   analysis revealed a positive trend in island-mean ER for the winter,
   spring, and typhoon seasons. In winter and spring, these trends are most
   pronounced in the north. In the mei-yu season, ER has increased most
   over the southwestern mountain slopes; in typhoon season, ER has
   increased consistently over much of Taiwan. These changes often exceed
   1\% yr(-1). In many areas, typhoon season accounts for the largest
   fraction of the observed annual ER trend. TCs produce most of the
   observed typhoon season ER and ER trend, with nearly half of the typhoon
   season ER trend being associated with increases in TC frequency and
   duration around central and northern Taiwan. Certain regional changes in
   ER characteristics, particularly in areas with low sample size or
   complex seasonal contributions, merit further investigation in future
   work.},

Title = {Modelling Long-Term Monthly Rainfall Variability in Selected Provinces
   of South Africa: Trend and Extreme Value Analysis Approaches},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Extreme rainfall events have made significant damages to properties,
   public infrastructure and agriculture in some provinces of South Africa
   notably in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng among others. The general global
   increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events
   in recent years is raising a concern that human activities might be
   heavily disturbed. This study attempts to model long-term monthly
   rainfall variability in the selected provinces of South Africa using
   various statistical techniques. The study investigates the normality and
   stationarity of the underlying distribution of the whole body of
   rainfall data for each selected province, the long-term trends of the
   rainfall data and the extreme value distributions which model the tails
   of the rainfall distribution data. These approaches were meant to help
   achieve the broader purpose of this study of investigating the long-term
   rainfall trends, stationarity of the rainfall distributions and extreme
   value distributions of monthly rainfall records in the selected
   provinces of South Africa in this era of climate change. The five
   provinces considered in this study are Eastern Cape, Gauteng,
   KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. The findings revealed that the
   long-term rainfall distribution for all the selected provinces does not
   come from a normal distribution. Furthermore, the monthly rainfall data
   distribution for the majority of the provinces is not stationary. The
   paper discusses the modelling of monthly rainfall extremes using the
   non-stationary generalised extreme value distribution (GEVD) which falls
   under the block maxima extreme value theory (EVT) approach. The maximum
   likelihood estimation method was used to obtain the estimates of the
   parameters. The stationary GEVD was found as the best distribution model
   for Eastern Cape, Gauteng, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. Furthermore,
   model fitting supported non-stationary GEVD model for maximum monthly
   rainfall with nonlinear quadratic trend in the location parameter and a
   linear trend in the scale parameter for Limpopo, while in Mpumalanga the
   non-stationary GEVD model with a nonlinear quadratic trend in the scale
   parameter and no variation in the location parameter fitted well to the
   monthly rainfall data. The negative values of the shape parameters for
   Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga suggest that the data follow the Weibull
   distribution class, while the positive values of the shape parameters
   for Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo suggest that the data follow the
   Frechet distribution class. The findings from this paper could give
   information that can assist decision makers establish strategies for
   proper planning of agriculture, infrastructure, drainage system and
   other water resource applications in the South African provinces.},

Title = {Trends and Interannual Variability of Extreme Rainfall Indices over
   Cameroon},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Central African citizens are highly vulnerable to extreme hydroclimatic
   events due to excess precipitation or to dry spells. This study makes
   use of CHIRPS precipitation data gridded at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees
   resolution and extended from 1981 to 2019 to analyze spatial
   variabilities and trends of six extreme precipitation indices defined by
   the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) over
   Cameroon. They are the number of wet days (RR1), the simple daily
   intensity index (SDII), the annual total precipitation from days greater
   than the 95th percentile (R95ptot), the maximum number of consecutive
   wet days (CWD), the maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD), the
   number of very heavy rainfall (RR20). The standard precipitation index
   (SPI) time series were also examined in the five agro-climatic regions
   of the domain. The pattern of annual precipitation was first checked
   over the entire domain. We obtain a well-known pattern showing a
   decreased precipitation northward with the highest values around the
   Atlantic Ocean coast. The analysis shows that all indices represent
   patterns approximately similar to that of annual rainfall except CDD
   where the spatial south-north gradient is reversed. RR20 shows the
   lowest spatial variability. Trend study of RR1 indicates negative values
   south of the domain and predominated positive values in the northern
   part, where CDD, on the contrary, shows a decreased trend. The highest
   trends are observed in the northernmost area for CWD and around the
   coast for SDII and R95ptot. SPI time series indicate an alternative dry
   and wet period and the years between 1990 and 2000 witnessed more annual
   wet conditions. Such a study is very important in this domain where
   variabilities of climatic components are very high due to climate change
   impact and diversified relief. The results can serve as a reference for
   agricultural activity, hydropower management, civil engineering,
   planning of economic activities and can contribute to the understanding
   of the climate system in Cameroon.},

Title = {Heavy Rain-Producing Terrestrial Low Pressure Systems over the East
   Asian Summer Monsoon Region: Evolution, Energetics, and Trend},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {34},
Number = {11},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The synoptic low pressure systems (LPSs) formed over the downwind side
   of the Tibetan Plateau explain a substantial portion of summer rainfall
   extremes along their paths. Recent studies have found that the total
   extreme rainfall trend over the East Asian landmass, which features the
   ``south flood-north drought{''} pattern, can be understood to a great
   extent by the changes in terrestrial LPSs. Yet, the energy sources
   fueling these storms and the environmental drivers of their long-term
   trends remain unclear. Utilizing a probabilistic clustering method,
   three clusters of terrestrial LPS tracks for the period 1979-2018 are
   identified. Besides the differences in trajectories that distinguish the
   clusters into northeastward-migrating and quasi-stationary types,
   prominent intercluster differences are found in the LPS evolution,
   energetics, and trends. The Lorenz energetics suggest that while
   condensational heating is indispensable for all three clusters, the
   migratory type, which has greater intensity and faster development, is
   more closely tied to baroclinicity. Nonetheless, the summer
   baroclinicity alone is not enough to sustain these LPSs as these storms
   dissipate quickly after propagating out of the humid monsoon region and
   into the drier extratropics. Over time, occurrences of migratory LPSs
   decrease, and those of quasi-stationary LPSs increase. Using a Poisson
   model that links the LPS genesis to local environmental conditions, the
   decreasing occurrence of migratory LPSs is shown to result from the
   weakened baroclinicity, whereas the increasing occurrence of
   quasi-stationary LPSs is primarily driven by enhanced relative humidity
   and reduced steering flow in the mid-to-lower troposphere over East
   Asia.},

Abstract = {Spatio-temporal trends of rainfall during the last 119 years (1901 to
   2019) in different meteorological sub-divisions of India were analyzed
   using gridded rainfall data. Innovative trend analysis (ITA) was
   performed for detecting the trends in seasonal and annual rainfall. The
   results of long-term trends and their magnitudes obtained from the ITA
   method were compared with traditional Mann-Kendall (M-K), modified
   Mann-Kendall (mM-K), and linear regression analysis (LRA) methods.
   Significant trends in seasonal and annual rainfall were detected in
   almost all the sub-divisions of India. The monsoon and annual rainfall
   showed increasing trends in most sub-divisions of the peninsular and
   northwest India, whereas decreasing trends were observed in the central
   northeast part of the country. Winter rainfall showed decreasing trends
   in most of the sub-divisions of the country. Results of M-K/mM-K and LRA
   concurred with the trends detected by ITA. However, the ITA is more
   sensitive in detecting hidden trends missed out by the traditional
   M-K/mM-K and LRA tests. This study will provide scientific reference for
   assessment and proactive mitigation of climate change impacts on water
   resources to manage the risk of climate variability.},

Abstract = {Indian monsoon rainfall has a very strong connection with the Indian
   economy. Any variation in trend or pattern of Indian summer monsoon
   rainfall will have serious implications on agronomy, water resources and
   various associated sectors of the economy in India. In this study, an
   in-depth investigation of the monsoon rainfall trend is analyzed for 146
   years period (1871-2016). Three different spatial scales using a
   multimethod approach consisting of the Linear Regression Model (LRM),
   Mann Kendall Test (MKT) and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) are analyzed
   in particular and synchronized way. Monotonic trend with one or the
   other tests are found in Meteorological Sub-division (MetSD) 3, 4, 14,
   11, 10, 19, 20, 27, 8, 29, 28, 23 and 32 (Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur,
   Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,
   Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana , Konkan \& Goa and
   Coastal Karnataka). Whereas, no significant monotonic trend was found
   for India as a unit. Two Homogenous Monsoon Regions (HMR) i.e. Central
   Northeast and Northeast have the monotonic rainfall trend. Moreover, the
   synchronized methodology made it possible to identify the most refined
   significant monotonic trend. It revealed a decreasing monotonic trend in
   MetSD 4, 20 and 27 (Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, East Madhya
   Pradesh and Chhattisgarh) only. ITA based results revealed that MetSD
   14, 8, 19 and 29 (Punjab, Jharkhand, West Madhya Pradesh and Telangana)
   are a new addition to the list of MetSDs with the significant monotonic
   trend. Changepoint in the trend is obtained for Northeast HMR in the
   year 1956 and MetSD 4, 20, 23 and 27 in the year 1969, 1961, 1930 and
   1961 respectively. This study provides insight into the most refined
   trend on monsoon rainfall at different spatial scales in India using the
   updated methods of analysis.},

Title = {Trends in malaria prevalence and risk factors associated with the
   disease in Nkongho-mbeng; a typical rural setting in the equatorial
   rainforest of the South West Region of Cameroon},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Globally, malaria in recent years has witnessed a decline in the number
   of cases and death, though the most recent world malaria report shows a
   slight decrease in the number of cases in 2018 compared to 2017 and,
   increase in 2017 compared to 2016. Africa remains the region with the
   greatest burden of the disease. Cameroon is among the countries with a
   very high burden of malaria, with the coastal and forest regions
   carrying the highest burden of the disease. Nkongho-mbeng is a typical
   rural setting in the equatorial rain forest region of Cameroon, with no
   existing knowledge of the epidemiology of malaria in this locality. This
   study aimed at determining the current status of malaria epidemiology in
   Nkongho-mbeng. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, during which
   blood samples were collected from 500 participants and examined by
   microscopy. Risk factors such as, age, sex, duration of stay in the
   locality, housing type, environmental sanitation and intervention
   strategies including use of, LLINs and drugs were investigated. Trends
   in malaria morbidity were also determined. Of the 500 samples studied,
   60 were positive, giving an overall prevalence of 12.0\% with the
   prevalence of asymptomatic infection (10.8\%), more than quadruple the
   prevalence of symptomatic infections (1.2\%) and, fever burden not due
   to malaria was 1.4\%. The GMPD was 6,869.17 parasites/mu L of blood
   (95\% C.I: 4,977.26/mu L- 9,480.19/mu L). A LLINs coverage of 84.4\% and
   77.88\% usage was observed. Unexpectedly, the prevalence of malaria was
   higher among those sleeping under LLINs (12.56\%) than those not
   sleeping under LLINs (8.97\%), though the difference was not significant
   (p = 0.371). Being a male (p = 0.044), being unemployed (p = 0.025) and,
   living in Mbetta (p = 0.013) or Lekwe (p = 0.022) and the presence
   bushes around homes (p = 0.002) were significant risk factors associated
   with malaria infection. Trends in proportion demonstrated that, the
   prevalence of malaria amongst patients receiving treatment in the health
   center from 2015 to 2019 decreased significantly (p < 0.001) and
   linearly from 9.74\% to 3.08\% respectively. Data generated from this
   study can be exploited for development of a more effective control
   measures to curb the spread of malaria within Nkongho-mbeng.},

Title = {Observed Trends in the South Asian Monsoon Low-Pressure Systems and
   Rainfall Extremes Since the Late 1970s},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {The core Indian monsoon region receives more than half of the rainfall
   extremes from low-pressure systems (LPSs), which typically form over the
   Bay of Bengal and propagate upstream against the time-mean low-level
   westerlies. Yet, the relationship between the trends of LPSs and
   rainfall extremes remains uncertain. Using two tracking algorithms and
   reanalyses-derived LPSs, we find that LPS activity and extreme rainfall
   exhibit coherent trends during the post-1979 satellite era. Over time,
   the LPSs propagate preferentially into south-central India rather than
   north-central India, imparting a corresponding dipole footprint in
   rainfall extremes. Consistent with existing theories that the diabatic
   heating is instrumental in shifting the LPSs west-southwestward, the
   LPSs traveling through south-central India have stronger updrafts on
   their west-southwestern flank than those passing through north-central
   India. The increased frequency of LPSs propagating into south-central
   India is likely due to a strengthened cross-equatorial moisture
   transport, which favors stronger storm ascents.
   Plain Language Summary The South Asian synoptic-scale low-pressure
   systems (LPSs), which typically form over the Bay of Bengal and
   propagate upstream against the time-mean low-level westerlies, produce
   more than half of the summer rainfall extremes over the densely
   populated central India. Given the vulnerability of societies in this
   region to rainfall extremes, investigating the connection between LPSs
   and extreme rainfall regarding their long-term trends has important
   implications for climate adaptation. Using two different tracking
   algorithms and reanalyses-derived LPS tracks, we find that the trends of
   extreme rainfall and LPS activity exhibit a strong coherence during the
   post-1979 satellite era. Specifically, the LPSs prefer to propagate into
   south-central India than north-central India over time, imparting a
   corresponding dipole footprint in rainfall extremes. In agreement with
   previous studies that the LPS propagation is a combined effect of the
   northwestward-propagating component due to horizontal nonlinear
   adiabatic advection and the southwestward-propagating component due to
   diabatic heating, we notice that the LPSs migrating through the
   south-central India have stronger updrafts on their west-southwestern
   flank compared to those passing through north-central India. Our results
   indicate that the increasing number of LPSs propagating into
   south-central India is likely due to a strengthened cross-equatorial
   moisture transport, which provides a wetter environment and favors
   stronger storm ascents.
   Key Points
   An extreme rainfall dipole with positive trends over south-central India
   and negative trends over north-central India is observed since 1979
   The extreme rainfall dipole aligns with the trends in the number of
   Indian monsoon low-pressure systems passing through the two regions
   The changing LPS translation is likely associated with a wetter
   environment owing to a strengthened cross-equatorial moisture transport},

Abstract = {Climate change is a multidimensional phenomenon, which has various
   effects on people's environmental and socioeconomic conditions. In the
   agricultural economy that is susceptible to natural changes, its impact
   is more profound. Therefore, climate change directly affects society in
   different ways, and society must pay a price. Climate change, especially
   the changes in annual temperature and rainfall, has attracted widespread
   attention worldwide. The variability of these factors or the magnitude
   of fluctuations varies according to location. Therefore, in the context
   of climate change, especially in countries dominated by rainfed
   agriculture, studying the trend of meteorological variables is essential
   to assess climate-induced variations and propose feasible adaptation
   approaches. Focusing on this fact is the main goal of this research
   study was to determine the rainfall trend and the accuracy of predicted
   temperature at three particular stations of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Kp)
   Province, Pakistan. For this purpose, rainfall and temperature data were
   provided by Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Islamabad, for the
   period 1960-2020. Two types of nonparametric techniques, Sen's slope
   estimate and the Mann-Kendall test, were applied to determine a trend in
   the average monthly and annual rainfall. The results of the annual
   rainfall trend analysis showed that Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan
   stations showed a positive increasing trend, while the monthly rainfall
   trend showed a negative decreasing trend for all stations. The trend was
   statistically significant for Peshawar and Saidu Sharif stations. The
   accuracy of predicted and actual temperature and rainfall indicated that
   mostly over-forecast occurred at Saidu Sharif and Peshawar. Most of the
   precipitation and temperature records showed under forecast for Dera
   Ismail Khan, but some over-prediction has also occurred.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is a climatic variable that dictates the daily rhythm of urban
   areas in Northeastern Brazil (NEB) and, therefore, understanding its
   dynamics is fundamental. The objectives of the study were (i) to
   validate the CHELSA product with data in situ, (ii) assess the
   spatial-temporality of the rains, and (iii) assess the trends and
   socio-environmental implications in the Metropolitan Region of Maceio
   (MRM). The monthly rainfall data observed between 1960 and 2016 were
   flawed and were filled with the imputation of data. These series were
   subjected to descriptive and exploratory statistics, statistical
   indicators, and the Mann-Kendall (MK) and Pettitt tests. CHELSA product
   was validated for MRM, and all stations obtained satisfactory
   determination coefficients (R-2) and Pearson correlation (r). The
   standard error of the estimate (SEE), root mean square error (RMSE), and
   mean absolute error (MAE) were satisfactory. The highest annual rainfall
   accumulated occurred near the Mundau and Manguaba lagoons. The Pettitt
   test identified that abrupt changes occur in El Nino and La Nina years
   (strong and weak). The monthly rain boxplots showed high variability in
   the rainy season (April-July). Outliers have been associated with
   extreme rainfall at MRM. The drought period was 5 months in all MRM
   seasons, except in Satuba and Pilar. The Mann-Kendall test and the Sen
   method showed a tendency for a significant increase in rainfall in
   Satuba and not significant in the Pilar, while in the others, there was
   a tendency for a decrease in rainfall. The MRM rainfall depends on
   physiographic factors, multiscale meteorological systems, and the
   coastal environment. These results will assist in planning
   conservationist practices, especially in areas of socio-environmental
   vulnerability.},

Abstract = {In this work, the trend of extreme rainfall indices in the
   macrometropolis of Sao Paulo (MMSP) was analyzed and correlated with
   large-scale climatic oscillations. A cluster analysis divided a set of
   rain gauge stations into three homogeneous regions within MMSP,
   according to the annual cycle of rainfall. The entire MMSP presented an
   increase in the total annual rainfall, from 1940 to 2016, of 3 mm yr(-1)
   on average, according to a Mann-Kendall test. However, there is evidence
   that the more urbanized areas have a greater increase in the frequency
   and magnitude of extreme events while coastal and mountainous areas, and
   regions outside large urban areas, have increasing rainfall in a
   better-distributed way throughout the year. The evolution of extreme
   rainfall (95th percentile) is significantly correlated with climatic
   indices. In the center-north part of the MMSP, the combination of
   Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and Antarctic Oscillation (AAO)
   explains 45\% of the P95th increase during the wet season. In turn, in
   southern MMSP, the temperature of South Atlantic (TSA), the AAO, El
   Nino-South Oscillation (ENSO), and the multidecadal oscillation of the
   North Atlantic (AMO) better explain the increase in extreme rainfall
   (R-2 = 0.47). However, the same is not observed during the dry season,
   in which the P95th variation was only negatively correlated with the
   AMO, undergoing a decrease from the 1970s until the beginning of this
   century. The occurrence of rainy anomalous months proved to be more
   frequent and associated with climatic indices than was the occurrence of
   dry months.},

Title = {Trends in Diurnal Cycle of Summertime Rainfall Over Coastal South China
   in the Past 135 Years: Characteristics and Possible Causes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},

Abstract = {The interdecadal changes in the diurnal cycle of summertime rainfall
   over coastal South China (CSC) were analyzed for the period of
   1884-2018. The results revealed that rainfall intensity has increased
   with the decrease of occurrence frequency during both pre- and
   mid-summer in the past 135 years. During the most recent 40 years,
   occurrence frequency and intensity of nocturnal rainfall, especially
   extreme rainfall, have substantially increased over CSC, whereas those
   of daytime extreme rainfall have decreased. Different increasing rates
   of near-surface temperature over land and sea are the main contributors
   to the distinct trends of daytime and nocturnal extreme rainfall. During
   daytime, a higher increasing rate of near-surface temperature over sea
   results in a smaller temperature gradient along the coast, leading to a
   less convective atmosphere. This negates the effect of increased
   air-temperature over CSC in both pre- and mid-summer. In contrast,
   during nighttime, a higher increasing rate of near-surface temperature
   over sea results in a greater temperature gradient along the coast,
   leading to stronger low-level offshore winds and more convective layers
   over coastal waters. During pre-summer, the stronger nocturnal low-level
   offshore winds meets the warm and moist monsoonal flows, substantially
   enhancing nocturnal extreme rainfall along the coast. In mid-summer,
   more vigorous upward motions over coastal waters of CSC enhance
   convective activities during nighttime, which also lead to an
   intensification of nocturnal rainfall. The most significant increase and
   intensification of extreme rainfall is observed in western CSC during
   pre-summer, where the land-sea difference of near-surface temperature is
   the greatest over CSC.
   Key Points
   Diurnal cycle of rainfall over coastal South China during summertime
   from 1884 to 2018 were analyzed
   Different from the 135-year trend, daytime and nocturnal rainfall,
   especially extreme rainfall, exhibits distinct trends during 1979-2018
   Different rates of near-surface temperature over land and sea contribute
   to the distinct trends of daytime and nocturnal extreme rainfall},

Abstract = {This study compares LSTM neural network and wavelet neural network (WNN)
   for spatio-temporal prediction of rainfall and runoff time-series trends
   in scarcely gauged hydrologic basins. Using long-term in situ observed
   data for 30 years (1980-2009) from ten rain gauge stations and three
   discharge measurement stations, the rainfall and runoff trends in the
   Nzoia River basin are predicted through satellite-based meteorological
   data comprising of: precipitation, mean temperature, relative humidity,
   wind speed and solar radiation. The prediction modelling was carried out
   in three sub-basins corresponding to the three discharge stations. LSTM
   and WNN were implemented with the same deep learning topological
   structure consisting of 4 hidden layers, each with 30 neurons. In the
   prediction of the basin runoff with the five meteorological parameters
   using LSTM and WNN, both models performed well with respective R-2
   values of 0.8967 and 0.8820. The MAE and RMSE measures for LSTM and WNN
   predictions ranged between 11-13 m(3)/s for the mean monthly runoff
   prediction. With the satellite-based meteorological data, LSTM predicted
   the mean monthly rainfall within the basin with R-2 = 0.8610 as compared
   to R-2 = 0.7825 using WNN. The MAE for mean monthly rainfall trend
   prediction was between 9 and 11 mm, while the RMSE varied between 15 and
   21 mm. The performance of the models improved with increase in the
   number of input parameters, which corresponded to the size of the
   sub-basin. In terms of the computational time, both models converged at
   the lowest RMSE at nearly the same number of epochs, with WNN taking
   slightly longer to attain the minimum RMSE. The study shows that in
   hydrologic basins with scarce meteorological and hydrological monitoring
   networks, the use satellite-based meteorological data in deep learning
   neural network models are suitable for spatial and temporal analysis of
   rainfall and runoff trends.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal variability of rainfall trends and influencing factors in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {219},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rainfall is the most important meteorological variable that influences
   the economic development of Rwanda. Changes in rainfall trends and
   variability over recent past years have become a great concern to
   policymakers and scientists. This study aims at examining the
   spatiotemporal variability of rainfall over Rwanda and the
   teleconnections of rainfall with different large-scale ocean-atmospheric
   variables at different timescales. The study used rainfall data of
   Climate Hazards Category Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)
   and Climate Research Unit Time Series Version 4 (CRU) for the period
   1981-2017. Several statistical methods, including standardized anomaly,
   Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF), Pearson Correlation, Mann-Kendall
   (MK), and Sen's gradient estimator, were used to assess the variability,
   trends, and teleconnections of rainfall with various driving factors.
   Results revealed a bimodal rainfall pattern in its annual cycle. The
   spatial distribution of annual and seasonal rainfall showed a southwest
   to northwest rainfall gradient. The MK test revealed a decreasing trend
   in annual rainfall in the southwest part of the country. Overall, March
   to May (MAM) rainy seasons showed a decreasing and September to December
   (SOND) rainy season an increasing trend over Rwanda. The EOF analysis
   revealed that the leading mode of variability for MAM rainfall parades a
   unimodal scheme with negative loadings that can explain 59.3\% of the
   total rainfall variance. The dominant mode of variability of SOND
   rainfall revealed the same pattern but with positive loadings that can
   explain 58.1\% of the total variance. Spatial correlation showed that
   the MAM (SOND) rainfall has a weak (strong) relationship with the Indian
   Ocean sea surface temperature (SST), which means a negative (positive)
   Indian Ocean Dipole can lead to anomalously wet (dry) conditions over
   Rwanda. A stronger influence of El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on
   SOND rainfall than MAM rain was noticed. The results of this study are
   crucial in developing appropriate mitigation measures to curb the
   impacts of climate change on the agriculture and water resources of
   Rwanda.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyse the annual maximum (i.e., outlier or extreme)
   rainfall datasets, and also to detect potential trends and assess their
   significance for the Aegean region, Turkey. These datasets were analysed
   using the parametric Student's t-test, the nonparametric Mann-Kendall
   (MK) trend test, the Sen trend test, and a novel proposed approach in
   this present study. Moreover, a homogeneity test was applied to the
   datasets. The analyses were based on 60-year {[}1960-2019, except for
   Usak (1960-2015)] records at the eight meteorological stations. In this
   context, the findings showed that there was no statistically significant
   trend according to the Student's t-test and the MK test except for
   Afyonkarahisar. Sen test provided some different results from the
   Student's t-test and the MK trend test except for Kutahya, Manisa,
   Mugla, and Usak provinces. The novel approach provided some different
   results from the Student's t-test, Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, and the
   Sen trend test. For example, there was a statistically significant
   increasing trend in the Student's t-test, Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test,
   and the Sen trend test for Afyonkarahisar. There was a statistically
   insignificant increasing trend in the newly developed approach at a 90\%
   confidence interval with a two-tailed hypothesis test; therefore, this
   increasing trend especially for Afyonkarahisar should be considered in
   designing of the engineering and other related structures. In addition
   to these consequences, some advantages of the novel approach can be
   explained as follow: this novel approach (i) provides a good option to
   see the limits of the data on the plot because data visualisation is
   very important; (ii) has benefited both visually and mathematically in
   considering the extreme data, and (iii) can also be evaluated as a
   support test for other trend tests, such as MK and Sen.},

Journal = {APPLIED WATER SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Scientists, since a long time, have paid attention on climate change
   and, in particular, rainfall decrease. These changes have resulted in
   modifications of the rainfall regime in many Mediterranean regions. This
   work is based on monthly rainfall data from 17 stations located in the
   Tafna catchment (North West of Algeria). The study aim is to identify
   long-term (1970-2016) spatial and temporal trends in annual, seasonal
   and monthly precipitation, using the innovative trend analysis (ITA)
   method. The approach is used to classify trends into ``low{''},
   ``medium{''}, ``high{''}, which should be taken in consideration in
   future studies on floods ({''}high{''}) and drought ({''}low{''}). The
   monthly rainfall shows a decreasing trend in all studied stations (100\%
   of stations) during February, March, April, and May, the same phenomenon
   observed in the majority of stations for June, July (82\% of stations),
   and December (58\% of stations). Seasonal analysis indicates a downward
   trend in winter and spring. Using annual rainfall, the stations located
   in the north, west and central part of the Tafna show a decrease in
   rainfall (59\% of stations).},

Abstract = {Agriculture in hill and mountain ecosystem is predominantly rainfed with
   common occurrence of moisture stress. Due to erratic rainfall and
   adverse topology in the Indian Himalaya Region (IHR), agricultural
   drought has become a prime concern. It is a natural disaster which
   evolves in time and their impacts generally last a long period of time.
   The present study attempts to characterize annual, seasonal and monthly
   temporal trend and rainfall pattern of 56 years long-term (1964-2019)
   and post-urbanization or recent (1980-2019) period using meteorological
   data of ICAR-VPKAS, Experimental Farm Hawalbagh, Almoraand Headquarter
   office, Almora observatory located in mid-Himalayan region of
   Uttarakhand state of India. Man-Kendall (alpha <= 0.05; alpha <= 0.10)
   test, Sen.'s slope and rainfall anomaly index (RAI) were employed for
   detecting trend, changes in magnitude of rainfall and identifying
   rainfall deficit year, respectively. The statistically significant
   (alpha <= 0.05) decreasing trend was found during post-urbanization
   (1980-2019) with Sen.'s slope for pre-monsoon season (-2.38 mm/year) and
   annual rainfall (-7.26 mm/year) for Hawalbagh, while cold winter season
   shows statistically significant deceasing trend with Sen.'s slope (-2.00
   mm/year) at Headquarter office, Almora. The decreasing trend in monsoon
   season (statistically significant at alpha <= 0.10) was found during
   (1964-2019). However, both the station showed decreasing rainfall trend
   for pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, cold winter season and annual season.
   Results revealed that RAI analysis frequency of drought year was
   increasing in last 10 years. The results of study will help in
   understanding the variation and availability of rainfall in different
   seasons of the year and motivate to adopt effective water management and
   agricultural practices for rainfed hills. This study will also be useful
   for regional, scientific and policy makers for preparing appropriate
   strategies in order to mitigate adverse impact of climate change in
   mid-Himalayan region.},

Abstract = {The study of rainfall trends and spatio-temporal evolution (patterns)
   helps in understanding and planning the utilization of water resources
   for diverse sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and industries,
   and also provides indications of climate change. The present study
   investigates trends and patterns of seasonal, half yearly, and annual
   rainfall over Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) using
   non-parametric Mann Kendall and Getis-Ord-Gi{*} statistics at a district
   level from 1901 to 2015. The annual rainfall trend for the entire VCIC
   region shows a significant positive trend at 90\%, which is driven by a
   significant positive trend in monsoons. The intensity of spatial pattern
   differs across the seasons. However, the annual pattern shows an
   intensifying hot spot (23\% of VCIC), oscillating hot spot (23\%), and
   no pattern (18\%). The positive trend in rainfall during monsoon seasons
   in north-eastern districts and post-monsoon seasons in the southern
   districts of VCIC has influenced the intensifying hot spot patterns.
   These trends and patterns are required for carrying out a climate risk
   assessment for various sectors like urban and industrial areas to plan
   and propose suitable adaptation measures to cope with extreme rainfall
   events.},

Abstract = {Dry spell frequency and wet day occurrence during the summer rainy
   season across southern Africa are examined using daily rainfall for
   1982-2019. Evidence shows two sharp gradients in dry spell frequency,
   extending southeast from southern Angola to the African south coast near
   the westernmost boundary of preferred cloud band occurrences (diagonal
   gradient), and west from the Limpopo River Valley along 22-24 degrees S
   (meridional gradient) (along 14-16 degrees S in early summer) related to
   regional topography. Trend analysis suggests that the diagonal gradient
   has weakened during 1982-2019 along with some other large areas in
   southern Africa whereas this is only true for part of the meridional
   gradient. Contrastingly, wet days and Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index have significantly increased in several important agricultural
   areas in southern Africa. Evidence suggests these changes are related to
   those in the midlevel Botswana High, El Nino Southern Oscillation,
   Southern Annular Mode, and subtropical Indian Ocean dipole.},

Abstract = {It is a known fact that the size, frequency, and spatial variability of
   hydrometeorological variables will irregularly increase under the impact
   of climate change. Among the hydrometeorological variables, rainfall is
   one of the most important. Trend analysis is one of the most effective
   methods of observing the effects of climate change on rainfall.
   Recently, new graphical methods have been proposed as an alternative to
   classical trend analysis methods. Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis
   (IPTA), which evolved from Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA), is currently
   one of the proposed methods and it does not contain any assumptions. The
   aim of this study is to compare IPTA, ITA with the Significance Test and
   Mann-Kendall (MK) methods. To achieve this, the monthly total rainfall
   trends of 15 stations in the Vu Gia-Thu Bon River Basin (VGTBRB) of
   Vietnam have been examined for the period 1979-2016. The analyses show
   that rainfall tends to increase (decrease) in March (June) at nearly all
   stations. IPTA and ITA with the Significance Test are more sensitive
   than MK in determining the trends. While trends were detected in
   approximately 90\% of all months in IPTA and ITA with the Significance
   Test, this rate was only 23\% in the MK test. Although the arithmetic
   mean graphs in the 1-year hydrometeorological cycle are considerably
   regular at almost all stations, their standard deviations are relatively
   irregular. The most critical month for trend transitions between
   consecutive months for all the stations is October, which has an average
   trend slope of -1.35 and a trend slope ranging from -3.98 to -0.21,
   which shows a decreasing trend.},

Abstract = {The world is currently witnessing high rainfall variability at the
   spatiotemporal level. In this paper, data from three representative rain
   gauges in northern Algeria, from 1920 to 2011, at an annual scale, were
   used to assess a relatively new hybrid method, which combines the
   innovative triangular trend analysis (ITTA) with the orthogonal discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT) for partial trend identification. The analysis
   revealed that the period from 1950 to 1975 transported the wettest
   periods, followed by a long-term dry period beginning in 1973. The
   analysis also revealed a rainfall increase during the latter decade. The
   combined method (ITTA-DWT) showed a good efficiency for extreme rainfall
   event detection. In addition, the analysis indicated the inter- to
   multiannual phenomena that explained the short to medium processes that
   dominated the high rainfall variability, masking the partial trend
   components existing in the rainfall time series and making the
   identification of such trends a challenging task. The results indicate
   that the approaches-combining ITTA and selected input combination models
   resulting from the DWT-are auspicious compared to those found using the
   original rainfall observations. This analysis revealed that the ITTA-DWT
   method outperformed the ITTA method for partial trend identification,
   which proved DWT's efficiency as a coupling method.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to assess the long term variability of the rainfall and
   streamflow in Thuchila river, southern Malawi, from 1985 to 2016. Trends
   of monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall and streamflow of Thuchila
   river were analyzed using Mann-Kendall and Pettit tests at a 5\%
   significance level. The annual, wet, and dry season rainfall in the
   catchment revealed a statistically non-significant decreasing trend. The
   monthly rainfall showed statistically non-significant decreasing trends
   except for April, June, and October. The annual and dry season
   streamflow exhibited a non-significant decreasing trend, whereas the wet
   season revealed a non-significant increasing trend. Sen's slope results
   were all in agreement with the Mann-Kendall findings. The Pettit test
   detected different change points for both rainfall and streamflow in the
   catchment. The dominant change points of decreasing trends appeared
   between 2005 and 2007. During this period, the country experienced
   extreme weather events that affected the rainfall pattern. Pearson
   correlation coefficient was also employed to understand the relationship
   between rainfall and streamflow. The correlation analysis of the
   monthly, annual, and seasonal levels showed a linear relationship
   between rainfall and streamflow in the catchment. The results revealed
   that the rainfall influenced the streamflow changes of Thuchila river.
   This vital information about the trends of the streamflow and rainfall
   in Thuchila catchment plays a crucial role in catchment management. (C)

Abstract = {Rain-on-snow (ROS) events can accelerate the surface ablation of sea
   ice, thus greatly influencing the icealbedo feedback. However, the
   variability of ROS events over the Arctic Ocean is poorly understood due
   to limited historical station data in this region. In this study early
   melt season ROS events were investigated based on four widely used
   reanalysis products (ERA-Interim, JRA-55, MERRA, and ERA5) in
   conjunction with available observations at Arctic coastal stations. The
   performance of the reanalysis products in representing the timing of ROS
   events and the phase change of precipitation was assessed. Our results
   show that ERA-Interim better represents the onset date of ROS events in
   spring, and ERA5 better represents the phase change of precipitation
   associated with ROS events. All reanalyses indicate that ROS event
   timing has shifted to earlier dates in recent decades (with maximum
   trends up to 4 to 6 d per decade in some regions in ERA-Interim) and
   that sea ice melt onset in the Pacific sector and most of the Eurasian
   marginal seas is correlated with this shift. There has been a clear
   transition from solid to liquid precipitation, leading to more ROS
   events in spring, although large discrepancies were found be- tween
   different reanalysis products. In ERA5, the shift from solid to liquid
   precipitation phase during the early melt season has directly
   contributed to a reduction in spring snow depth on sea ice by more than
   0:5 cm per decade averaged over the Arctic Ocean since 1980, with the
   largest contribution (about 2:0 cm per decade) in the Kara-Barents seas
   and Canadian Arctic Archipelago.},

Abstract = {Changes in the rainfall amounts in a small island in the North Atlantic
   Ocean-Madeira Island-were analysed based on complete daily rainfall
   series aggregated into 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month rainfall and annual
   maximum rainfalls of 41 rain gauges (1937/1938-2016/2017). The gaps of
   the daily rainfall data were filled in by the multivariate imputation by
   chained equations whose performance was evaluated. The Mann-Kendall test
   coupled with Sen's slope estimator was applied to detect and quantify
   trends. The sequential Mann-Kendall test was used to identify abrupt
   changes in trends. Results show a widespread downward trend in seasonal
   and annual rainfall, with the highest values in Madeira's central
   region. A strong association between the downward rainfall trends and
   the upward trends of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index was found. New
   insights into the understanding of the rainfall patterns in small island
   environments in the North Atlantic were produced.},

Title = {Spatial Variability of Rainfall Trends in Sri Lanka from 1989 to 2019 as
   an Indication of Climate Change},

Abstract = {Analysis of long-term rainfall trends provides a wealth of information
   on effective crop planning and water resource management, and a better
   understanding of climate variability over time. This study reveals the
   spatial variability of rainfall trends in Sri Lanka from 1989 to 2019 as
   an indication of climate change. The exclusivity of the study is the use
   of rainfall data that provide spatial variability instead of the
   traditional location-based approach. Henceforth, daily rainfall data
   available at Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation corrected with
   stations (CHIRPS) data were used for this study. The geographic
   information system (GIS) is used to perform spatial data analysis on
   both vector and raster data. Sen's slope estimator and the Mann-Kendall
   (M-K) test are used to investigate the trends in annual and seasonal
   rainfall throughout all districts and climatic zones of Sri Lanka. The
   most important thing reflected in this study is that there has been a
   significant increase in annual rainfall from 1989 to 2019 in all
   climatic zones (wet, dry, intermediate, and Semi-arid) of Sri Lanka. The
   maximum increase is recorded in the wet zone and the minimum increase is
   in the semi-arid zone. There could be an increased risk of floods in the
   southern and western provinces in the future, whereas areas in the
   eastern and southeastern districts may face severe droughts during the
   northeastern monsoon. It is advisable to introduce effective drought and
   flood management and preparedness measures to reduce the respective
   hazard risk levels.},

Title = {Proportional Trends of Continuous Rainfall in Indian Summer Monsoon},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A comprehensive study on the Indian summer monsoonal rainfall (ISMR) is
   performed in the light of decadal changes in the continuous rainfall
   events and the number of rainy days using 68 years (1951-2018) of
   gridded rain gauge data. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall's test is applied
   on total rainfall amount, the number of rainy days, number of continuous
   rainfall events, and rainfall magnitude to find trends over different
   climatic zones of India for the two periods, 1951-1984 and 1985-2018.
   Our results found a decreasing trend for more than 4-days of continuous
   rainfall events during the recent 34 years (1985-2018) compared to
   1951-1984. The rate of increase/decrease in extreme/continuous rainfall
   events does not follow a similar trend in number of continuous rainfall
   events and magnitude. Moreover, the rainfall is shifted towards a lesser
   number of continuous rainfall days with higher magnitudes during
   1985-2018. During the crop's sow season (i.e., the first 45 days from
   the onset date of Indian monsoon), the total number of rainy days
   decreased by a half day during the last 34 years. Over the Central and
   North East regions of India, the number of rainfall days decreased by
   similar to 0.1 days/yr and similar to 0.3 days/yr, respectively, during
   1985-2018. Overall, the decreasing trends in continuous rainfall days
   may escalate water scarcity and lead to lower soil moisture over
   rain-fed irrigated land. Additionally, an upsurge in heavy rainfall
   episodes will lead to an unexpected floods. On a daily scale, rainfall
   correlates with soil moisture and evaporation up to 0.87 over various
   land cover and land use regions of India. Continuous light-moderate
   rainfall seems to be a controlling factor for replenishing soil moisture
   in upper levels. A change in rainfall characteristics may force the
   monsoon-fed rice cultivation period to adopt changing rainfall patterns.},

Abstract = {The analysis of detailed characteristics of rainfall is of utmost
   importance for understanding water resources, irrigation, and
   agriculture. This study investigated detailed characteristics of
   rainfall of Bangladesh from 1966 to 2019. Rainfall features like the
   precipitation concentration index (PCI) and seasonality index (SI) were
   estimated to characterize spatial patterns of rainfall regimes, and
   innovative trend analysis (ITA) and percent bias (P-BIAS) were used to
   detect the trend, and its reliability was tested by using the
   Mann-Kendall (MK) or modified Mann-Kendall (mMK) test. The magnitude of
   changes was computed by using Sen's slope estimator (Q), and discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT) was employed to find out the dominant
   periodicity of the trend of annual series. SI and PCI revealed that
   rainfall is mainly seasonal and markedly with the long dry season, and
   the distribution of rainfall is irregular for the major portion of
   Bangladesh. The result of ITA and P-BIAS showed a similar trend for all
   the stations and time scales. ITA showed that 23 stations experienced
   significant (alpha = < 0.05) increasing (39.13\%) and decreasing
   (39.13\%) trends in annual rainfall. For the seasonal scale,
   post-monsoon rainfall is dominated by significant increasing trend
   (60.87\%), whereas winter rainfall is dominated by significant
   decreasing trend (65.28\%); besides, both decreasing and increasing
   trends were found in pre-monsoon and monsoon in Bangladesh. The analysis
   of DWT confirmed that 4- to 16-year periodic cycle was the dominant
   component for annual rainfall. The results of detailed analysis of
   rainfall will be helpful for policymakers and scientists to focus on
   regional-scale planning about flood and drought situation of the country
   that will be ultimately helpful for agricultural development and
   environmental planning.},

Volume = {69},

Abstract = {The frequency of extreme rainfall occurrence is expected to increase in
   the future and neglecting these changes will result in the
   underestimation of extreme events. Nonstationary extreme value modelling
   is one of the ways to incorporate changing conditions into analyses.
   Although the definition of nonstationary is still debated, the existence
   of nonstationarity is determined by the presence of significant
   monotonic upward or downward trends and/or shifts in the mean or
   variance. On the other hand, trend tests may not be a sign of
   nonstationarity and a lack of significant trend cannot be accepted as
   time series being stationary. Thus, this study investigated the relation
   between trend and nonstationarity for 5, 10, 15, and 30 min and 1, 3, 6,
   and 24 h annual maximum rainfall series at 13 stations in Central
   Anatolia, Turkey. Trend tests such as Mann-Kendall (MK), Cox-Stuart
   (CS), and Pettitt's (P) tests were applied and nonstationary generalized
   extreme value models were generated. MK test and CS test results showed
   that 33\% and 27\% of 104 time series indicate a significant trend (with
   p < 0.01-p < 0.05-p < 0.1 significance level), respectively. Moreover,
   43\% of time series have outperformed nonstationary (NST) models that
   used time as covariate. Among five different time-variant nonstationary
   models, the model with a location parameter as a linear function of time
   and the model with a location and scale parameter as a linear function
   of time performed better. Considering the rainfall series with a
   significant trend, increasing trend power may increase how well fitted
   nonstationary models are. However, it is not necessary to have a
   significant trend to obtain outperforming nonstationary models. This
   study supported that it is not necessarily time series to have a trend
   to perform better nonstationary models and acceptance of nonstationarity
   solely depending on the presence of trend may be misleading.},

Abstract = {Global warming is a biggest issue around the world. In this research
   paper, the temporal and spatial trend analysis of seasonal and annual
   rainfall on Bhogavo River watersheds in Sabarmati lower basin of Gujarat
   state of India has been analysed using the data of 11 rain gauge
   stations installed in Bhogavo watershed. Linear regression, Mann-Kendall
   Test, Sen's slope test and innovative trend analysis methods are used to
   carry out monthly and annual rainfall trend analysis. In addition to the
   rainfall analysis, a number of rainy days change in magnitude as a
   percentage of mean rainfall have also been analysed using linear
   regression and Sen's slope method, respectively. The IDW method is used
   to develop a spatial distribution of annual and seasonal rainfall trend
   over the study area. From the results, it is concluded that annual
   rainfall shown increasing (positive) trend at nine stations out of 11
   stations. The highest value of change in magnitude of trend as a
   percentage of mean monthly rainfall has been obtained in the month of
   July, attributing increasing trend at Sayla station and lowest value
   magnitude of trend as a percentage of mean rainfall in the monthly
   rainfall has been obtained in the month of August, attributing
   decreasing trend at Bavla station.},

Title = {Land Degradation in Bihar, India: An Assessment Using Rain-Use
   Efficiency and Residual Trend Analysis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Land degradation, a major environmental problem, poses threats to
   agricultural, social and economic stability of many regions of the
   world. In India, similar to 37\% of the total land area is estimated to
   be degraded. Although assessment of land degradation in arid and
   semiarid regions of India has advanced through remote sensing
   time-series analysis such as rain-use efficiency (RUE) and residual
   trend analysis (RESTREND), the sub-humid and other regions mostly remain
   unexplored in this respect. In this study, land degradation in Bihar, a
   sub-humid state, was quantitatively assessed through RUE and RESTREND
   from 1995 to 2011. RUE is the ratio of aboveground net primary
   productivity to precipitation and has been widely used as a measure of
   land degradation. RESTREND, on the other hand, examines the trend of
   NDVI residuals, which is the difference between observed NDVI and
   predicted NDVI from rainfall data. Results indicate that RESTREND
   effectively estimated the extent of human-induced land degradation in
   Bihar as 4.73 M ha. Agro-climatic zone IIIB, the driest zone, has the
   highest percentage of degraded lands (33\%), while Zone IIIA has the
   lowest percent of degraded lands (17\%). Zones I and II each account for
   25\% of the degraded lands, most of which are affected by waterlogging
   and salinity. Although other land degradation databases have also
   indicated a rapid increase in land degradation across Bihar, it needs
   more ground-based data collection to substantiate it. The problem,
   however, may further aggravate with global warming, which calls for
   policy interventions such as adopting agroforestry, practicing
   sustainable agriculture and making shifts in cropping patterns.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal trends of rainfall erosivity and its implication for
   sustainable agriculture in the Wei River Basin of China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {245},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Water and soil are important natural resources for agricultural
   development. Soil erosion is a worldwide problem threatening sustainable
   agriculture development. Rainfall is one of the major natural factors
   that cause soil erosion. The study of the spatial distribution and
   temporal trends of rainfall erosivity is practical and important for the
   assessment of soil erosion hazards, the planning of soil and water
   conservation measures, and the sustainable agriculture development. In
   this study, the data of daily rainfall in the Wei River Basin from 1969
   to 2018 were collected, the spatial and temporal variation
   characteristics of rainfall and rainfall erosivity were analyzed. The
   results show that the regional mean annual rainfall varies from 315.0 to
   807.3 mm, which shows an increasing spatial trend from northwest to
   southeast. The mean annual rainfall erosivity in the basin ranges from
   751.4 to 2600.0 MJ.mm.hm(-2).h(-1), which has a similar pattern of
   spatial distribution as the rainfall. The monthly rainfall erosivity
   changing pattern is a single-peak type. High erosivity of rainfall was
   mainly observed from July to September. The peaks mostly occur in July
   and August. The temporal trend of annual rainfall erosivity ranges from
   -6.6-10.1 MJ.mm.hm(-2).h(-1) per year, the Loess Plateau and the Qinling
   Mountains in the southern basin show an increasing trend, and the
   surroundings of Xifeng, Changwu and Huanxian have the statistical
   significance of P < 0.05. In the midstream and downstream of the basin
   and the Guanzhong Plain, the rainfall erosivity shows an insignificant
   decreasing trend. The North Atlantic Oscillation obviously influences
   the rainfall erosivity in the recent two decades. The study results may
   helpful for the scientific management, soil erosion prevention and
   sustainable agricultural development of the Wei River Basin.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is one of the most studied meteorological variables for both
   excess and lack can lead to several disturbances. The aim of this study
   consisted in analyzing the predominant patterns of temporal distribution
   of daily, monthly, seasonal and annual precipitation in the period 1976
   to 2019 in the municipality of Alto Piquiri-PR. We also sought to verify
   the presence of significant trends in the total annual precipitation
   series and the total number of days with rainfall occurrence by means of
   the non-parametric Mann (1945) and Kendall (1975) test. The results
   obtained pointed out that the average annual rainfall was 1651 mm, while
   the anomalous rainy years were 1982, 1983, 2015 and 2016, and the dry
   one in 1991. The average number of rainy days came to 90 and the spring
   has recorded the highest rainfall heights. Almost all absolute monthly
   highs were recorded in the twelve wettest years of the entire period. No
   trend was detected in the total annual rainfall, but in the number of
   days with rain there was a significant trend, that is, the rains have
   become more concentrated mainly as of the year 1999. Associating this
   trend to climate change would not be correct with just 44 years of data,
   in fact, it is implied that this is a variability which took place in a
   given period.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of a set of large
   ensembles (LE) of Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations from the
   Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive, Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and database for Policy Decision making for
   Future climate change in reproducing the variability and change of the
   austral summer precipitation observed in South America along the second
   part of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st. LE show similar
   biases in the mean austral summer rainfall and interannual variability
   than those detected in previous model sets, such as the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The positive trends in
   south-eastern South America (SESA) and negative ones in the southern
   Andes (SAn), that are the most significant observed regional features,
   are identified to some extent in LE simulations. The negative trend in
   SAn is a feature consistently shown among different models. For all
   models, mean trend is negative in that particular region and larger than
   the inter-member dispersion for each large ensemble. Trend magnitudes in
   the SESA region show a larger dispersion between models than the SAn
   region. While the mean trend among models is consistent with the
   observations, models underestimate the observed trend. The multi-model
   ensemble of selected models that best reproduce both mean and
   interannual variability features of rainfall in South America shows an
   18\% larger positive mean trend in SESA rainfall than those that have
   the worst performance. However, internal variability uncertainty is
   still higher than the mean trend for both sets of multi-model ensembles
   {[}5\% (18\%) for selected (non-selected) models]. Improvements in the
   representation of the main features of mean rainfall and variability are
   needed in order to better describe and reduce the uncertainties
   associated with the main climate change related signals in the
   continent.},

Abstract = {This study examines the observed seasonal and annual rainfall trend and
   variability in Bhutan from 1996-2017. Using standard statistical
   methods, we utilized Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator to
   determine the trends in the seasonal rainfall of Bhutan. We analyzed the
   temporal variability and spatial pattern of rainfall by using the
   principal component analysis (PCA), Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI), and
   Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI). Our results indicate that the
   summer season contributed to the 73\% of the total rainfall in Bhutan
   while winter season contributed only 1\%. Results from the PCI indicate
   that the rainfall distribution in the northeast part of the country is
   moderately concentrated while the south to the northwest portion
   experienced high fluctuation in rainfall distribution. PCA explains the
   90.1\% of the total variance is linked to the variability of Asian
   monsoon. The influences of ENSO/La Nina are possible causes for the
   variability of rainfall in Bhutan though this necessitates more
   investigations to corroborate.},

Abstract = {Detecting trends in streamflow and rainfall series can have great
   significance for proper water resource management. Thus, the objective
   of this study was to analyze the trends of historical streamflow and
   rainfall series using nonparametric statistical tests. A historical
   series of pluviometric and fluviometric gauges, which belong to the
   hydrometeorological network of the Brazilian Water National Agency in
   the Santo Antonio River Basin, Brazil, from 1985 to 2014 were used. By
   applying statistical tests, it was found that the time series are
   independent and random, and from the total 24 rainfall gauges evaluated,
   12 presented nonstationary behavior, exhibiting mostly decreasing
   trends. Based on the six fluviometric gauges used for the annual
   streamflow series, only the annual data of one gauge tended to decrease
   to the minimum streamflow. However, for the monthly series, three gauges
   showed decreasing trends between July and September. This decrease in
   streamflow may be a consequence of rainfall reductions, high water
   demand, and changes in land use and cover.},

Abstract = {The present research aims to assess the historical change in rainfall
   patterns with the changing climate in the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar district
   in the state of Gujarat in India. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test along with
   Sen's slope estimator have been used for detecting the trend of rainfall
   data series. The trend of annual rainfall is carried out for - (1) six
   rain gauge stations established by the State Water Data Center (SWDC)
   and (2) 11 grid data available from the National Center for
   Environmental Prediction-Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR)
   for 35 years starting from 1979 to 2013. Results obtained from these two
   data sets for the trend detection were found consistent. Furthermore,
   the analyses of annual and monthly rainfall using MK test and Sen's
   slope estimator at six rain gauge stations are carried out in three time
   periods i.e. 1974-1987, 1988-2001 and 2002-2016. The inverse distance
   weighted (IDW) method of interpolation is used for the results obtained
   from the spatial distribution of the temporal rainfall trend for
   interpolating the station value over the study area. Annual rainfall for
   data length of 1979 to 2013 shows an increasing trend. The trend of
   annual and monthly rainfall for July and September shows a positive
   trend for the span 2002-2016. This study would be useful to the water
   resource department and policymakers for climate change adaptation in
   the study area.},

Abstract = {The greatest need of the modern world is energy. From production to
   consumption, energy has become essential in all areas. As fossil-derived
   energy production systems cause global warming and climate change,
   interest in renewable energy sources is increasing. Despite the
   pandemic, solar production has shown promising growth throughout the
   world. Turkey has been encouraging investments in renewable energy
   sources, especially solar energy, for the last 10 years. Feasibility
   studies before the installation of solar power plants are crucial for
   investors. As a result of feasibility studies, the cost of the
   investment and the depreciation period can be calculated. In this study,
   feasibility studies of the 474 kWp power plant in Samsun province were
   carried out with PVsyst program. Significant differences were found
   between the software results and the actual results of the solar plant
   built in Samsun province. Production losses between actual data and
   numerical data are thought to be related to meteorological data. There
   are numerous studies in the literature about PV software. However.
   current studies have not examined the effect of meteorological data of
   the region on the difference in production between PV software results
   and solar power plant production values. In this study, the Sen method
   was used to determine the precipitation trend by taking meteorological
   data from Samsun province. With this method, rainfall in Samsun province
   was seen to be on an upward trajectory. For this reason, in regions
   where there is a lot of precipitation; feasibility studies of solar
   power plants are falling by approximately 9 percent.},

Abstract = {The frequency and the severity of extreme events arc increasing. In
   2019, 935 new extreme events were detected in Turkey, with the most
   hazardous being heavy rain, floods, and windstorms. Ankara, the capital
   of Turkey, is one of the affected cities from these events.
   Understanding the characteristics of these events is crucial because
   extreme events have significant negative impact on social, physical. and
   economic environments. In this study,9 extreme-precipitation indices
   were determined and examined in terms of trends and statistical
   characteristics for the historical (1950-2015) and future (2015-2090)
   period at Ankara, Turkey. HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-MR, and. GFDL-ESM2M model
   results under two representative concentration pathways (RCP), RCP45 and
   RCP85 scenarios at two grid cells (2733 and 2734) covering four major
   stations of Ankara were used to obtain future-period precipitation
   series. Moreover, extreme-value analyses were applied to daily
   precipitation data of historical (1950-2015) and projected (2050-2090)
   periods with peak-over-threshold (POT) and block maxima (BM) approaches,
   and the results were compared. Trend-test results, in general, yielded
   insignificant trends that were mostly negative. Results of extreme-value
   analyses show that Grid 2734 return-level values were considerably
   greater than those of Grid 2733. and variability increased with an
   increasing return period. Grid 2734 results also exhibited greater
   values than those of observation-period return levels, while return
   levels at Grid 2733 exhibited smaller values than the observation-period
   return-level values.},

Abstract = {Trend detection in rainfall time series is a prime task to provide
   reliable outcomes for better planning and management of water resources
   under climate change. This study investigated the rainfall trends in
   seasonal and monthly rainfall over Vietnam, using high-resolution
   gridded datasets from 1980 to 2010. Possible trends in rainfall values
   were detected by a recently proposed Innovative- Sen Analysis (ITA)
   method, which allows identifying the trends of the low, medium, and high
   values of a series. The outcomes showed high domination of significantly
   increasing trends in annual rainfall. Moreover, the analysis of partial
   trends in the time series identified a sequence of alternating
   decreasing, increasing, and trendless seasonal and monthly rainfall. On
   the other hand, opposite trends were found for extreme rainfall, in
   which the high values in the rainy season showed negative trends, while
   the positive trends of low values in the dry season were indicated.
   Besides, based on categorization, the low, medium, and high monthly
   rainfall values of the seven sub-regions were mainly evaluated, which
   occurred in different trends. The high values in monthly of the rainy
   season had also detected an upward trend, and the low values in monthly
   dry season existed downward trends that are expected that these results
   will be associate with rainfall trends with floods and droughts.
   Besides, the study showed that the ITA method could be successfully used
   in trends analysis for gridded datasets of rainfall variables.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to identify and measure the impact of climate
   change on rainfall patterns in the Uttar Dinajpur district of West
   Bengal. The hydro-meteorological time series rainfall data was collected
   from the IMD and CHRS data portals and subsequently analysed using
   various statistical methods. Agriculture in this district is the main
   economic activity, but the rainfall propensity is very unpredictable and
   sporadic that has a significant impact on agriculture. The rainfall
   results (1901-2019) were examined and assessed using statistical
   techniques for Mann-Kendall's Z-statistic and Sen's slope estimators.
   From the estimation, it is understood that the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and
   winter seasons have positive trends in rainfall, whereas the
   post-monsoon rainfall shows a negative trend and both Mann-Kendall and
   Sen's slope projections depict the same. Likewise, January, February,
   April, May, June, July, August, and December reflect upward positive
   change, while a downward trend (decline trend) was recorded in March,
   September, and October. The winter Kharif crops are more impacted by
   this negative or decreasing pattern of seasonal rainfall than other
   crops. The maximum average monthly rainfall in July (892.1 mm) and
   January showed the lowest average monthly rainfall of 63.3 mm. The
   results revealed that during the monsoon season the maximum rainfall
   (75.2\%) occurred and the coefficient of variance value is 20.4 \%. In
   the winter season, the minimal rainfall (2.87\%) with a coefficient of
   variance (CV) is 72.9\%. The rainfall forecast using SMOreg and linear
   regression methods has been calculated. This research contributes
   greatly to adopting different strategies by the planners, researchers,
   numerous government institutions, and NGOs for the overall development
   of the study area. This study may also be effective in the management of
   water resources in the study region.},

Abstract = {Jakarta city is one of the capitals that prone to frequent flooding. The
   objective of this study was to reveal climate trends and rainfall
   patterns upstream that were deemed to contribute to the flooding. Based
   on the daily climate data over 35 years from 1985 to 2019 and by
   applying Maim-Kendall Test and Gumbel distribution model, the watershed
   has become hotter and drier as indicated by a significant increase of
   air temperature (between 0.48 degrees C -1.26 degrees C) and decrease of
   the relative humidity (over 2.9\%). While the annual rainfall ranged
   around 3158 +/- 432 mm and did not indicate any changes. There were 5
   extreme rainfalls in 1992 amounted to 4104 mm, 1995 (3758 mm), 2000
   (3593 mm), 2012 (3779 mm), and 2013 (4283 mm). The maximum daily
   rainfall tended to increase at the slope of 0.94 mm/year, but the trend
   was not considered significant. The most probable event (63\%) of the
   maximum daily rainfall was 98 mm with its return period of 1.6 years.
   The largest maximum daily rainfall was 245 mm in 2007 with its return
   period of 187 years causing the heaviest flooding with the highest
   casualty. There were clear indications that the rainfalls upstream
   considerably correlated with flooding.},

Title = {Traffic Status Evolution Trend Prediction Based on Congestion
   Propagation Effects under Rainy Weather},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 19},
Abstract = {In rainy weather, the accurate prediction of traffic status not only
   helps road traffic managers to formulate traffic management methods but
   also helps travelers design travel routes and even adjust travel time.
   In this paper, based on six-dimensional data (e.g., past and present
   spatiotemporal traffic status, road network structure, pavement type,
   water accumulation, and rainfall level), a fuzzy neural network (FNN)
   prediction system is proposed to predict traffic status. The traffic
   status evolution trend is related not only to the existing traffic but
   also to the new traffic demand. Therefore, the FNN prediction system
   designed includes offline and online parts using the data of the past
   and the day separately and avoids the forecast of new traffic demand.
   The fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is applied to cluster traffic
   status data under similar rainy weather in the past to form an offline
   initial dataset, which is used to train FNN weight parameters. The
   online part uses real-time detection data and the parameters trained by
   the offline part to further predict the traffic status and returns the
   prediction errors to the offline part to correct the weight parameters
   to further improve prediction accuracy. Finally, the FNN prediction
   system is verified using real Beijing expressway network data. The
   verification results show that the prediction system can guarantee
   prediction accuracy and can be used to effectively identify traffic
   status.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal rainfall trend and homogeneity analysis in flood prone
   area: case study of Odaw river basin-Ghana},
Journal = {SN APPLIED SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Accurately forecasting rainfall trends is vital for the socio-economic
   development of a nation. Observed daily rainfall data from the Ghana
   Meteorological Agency (GMet) spanning 1980 - 2015 was deployed to study
   the spatio-temporal rainfall trend in the Odaw river basin (ORB) in
   Accra. Using Mann-Kendall (MK), Sen's slope and set of homogeneity
   tests, the monthly, annual and decadal rainfall variability based on the
   indices - rainfall total, daily maximum and rainy/wet day count were
   examined. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and wavelet (WT) analysis
   were applied on the monthly time series in order to verify the
   spatio-temporal variability. It was observed that a mean value ranging
   from 760 to 1200 mm, 77.1-94.4 mm and 56-90 day count were recorded for
   Annual Rainfall Total (ART), Annual Daily Maximum (ADM) and Annual Rainy
   Days (ARD) respectively in the ORB. Mann-Kendal test recorded an overall
   non-significant positive trend in the Odaw basin for ART and ARD with an
   average positive slope of 3.7 mm/year and 0.23 wet days/year and a
   significant positive trend with slope value of 0.55 mm/year for ADM in
   the basin. On the monthly scale, a significant upward trend was observed
   for the dry seasonal months; December, January and February for the
   Monthly Rainfall Total (MRT) and Monthly Daily Maximum (MDM) rainfall
   series during the period at all stations. Homogeneity for both annual
   and monthly rainfall time series were observed over the stations in the
   basin by the Pettitt, Alexandersson's SNHT and Buishand's tests. PCA
   revealed that the spatial variability of rainfall in ORB is very diverse
   with 55.9\% of the variability located in the middle to highland part
   while 44.0\% of the variation is occurring mostly in the low-lying area
   at the southeastern part of the ORB. The wavelet analysis also revealed
   a strong annual periodicity at all the selected stations in the basin.
   The outcome of this study provides valuable information to formulate
   adaptation measures through appropriate strategies for managing flood in
   the study area.},

Abstract = {Understanding rainfall distribution in space and time is crucial for
   sustainable water resource management and agricultural productivity.
   This study investigated the spatial distribution and temporal trends of
   rainfall in Amhara region using time series rainfall data of Climate
   Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) for the
   period 1981-2017. Coefficient of variation, standardized anomaly index
   (SAI), precipitation concentration index (PCI) and seasonality index
   (SI) were used to evaluate rainfall variability and seasonality.
   Mann-Kendall's test was also employed for rainfall trend analysis.
   Results showed that the region has been experiencing variable rainfall
   events that cause droughts and floods over different years. SAI also
   witnessed the presence of inter-annual variability of rainfall with
   negative and positive anomalies in 59.46\% and 40.54\% of the analyzed
   years, respectively. PCI and SI results implied that the area had
   irregular and strong irregular rainfall distribution. Trend analysis
   results showed an overall increase in the annual and seasonal rainfall
   (except winter) during the study period. The information obtained from
   this study could serve as a proxy for rainfall variability and trend in
   the study area which might be used as input for decision-makers to take
   appropriate adaptive measures in various agricultural and water
   resources sectors.},

Abstract = {Characterization of nonlinear trends in time series of hydroclimatic
   variables exhibiting nonstationarity is necessary for more realistic
   projections of climate change and for optimal design of hydraulic
   structures. The present study was conducted to demonstrate the
   applicability of a novel Monte-Carlo-based singular spectrum analysis
   (SSA) to characterize nonlinear trends in historical time series of
   rainfall characteristics. Long-term (1960-2015) rainfall records for 17
   gauges located in the Malaprabha River Basin, India, were used to
   analyze spatiotemporal variabilities of trends in rainfall totals and
   number of rainy days for annual and seasonal time periods. While the
   traditional Sen's Slope and Mann-Kendall (MK) trend tests indicated
   statistically nonsignificant decreasing monotonic trends at most gauge
   stations, SSA revealed the existence of steep nonlinear trends and
   distinct change points in the direction of the trend over the period of
   record for both rainfall and rainy days. Results of this study
   demonstrate the potential for SSA to extract crucial information on the
   trajectories of nonlinear trends and change points in time series of
   hydroclimatic variables that exhibit nonstationarity.},

Title = {A changing Amazon rainforest: Historical trends and future projections
   under post-Paris climate scenarios},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {195},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite the progress in sustainable development strategies, the role of
   the Amazon rainforest as a carbon sink faces increasing disturbances
   that may have a critical impact on global climate. Understanding the
   vulnerability of the Amazon rainforest to climate change is a major
   challenge, considering the complex interaction between human and natural
   systems. This paper aims, via an interdisciplinary approach, to assess
   the observed evolution and possible future of the Amazon rainforest,
   considering different global climate and socioeconomic scenarios. By
   comparing historical with plausible future developments, we present key
   knowledge to inform mitigation and regional adaptation policy
   considerations. As an entry point, historical trends of annual mean
   temperature and precipitation were analysed. In a second step, the same
   assessment was made for the mean annual NDVI sum (a proxy of yearly
   plant productivity), representing vegetation strength. For these
   purposes, a 34-year period (1982-2015) was considered. Trends were
   analysed based on non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods. With
   this representation of the past, the next step focused on future
   scenarios. The most plausible global emission pathways were evaluated
   via the comparison of ten assessments of the possible effects of the
   mitigation action plans of national governments, as stated in the
   National Determined Contributions (NDCs). Results indicate a strong
   consensus that if either current policies, unconditional or conditional
   NDCs are fulfilled, the limit of global warming by ``well below 2
   degrees C{''} will be exceeded. In this context, climate projections for
   the Amazon suggest, among other results, an increase in the range of 1.3
   degrees C (lower limit under SSP1-2.6) to 6.5 degrees C (upper limit
   under SSP5-8.5). Unlike temperature, positive and negative anomalies are
   expected for precipitation depending on location. Despite the
   uncertainty regarding the projections, possible changes such as forest
   diebacks and sav-annization may take place, namely in southeastern
   Amazon, by the end of the century. Overall, this study highlights the
   importance of carefully considering the combination of different
   factors, such as deforestation, to guarantee rainforest resilience under
   climate-driven changes.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A high resolution (0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees) daily gridded dataset was
   analysed to study the spatial and temporal trend in various regions of
   India during the period of 1901-2013. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test has been applied to the time series (1901-2013) rainfall data
   in order to detect the trends for both rainfall depth and number of
   rainy days. Sen slope estimator test was also used to find out the
   magnitude of the trend. In addition, Pettitt-Mann-Whitney (PMW) test was
   employed so as to determine the probable change year. The results of
   trend analysis of rainfall depth showed maximum number of grid points
   having increasing trend in summer months, while the dry months showed
   higher grid points with significant decreasing trend. Jammu and Kashmir,
   in particular, was found to have increasing trend in all months for all
   three levels of significances, i.e., 1\%, 5\%, and 10\%, while NE
   (northeastern) region continuously reported significant decreasing
   trends. The annual trend analysis of the 30-year moving window of
   rainfall depth showed higher number of grid points with significant
   increasing trend during 1901-1950, decreasing trend during 1931-1980,
   and increasing trend again during 1961-2013. The PMW test for the
   rainfall depth and number of rainy days for 1901-2010 showed 1961 and
   1974 as the most probable change point years with about 339 and 284 grid
   points agreeing upon it, respectively. The maximum increasing
   significant trends in rainfall was observed during south-west monsoon
   months. Recent years also reported an increase in rainfall intensity
   leading to probable increase of extreme events like floods and droughts.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the long-term rainfall trends, their temporal
   variability and uncertainty over mainland Portugal, a small country on
   the most western European coast. The study was based on monthly,
   seasonal and annual rainfall series spanning for a period of 106 years,
   between October 1913 and September 2019 (herein after referred to as
   global period), at 532 rain gauges evenly distributed over the country
   (c.a. 6 rain gauges per 1000 km2). To understand the rainfall behavior
   over time, an initial sub-period with 55 years and a final sub-period
   with 51 years were also analyzed along with the global period. The
   trends identification and the assessment of their magnitude were derived
   using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test coupled with the Sen's
   slope estimator method. The results showed that after the initial
   sub-period with prevailing increasing rainfall, the trends were almost
   exclusively decreasing. They were also so pronounced that they
   counterbalanced the initial rainfall increase and resulted in equally
   decreasing trends for the global period. The study also shows that
   approximately from the late 1960s on, the rainy season pattern has
   changed, with the last months prior to the dry season showing a
   sustained decrease of their relative contributions to the annual
   rainfalls. Overall, the results support the hypothesis of less
   uncertainty on the pronounced decrease of rainfall over mainland
   Portugal in recent years, which is expected to continue. They also show
   that the asymmetry between a less wet North, yet still wet, and an arid
   South is becoming much more marked.},

Abstract = {The effects of climate change on landslide activity may have important
   environmental, socio-economic, and political consequences. In the last
   decades, several short-term extreme rainfall events affected
   Mediterranean regions, resulted in damaging geo-hydrological processes
   and casualties. It is unequivocal that the impact of landslides in
   several Mediterranean countries is increasing with time, but until now,
   there has been little or no quantitative data to support these
   increases. In this paper, both rainfall conditions for the occurrence of
   shallow landslides and rainfall trends were investigated in the
   Portofino promontory, which extends in the Ligurian Sea, where heavy
   rainfall and related ground effects often occur. Adopting a frequentist
   approach, the empirical intensity-duration threshold was estimated. Our
   findings highlight that the rainfall intensity required to trigger
   landslides is lower for the same duration than those expected in other
   similar environments, suggesting a high susceptibility to
   rainfall-induced landslides in the Portofino territory. Further, the
   Mann-Kendall test and Hurst exponent were used for detecting potential
   trends. Analysis of long-term rainfall time series showed statistically
   significant increasing trends in short duration precipitation occurrence
   and rainfall rates, suggesting a possible future scenario with a more
   frequent exceedance of the threshold triggering value and an increase of
   landslide risk.},

Abstract = {The analysis of long-term rainfall data in a changing climate is
   important because it has many sectoral applications such as agriculture,
   infrastructure, and water resources management. Statistical analyses of
   the annual maximum rainfall data were performed using the Mann-Kendall
   (MK) trend test to evaluate the annual maximum trend characteristics of
   the rainfall time series, the innovative trend analysis (ITA) method to
   detect categorial trends, and the ITA indicator to digitize the ITA
   results. Storm durations of 5, 10, 15, 30 min and 1, 3, 6, 24 h annual
   maximum rainfall series at 13 central stations in Central Anatolia,
   Turkey were used. According to the MK test results, there were no
   significant upward or downward monotonic trend at four stations, whereas
   the remaining nine stations showed a significant upward or downward
   monotonic trend. Significant negative and positive trends were
   identified for the sub-hourly and hourly rainfall, whereas significant
   positive trends were detected for hourly storm durations. Significant
   trend results were mostly consistent with the general ITA results. The
   sub-hourly storm duration data were more consistent in terms of
   significant trends. Conversely, when evaluated according to low, medium,
   and high data values in the rainfall series (categories), the high data
   values showed different trends. Although no trend was detected with the
   MK test, the ITA results showed an upward or downward trend for 25
   rainfall series. 29 of 30 significant MK test results were consistent
   with the ITA indicator results, compared with 24 of 30 results of the
   visually inspected ITA results.},

Abstract = {This study examined the spatio-temporal trends and variability of
   seasonal and annual rainfall for 36 districts of Maharashtra, India. For
   this purpose, 118 years (1901 to 2018) gridded rainfall data of India
   Meteorological Department (IMD) were analyzed using Mann-Kendall (MK),
   modified Mann-Kendall (MMK), Sen's slope (SS), Spearman's rank
   correlation (SRC), simple linear regression (SLR), and innovative trend
   analysis (ITA). Auto-correlation coefficient was calculated at lag-1 and
   tested at 5\% level of significance. Rainfall variability was examined
   using the coefficient of variation (CV). The analysis revealed
   significantly decreasing trends for winter and pre-monsoon rainfall in
   districts of Maharashtra. Monsoon, post-monsoon, and annual rainfall had
   both increasing and decreasing trends. Out of 185 time series analyzed,
   ITA detected trends in 168 (90.8\%) time series. All the trends detected
   by MK/MMK, SRC, and SLR were captured by ITA, along with trends in
   additional 103 (55.6\%) time series which were not captured by any of
   the aforesaid methods. Rainfall variability was very high in all the
   districts for winter, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons. The trends
   and variability analysis of rainfall in the state along with their maps
   would be useful for the local stakeholders for planning efficient use of
   water resources.},

Abstract = {The present study is designed to analyse the annual rainfall variability
   and trend in 30 meteorological stations of the Asir region for the
   period of 1970-2017 using the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Modified
   Mann-Kendall (MMK) test, trend free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall (TFPW MK)
   test, and the innovative trend analysis (ITA). A comparative study among
   the trend detection techniques was performed using the correlation
   coefficient. The future rainfall trend based on the historical rainfall
   pattern was investigated by using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).
   Results of the MK test showed that 20 stations in the study area
   observed a negative trend, and out of these, nine stations had
   significant negative trends at the significance level of 0.01. The
   findings of the MMK test showed that 23 stations recorded negative
   trends, and out of these, 18 stations had significant negative trends at
   the significance level of 0.01. Based on the findings of the TFPW-MK
   test, 21 stations observed a negative trend, and among these, 10
   stations had significant negative trends at the significance of 0.01.
   ITA detected 25 stations observing a negative trend, and out of these,
   18 stations had significant negative trends at the significance level of
   0.01. Based on the findings of the tests and their performance, the MMK
   test appeared as the best performing technique among the MK test family,
   while ITA appeared as the best trend detection technique among the four
   techniques because it outperformed (p < 0.01) the others. Results of DFA
   showed that 23 stations (10 were significant) had recorded declining
   future rainfall trends based on past trends. The results of the present
   study would help the planners and policy makers to make accurate and
   easy decisions on irrigation, climatic, and water resource management in
   the Asir region of Saudi Arabia.},

Abstract = {Understanding the timing and variability of rainfall is crucial for the
   effective management of water resources in river basins dominated by
   rainfed agricultural practices. Our study aimed to characterize rainfall
   and analyze the trends in the length of wet spells (LWS) in the Upper
   Awash River Basin-one of the most water-stressed river basins in
   Ethiopia. We applied statistical descriptors and a Mann-Kendall (MK)
   test to determine the onset, end, and LWS for the small (Belg) and main
   (Kiremt) rainy seasons across different landscapes of the basin. We
   observed highly stable rainfall onsets in all stations during both
   seasons. However, unlike the Kiremt season, the LWS in the Belg season
   was too short and unreliable for rainfed agriculture. Based on the MK
   test, an increasing monotonic trend in LWS during the Kiremt season was
   detected only in the mountainous landscape of the basin. In contrast, we
   observed no trends in the remaining stations in the Upper Valley region
   of the basin, despite the linear regressions inferring an upward or
   downward pattern. Our findings provide accurate climatological
   information for the effective development of rainwater management
   strategies in the Upper Awash River Basin.},

Title = {Reconstruction of past rainfall erosivity and trend detection based on
   the REDES database and reanalysis rainfall},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {590},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rainfall erosivity is the driving force of soil erosion and it is
   characterized by a large variability in space and time. In order to
   obtain robust estimates of rainfall erosivity, long series of
   high-frequency rainfall data are needed, which are often not available
   for large study areas. In this study we reconstructed past rainfall
   erosivity in Europe for the period 1961-2018, with the aim to
   investigate temporal changes in rainfall erosivity. As input data, we
   used the Rainfall Erosivity Database at European Scale (REDES) and
   Uncertainties in Ensembles of Regional Reanalyses (UERRA) rainfall data.
   Using a set of regression models, which we derived with the application
   of the k-fold cross-validation approach, we computed the annual rainfall
   erosivity for the 1675 stations forming the REDES database. Based on the
   reconstructed data, we derived a rainfall erosivity trend map for Europe
   where the results were qualitatively validated. Among the stations
   showing a statistically significant trend, we observed a tendency
   towards more positive (15\%) than negative trends (7\%). In addition, we
   also observed an increasing tendency of the frequency of years with
   maximum erosivity values. Geographically, large parts of regions such as
   Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Baltic countries, Great Britain and
   Ireland, part of the Balkan Peninsula, most of Italy, Benelux countries,
   northern part of Germany, part of France, among others, are
   characterized by a positive trend in rainfall erosivity. By contrast,
   negative trends in annual rainfall erosivity could be observed for most
   of the Iberian Peninsula, part of France, most of the Alpine area,
   Southern Germany, and part of the Balkan Peninsula, among others. The
   new dataset of rainfall erosivity trends reported in this study
   scientifically provides new information to better understand the impacts
   of the ongoing erosivity trends on soil erosion across Europe, while,
   from a policy perspective, the gained findings provide new knowledge to
   support the development of soil erosion indicators aiming at promoting
   mitigation measures at regional and pan-European level.},

Abstract = {Rainfall and its impact on the water content of a slope are known to be
   important controls on landslide activity in the UK. This paper presents
   an analysis of long-term monthly rainfall and temperature records from
   selected stations throughout the UK, including the application of a
   non-parametric statistical test to evaluate the significance of any
   trends in these time series. The results indicate that there is
   significant spatial variation in the long-term trends. A positive trend
   of increasing effective rainfall (precipitation minus
   evapotranspiration) is present at some (but not all) Scottish stations
   (Eskdalemuir, Lerwick, Paisley, Stornoway and Tiree), but is not present
   across the rest of the UK.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Very limited studies have evaluated the impact of rainfall on the fate
   of endocrine-disrupting micmpollutants in lacustrine systems. This
   yearlong study investigated monthly fluctuation of bisphenol A (BPA) and
   4-nonylphenol (NP) concentrations in both water and sediment samples
   from Taihu Lake and evaluated the impact of rainfall on their
   spatiotemporal distribution and partition trends. Results showed that
   BPA concentration in water was negatively correlated to rainfall while
   NP concentrations in both phases were positively related to rainfall.
   The spatial distribution of NP in the lake water was season specific
   with the lakeshore area higher than the central area during the wet
   season and a reversed pattern during the dry season. The spatial
   distributions of sediment-associated NP and BPA in both phases were not
   significantly different among seasons. Contrary partition tendencies
   were observed for BPA and NP that BPA tended to desorb from sediment and
   NP tended to be adsorbed during the wet season while the trends were
   reversed during the dry season. This study suggests that rainfall could
   affect the occurrence, distribution and environmental fate of
   micropollutants and should be considered in the monitoring program and
   risk assessment.},

Abstract = {Clearance of terrestrial wetland vegetation and rainfall variations
   affect biodiversity. The rainfall trend-NDVI (Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index) relationship was examined to assess the extent to
   which rainfall affects vegetation productivity within Nylsvley, Ramsar
   site in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Daily rainfall data measured
   from eight rainfall stations between 1950 and 2016 were used to generate
   seasonal and annual rainfall data. Mann-Kendall and quantile regression
   were applied to assess trends in rainfall data. NDVI was derived from
   satellite images from between 1984 and 2003 using Zonal statistics and
   correlated with rainfall of the same period to assess vegetation
   dynamics. Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator showed only one station
   had a significant increasing rainfall trend annually and seasonally at p
   < 0.05, whereas all the other stations showed insignificant trends in
   both rainfall seasons. Quantile regression showed 50\% and 62.5\% of the
   stations had increasing annual and seasonal rainfall, respectively. Of
   the stations, 37.5\% were statistically significant at p < 0.05,
   indicating increasing and decreasing rainfall trends. These rainfall
   trends show that the rainfall of Nylsvley decreased between 1995 and
   2003. The R-2 between rainfall and NDVI of Nylsvley is 55\% indicating
   the influence of rainfall variability on vegetation productivity. The
   results underscore the impact of decadal rainfall patterns on wetland
   ecosystem change.},

Abstract = {Climate change is most likely to cause changes to the temporal and
   spatial variability of rainfall. A trend analysis to investigate the
   rainfall pattern can detect changes over temporal and spatial scales for
   a rainfall series. In this study, trend analysis using the Mann-Kendall
   test and Sen's slope estimator was conducted in the Kelantan River
   Basin, Malaysia. The Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test was
   applied to evaluate the stationarity of the rainfall series. This basin
   annually faces onslaughts of varying year-end flooding conditions. The
   trend analysis was applied for monthly, seasonal and yearly rainfall
   series between 1989 and 2018. The temporal analysis results showed that
   both increasing and decreasing trends were detected for all rainfall
   series. The spatial analysis results indicated that the northern region
   of the Kelantan River Basin showed an increasing trend, whilst the
   southwest region showed a decreasing trend. It was found that almost all
   the rainfall series were stationary except at two rainfall stations
   during the Inter Monsoon 1, Inter Monsoon 2 and yearly rainfall series.
   Results obtained from this study can be used as reference for water
   resources planning and climate change assessment.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the rainfall trend of the West Coast Plain and Hill
   Agro-Climatic Region is analyzed for 117 years (1901-2017). This region
   is a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot and known for one of the
   highest rainfall receiving regions in India. Rainfall grid dataset is
   used for the analysis of rainfall trends on monthly, seasonal, and
   decadal time scales. Modified Mann-Kendall's test, Linear Regression,
   Innovative Trend Analysis, Sen's Slope test, Weibull's Recurrence
   Interval, Pearson's Coefficient of Skewness, Consecutive Disparity
   Index, Kurtosis, and some other important statistical techniques are
   employed for trend analysis. Results indicate that the rainfall trend is
   significant in January, July, August, September as well as the Winter
   season. Among all the significant trends, January and July showed a
   decreasing rainfall trend. July has the highest contribution (30\%)
   among all the obtained monotonic trend to annual rainfall and
   coincidentally has the highest trend magnitude. August and September
   months with a combined contribution of 30\% to annual rainfall, show an
   increasing monotonic trend with high magnitude whereas Winter season
   shows a monotonic decreasing rainfall trend with comparatively low
   magnitudes. Decadal analysis along with the study of recurrence interval
   of excess and deficit years helps to understand the decadal rhythm of
   trend and the magnitude of extreme monthly and seasonal events. Skewness
   reveals that rainfall dataset of all the periodic results is
   right-skewed and the recurrence interval also supports the skewness
   results. Sharply decreasing rainfall in July and rising rainfall in
   August and September is predictive of the impact on agriculture,
   biodiversity and indicates the rainfall regime shift in the region.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is an vital hydro-climatic element at the helm of that heads
   the hydrological cycle and water availability in a specific region. In
   current years, significant deviances have been observed in rainfall
   patterns on a global as well as local scale. Several analyses have
   established that any study of hydro-climatic variables must be handled
   and executed on different micro-scales rather than regional scale
   because the trends and their effects may differ widely from station to
   station. In the current investigative study, the urban rainfall
   variation in the Koraiyar basin between the years 1975-2010 is examined
   to study the trend of precipitation. The non-parametric test is used in
   this study because the data outliers can be avoided easily. The
   Mann-Kendall (M -K) method is adopted to analyze the trend, and Sen's
   slope is used to estimate the linear trend. To detect the change in
   trends, the CUSUM test is applied. The coefficient of variance (CV) is
   applied for variability analysis. From the analysis, it is noted that
   there is an unpredictable increasing and decreasing trend in the yearly
   and periodic rainfall patterns in the basin.},

Title = {Determining rainwater chemistry to reveal alkaline rain trend in
   Southwest China: Evidence from a frequent-rainy karst area with
   extensive agricultural production},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {266},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rainwater chemistry plays an important role in the earth-surficial
   ecosystem, but studies on rainwater chemical composition of karst
   agro-ecosystem are rare. To explore the rainwater alkalization and the
   provenance of components responsible for neutralization, two-years
   chemical monitoring of rainwater was carried out in a karst agricultural
   catchment in Southwest China. The main findings suggest that SO42-,
   NO3-, Ca2+, and NH(4)( )(+)are the principal ions. All the ionic
   contents show distinctly seasonal variation (highest in winter) in
   response to variations in seasonal precipitation because the rain-scour
   process can efficiently remove atmospheric materials. Source
   identification indicates that Cl- and Na+ are mainly derived from marine
   input whereas SO42+ and NO3- are controlled by anthropogenic emission,
   in particular, fixed emission sources. The source of NH4+ is attributed
   to intense agricultural production, while Ca2+ and Mg2+ are mainly
   derived from calcite dissolution. The rainwater alkalization caused by
   the seasonal acid neutralization (via basic components, Ca2+ and NH4+)
   is beneficial to crop growth but also reflect agricultural
   overfertilization. Sulfur controlled the total wet acid deposition
   (68\%-94\%) and could be a potential agent of weathering. (C) 2020

Abstract = {In a changing climate, drought and flood hazards become more frequent,
   posing high risks to human life and property. The Guangxi Zhuang
   Autonomous Region is selected as the study area. The flood and drought
   records, and the daily precipitation data at 23 stations from 1958 to
   2016 are adopted. The temporal and spatial trends of precipitation
   intensities, precipitation days and the corresponding proportions
   relative to the total amounts are examined using the Mann-Kendall trend
   test. The influence of the rainfall intensity on floods and droughts in
   Guangxi is also investigated. During the past 59 years in Guangxi, there
   is a significant decrease in light rain, and an increase in rainstorm in
   general. The larger the rainfall intensity is, the more stations show
   increasing trends of the corresponding rain events on different time
   scales (the monthly, seasonal or annual scale). Significant decreasing
   trends of the number of days with light precipitation are found over
   entire Guangxi, while increasing trends of the number of days with
   rainstorm events are widely distributed in most parts of Guangxi. There
   is a decrease in the number of stations indicating increases in
   proportion of light precipitation days, while an increase in the number
   of stations showing increases in proportion of rainstorm days. A
   significant increase in flood hazards is detected since the 1990s. The
   precipitation in Guangxi tends to be intensified in the future. The
   frequency and intensity of drought and flood events are very likely to
   increase, posing challenges to future agricultural production, water
   resources planning and management.},

Abstract = {The southern coastal belt of West Africa (SCWA) with its high population
   density and many major cities, combined to the low elevation and poor
   urban planning, is very vulnerable to floods resulting from extreme
   rainfall events. The aim of this paper is to analyze the characteristics
   of extreme rainfall in the SCWA during the 1981-2015 period, in terms of
   frequency, intensity, seasonality, and trends. Therefore, daily rainfall
   of 31 stations located in the southern part of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana,
   Togo, and Benin and rainfall estimation products combining in situ
   observations and satellites rainfall estimation data have been used. For
   each station and pixel, the local 95th percentile (P95) computed on all
   rain days of at least 1 mm was used to define extreme rainfall events.
   Rainfall on the coastal belt is heavier than further inland, with P95
   values reaching 82 and 52 mm/day for coastal and continental stations,
   respectively. Extreme rainfall along the coast occurs predominantly
   between May and July. Interannual variations of different indicators of
   extreme rainfall show a broad agreement between rain gauge data and
   rainfall estimates from CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
   Precipitation with Station) data. In the southern part of Cote d'Ivoire
   and Togo/Benin, increase of number of extreme rainfall event (NP95) and
   stability number of days with rainfall less than P95 (NL95) are
   recorded, which induces an increase of total rainfall. But, in the
   southern part of Ghana, there is a stable total rainfall due to an
   increase in NP95 compensated by a decrease in NL95.},

Title = {Comparison of Statistical, Graphical, and Wavelet Transform Analyses for
   Rainfall Trends and Patterns in Badulu Oya Catchment, Sri Lanka},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Climate change has adversely influenced many activities. It has
   increased the intensified precipitation events in some places and
   decreased the precipitation in some other places. In addition, some
   research studies revealed that the climate change has moved seasons in
   the temporal scale. Therefore, the changes can be seen in both spatial
   and temporal scales. Thus, analyzing climate change in the localized
   environments is highly essential. Rainfall trend analysis in a localized
   catchment can improve many aspects of water resource management not only
   to the catchment itself but also to some of the related other
   catchments. This research is carried to identify the rainfall trends in
   Badulu Oya catchment, Sri Lanka. The catchment is important as it is in
   the intermediate climate zone and rich in agricultural productions. Four
   rain gauges (namely, Badulla, Kandekatiya, Lower Spring Valley, and
   Ledgerwatte Estate) were used to analyze the rainfalls in the
   resolutions of monthly, seasonally, and annually. 30-year monthly
   cumulative rainfall data for the above four gauging stations are
   analyzed using various standard tests. Nonparametric tests including
   Mann-Kendall test and sequential Mann-Kendall test and innovative trend
   analysis methods are used to identify the potential rainfall trends in
   Badulu Oya catchment. In addition, continuous wavelet transforms and
   discrete wavelet transforms tests are carried out to check the patterns
   on rainfall to the catchment. The trend analysis methods are compared
   against each other to identify the better technique. The results reveal
   that the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test is powerful to produce the
   statistically significant rainfall trends in qualitative and
   quantitative manner. Mann-Kendall analysis shows a positive trend to
   Ledgerwatte Estate in monthly (3.7 mm in February and 7.4 mm in
   October), seasonal (6.9 mm in the 2(nd)intermonsoon), and annual (3 mm
   annually) scales. However, the analysis records one decreasing rainfall
   trend to Kandekatiya (8.1 mm in December) only in monthly scale.
   Nevertheless, it was found that the graphical method can be easily used
   in qualitative analysis, while discrete wavelet transformations are
   efficient in identifying the rainfall patterns effectively.},

Abstract = {Change point detection and trend analysis are the adopted techniques of
   time series analysis. We have applied non-parametric methods on the
   temporal and spatial-scale data of 115 years between 1901 and 2015 from
   ten different federal states in the north and the northwestern India to
   examine the change points as well as to estimate the future scenarios by
   examining the past trends. The change points were examined by Pettitt's
   test, Standard Normal Homogeneity (SNH) test, and Buishand's test,
   whereas the trend analyses of monthly, annual, and seasonal rainfall
   data were carried out using Sen's slope estimator after assessing their
   statistical significance by Mann-Kendall (M-K) test. The trend analyses
   showed non-zero slope values and a few among them were of statistical
   significance. The results of our statistical experiment concluded that
   the trends of reduction in winter, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon
   rainfalls would have notable effects on the rain-fed agricultural
   production in the near future, particularly in the areas without proper
   irrigation facility (e.g., parts of Uttar Pradesh). More extreme events
   of higher rainfall in some states (e.g., Goa, Maharashtra, and Jammu and
   Kashmir), however might cause disasters like landslide and flooding.},

Abstract = {The impact of climate change is often demonstrated by rainfall and its
   attributes. Consequently, this study analyzes rainfall concentration,
   temporal trends, and rates of change in the savannah zones of Nigeria.
   Rainfall data were acquired from the archives of the Environmental
   Management Programme, Federal University of Technology, Minna, for 13
   synoptic stations at annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales for the
   1970-2016 period. The precipitation concentration index (PCI),
   Mann-Kendall trend test, Theil-Sen's slope estimator (beta), and
   relative percentage change methods were adopted for data analysis. The
   findings reveal that PCI calculated on an annual scale falls into three
   categories 11-15, 16-20, and PCI > 20. Two distinct patterns emerged
   from the calculated PCI indicating that stations in the Guinea savannah
   zone (Bida, Yola, Minna, Jos, Bauchi, and Kaduna) have moderate,
   irregular, and strongly irregular rainfall concentrations, whereas
   stations in the Sudano-Sahelian savannah zone (Kano, Gusau, Maiduguri,
   Yelwa, Nguru, Sokoto, and Katsina) have irregular and strongly irregular
   rainfall concentrations. The Mann-Kendall analysis of the PCI values
   reveals that 8 of the 13 stations (62\%) experienced downward trends.
   This implies that rainfall is sliding toward a moderate to uniform
   distribution. The trends, and consequently the variability in the annual
   and seasonal rainfall, reveal that, with the exception of Yola and Jos
   stations, where the trends were downward, the overall rainfall was
   increasing significantly in some areas and insignificantly in others.
   The magnitude of the signi?cant upward trends in the annual rainfall was
   found to be 3.59 mm yr(-1) at Yelwa station, 9.84 mm yr(-1) at Bauchi
   station, 17.13 mm yr(-1) at Kano station, 3.98 mm yr(-1) at Sokoto
   station, and 3.11 mm yr(-1) at Katsina station. It is understood that
   the changes in rainfall distribution and trends have positive effects on
   water availability for crops, and this should facilitate enhanced
   productivity in rain-fed farming.},

Abstract = {This study examined the long-term (1951-2015) spatio-temporal trends,
   variability, and teleconnections of rainfall of 15 districts in the
   Terai region of Uttar Pradesh, India. Gridded rainfall data of the India
   Meteorological Department (IMD) were analyzed using both parametric and
   non-parametric approaches, and teleconnections of seasonal and annual
   rainfall with Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino/Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) were investigated. Lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient was
   calculated and tested at 5\% level of significance. Our analysis
   revealed significantly declining trends in monthly rainfall for most of
   the districts in all the months, except February, April, May, and
   December which had increasing trends. Monthly rainfall values of the
   region as a whole had significantly decreasing trends in January, July,
   August, and October, while February and April had significantly
   increasing trends. In seasonal and annual rainfall data, only decreasing
   trends were significant. Monsoon, post-monsoon, and annual rainfall were
   decreasing in 6, 9, and 7 districts, respectively. The study area as a
   whole had a significant decrease in monsoon, post-monsoon, and annual
   rainfall with significantly negative Sen's slope (- 2.7, - 0.39, and -
   3.75), Spearman's rho (- 0.25, - 0.21, and - 0.30), and slope of simple
   linear regression (- 2.67, - 0.98, and - 3.49). CV for annual rainfall
   of the whole region was 19\% with maximum variability recorded in
   post-monsoon rainfall (CV = 99.81\%). Our results also revealed that the
   monsoon, post-monsoon, and annual rainfall of the whole region had
   significant teleconnections with both IOD and ENSO events. The results
   herein suggests decreasing rainfall trends in the Terai region of India
   with monsoon and annual rainfall having higher ENSO teleconnections
   while the post-monsoon rainfall teleconnection, dominated by IOD.},

Volume = {56},

Abstract = {The impacts of internal variability on East Asia-Northwest Pacific
   (EA-NWP) summer rainfall trends on the multidecadal time scale are
   invested based on three large ensemble simulations, which have ensemble
   member of 30, 40 and 100. In all the three simulations, the summer
   rainfall trends during 1970-2005 are remarkably diverse across the
   individual ensemble members over the EA-NWP, and the signal-to-noise
   ratio is lower than 1 over the EA-NWP, suggesting a strong impact of
   internal variability on EA-NWP summer rainfall trends at this interval.
   Moreover, we found that the diversity of EA-NWP summer rainfall trends
   across individual members has a similar leading spatial pattern in all
   the three ensembles, featuring reverse trends between in Mei-yu region
   and in the tropical NWP. The leading pattern is likely caused by a
   gradient between the sea surface temperature (SST) trends in the North
   Indian Ocean (NIO) and in the tropical western Pacific (WP). When there
   is a warming trend in the NIO and a cooling trend in the tropical WP, a
   low-level anomalous anticyclone strengthens over the subtropical NWP,
   causing a dipole rainfall trend over the EA-NWP. The impact of the
   east-west SST gradient pattern is confirmed by numerical experiments.
   Our findings highlight that the internally-generated gradient of NIO-WP
   SST trends is an important source of the uncertainty in EA-NWP summer
   rainfall decadal changes in simulations.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study is to understand trend or non-linearity along with
   a chaotic behaviour, if any, of Eastern and North Eastern sub-divisional
   rainfall, namely Orissa, Gangetic West Bengal, Sub Himalayan West
   Bengal, Assam and Meghalaya and also Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and
   Tripura based on rainfall data of 143 years (1871-2013). The analysis is
   performed for examining behaviour of rainfall in each of the seasons,
   namely, Pre monsoon, South West monsoon, North East monsoon and also
   Annual rainfall extracted from the monthly data. For that purpose, a
   trend analysis with Hurst Exponent and non-linearity analysis with
   Lyapunov Exponent are employed. The analysis revealed that rainfall of
   Orissa is persistent for all the seasons whilst the rainfall is
   persistent in Gangetic West Bengal in Pre monsoon and North East monsoon
   and Assam and Meghalaya along with Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and
   Tripura exhibit persistent behaviour in South West Monsoon and annually.
   Sub Himalayan West Bengal exhibit persistence in annual rainfall only.
   Chaotic tendency in low magnitude is located in many cases whilst
   non-chaotic situation has occurred when the persistence is found, mainly
   in pre-monsoon season. Moreover, the analysis of Hurst and Lyapunov
   Exponent revealed to identify two groups of sub-divisions with exactly
   similar region of every respect. Those two groups contain (i)
   sub-divisions Orissa and Assam and Meghalaya and also (ii) sub-divisions
   Sub Himalayan West Bengal and Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur and Tripura
   although those are at distances of hundreds of kilometers away. The
   behaviour of those subdivisions in a group has similar behaviour in all
   respects.},

   efficiency under droughts},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {The vegetation rain-use efficiency (RUE) represents the ability of an
   ecosystem to use rainfall and is an important descriptor of ecological
   functions of terrestrial system. Although studies have been conducted to
   investigate the impact of droughts on vegetation, we still lack critical
   understanding of how exactly RUE responds to droughts of different time
   scales and intensities. Here, we present evidence for a rapid response
   in RUE, and collapse points of RUE increase trend during droughts by
   using multi-source meteorological data and satellite-derived vegetation
   indices. The highest correlation was found consistently between RUE and
   computed drought index at time scale of 1 month for all biome types and
   climate regimes. We further discovered that RUE increased significantly
   with amplification of drought intensity to a maximum RUE, especially for
   semi-arid and arid biomes. As drought is prolonged, RUE increased till a
   tipping point was reached across all biomes and climatic conditions,
   indicating that the long-term droughts weaken the sensitivities of RUE
   to drought and threaten the resilience of ecosystem. This study
   comprehensively provides a satellite-based evaluation of RUE response to
   different drought features. We envisage that the findings would
   contribute to the development of drought early warning from an
   ecological perspective and to provide the sustainable environmental
   management.},

Abstract = {Changes in rainfall pattern are of significance in terms of water
   resource management, hydrological modelling, environmental hazard
   management and agricultural planning. In the present study I assess the
   annual and seasonal rainfall trend, including concentration in eight
   rainfall stations in Maldah district, located in the lower Gangetic
   plain of West Bengal, India during 1985-2015. Besides the Mann-Kendall
   test and Theil-Sen's estimator for assessing the trend of rainfall,
   precipitation concentration index (PCI) has been used to examine
   intra-annual rainfall variability. The study reveals decreasing trend of
   annual and monsoon rainfall in seven rainfall stations. Among them,
   significant trend is found in five and four rainfall stations
   respectively. This is followed by pre-monsoon and post-monsoon rainfall
   characterized with decreasing trend in five and eight rainfall stations
   respectively. The results of PCI show fluctuation of rainfall
   distribution in the district from moderate to strong irregular during
   the study period. However, decreasing trend of annual PCI values in the
   seven rainfall stations, with significant value in one of them, implies
   a tendency towards moderate rainfall distribution in the respective
   stations. Nevertheless, ChanchalI rainfall station solely showed
   increasing annual PCI value and thereby an affinity towards strong
   irregular distribution of rainfall. Despite decrease in annual and
   seasonal rainfall, increase of pre-June (May) and post-September
   (October) rainfall prolonged the rainy season, which is responsible for
   drainage congestion as well as seasonal inundation in low-lying areas of
   the district.},

Abstract = {Drought is generally associated with a long-term reduction in total
   precipitation. However, changes at shorter time-scales can also induce
   drought conditions. This study analyses trends of meteorological drought
   severity during the rainy season in the Indonesian maritime continent.
   We propose a new dry spell index to characterize this drought severity.
   The anomalous accumulation definition was used to define a single most
   intense rainy season for region with one or two rainy seasons per year.
   The Mann-Kendall test was applied for trend analysis of the index.
   Temporal and spatial drought characterisations were compared between the
   dry spell index and standardized precipitation index. The results show
   that in semi-annual and anti-monsoonal regimes the rainy season
   precipitation increases, the number of dry days decreases, and long dry
   spell contribution decreases, overall causing a decrease in drought
   severity. Over the same period, the number of dry days, duration of the
   extreme dry spell, and long dry spell contribution increased in the
   monsoon regime, indicating a tendency towards a drier condition. In
   contrast, standardized precipitation index showed a strong tendency
   towards a wetter condition during the rainy season over this region.},

Abstract = {Meghalaya is known to receive the most torrential rainfall in the world,
   but the region suffers from water shortage as soon as the rain recedes,
   and the dry season starts. Changes in rainfall patterns and distribution
   can have a profound impact on water availability in a watershed, and
   therefore, examining spatial and temporal variations in rainfall is
   essential. However, the long-term rainfall variations in Meghalaya are
   not well explored. In this study, we take up two important watersheds in
   Meghalaya, i.e. Umiam and Umtru watersheds, to study the spatial and
   temporal rainfall variations. Using the gridded rainfall data from the
   Indian Meteorological Department from 1901 to 2018, we show that annual,
   winter, pre-monsoon, and monsoon rainfall is decreasing, whereas the
   post-monsoon rainfall is increasing. We use the innovative trend
   analysis (ITA) method to identify the trends in low-, medium-, and
   high-intensity rainfall. We find that low- and medium-intensity rainfall
   is in decreasing trend while high-intensity rainfall is increasing
   across annual and seasonal time scales. Lastly, we cross-check the
   trends detected using the innovative trend analysis method with a widely
   accepted Mann-Kendall (MK) test. We find that the results obtained by
   using the two methods generally concur; however, the ITA can detect
   non-monotonic trends in different rainfall intensities and is more
   sensitive to hidden patterns than the MK test.},

Abstract = {This study investigated rainfall trends and their associations with
   tropical cyclones (TCs) during the period of 1979-2019, using TC
   best-track data from the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center
   Tokyo - Typhoon Center and daily rainfall data from 138 meteorological
   stations in Vietnam. The radius of influence of TCs on local rainfall
   was limited to 500 km from TC centers. The average annual number of TCs
   affecting Vietnam has decreased slightly in the last two decades
   compared to previous decades. The ratio of TC-induced rainfall to total
   rainfall attained the highest value of 37.3\% in the central region, in
   July. The temporal distribution of TC-induced rainfall coincided with
   the frequency of TCs, with an active period from June to November.
   During 1979-2019, the non-TC rainfall was the main contributor to the
   change in total rainfall, especially in relation to the decline in the
   north and the increase in the coastal South Central region. The rainfall
   trend during the entire period was principally explained by the
   interdecadal shift in the late 1990s. Rainfall intensity and the number
   of heavy rainfall days were intensified for total rainfall and non-TC
   rainfall, indicating that TCs contributed minimally to the changes of
   extreme rainfall events during 1979-2019.},

Abstract = {For improving sustainable water resources management and planning at
   local and regional scales, specifically in small islands, long-term and
   recent rainfall trends due to temporal shifts in major climatic drivers
   should be investigated based on dense and long-running ground data
   series - as done in this research work for the North Atlantic Portuguese
   island of Madeira (741 km(2)). Monthly, wet season and annual rainfall
   trends have been obtained via the non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) and
   the Sen's slope estimator tests for 41 rain gauges spanning from 1940/41
   to 2016/17 (77 hydrological years, each starting on October 1). By means
   of the Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test, abrupt temporal shifts in
   the wet season and annual rainfall, and in the North Atlantic
   Oscillation index (NAOI) series have been identified on the late 1960's
   - sandwiched by two subperiods with clearly opposite trends. In general,
   the results suggest considerably and statistically significant decreases
   in rainfall, exacerbated in recent years at the central region of the
   island - one of the most important locations in terms of fresh water
   security. Additionally, this work provides a solid basis to explain the
   climate change effects on the Madeira rainfall, suggesting that abrupt
   changes of the island's rainfall variability can be directly linked to
   those of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) climatic driver based on
   the strong established teleconnection. These findings are expected to
   contribute to the improvement of actions towards sustainable water
   management in the island, and of some other small islands with climatic
   characteristics influenced as well by large-scale circulation patterns.},

Title = {Rainfall Trends and Extremes in Saudi Arabia in Recent Decades},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The observed records of recent decades show increased economic damage
   associated with flash flooding in different regions of Saudi Arabia. An
   increase in extreme rainfall events may cause severe repercussions for
   the socio-economic sectors of the country. The present study
   investigated the observed rainfall trends and associated extremes over
   Saudi Arabia for the 42-year period of 1978-2019. It measured the
   contribution of extreme events to the total rainfall and calculated the
   changes to mean and extreme rainfall events over five different climate
   regions of Saudi Arabia. Rainfall indices were constructed by estimating
   the extreme characteristics associated with daily rainfall frequency and
   intensity. The analysis reveals that the annual rainfall is decreasing
   (5.89 mm decade(-1), significant at the 90\% level) over Saudi Arabia
   for the entire analysis period, while it increased in the most recent
   decade. On a monthly scale, the most significant increase (5.44 mm
   decade(-1)) is observed in November and the largest decrease (1.20 mm
   decade(-1)) in January. The frequency of intense rainfall events is
   increasing for the majority of stations over Saudi Arabia, while the
   frequency of weak events is decreasing. More extreme rainfall events are
   occurring in the northwest, east, and southwest regions of Saudi Arabia.
   A daily rainfall of >= 26 mm is identified as the threshold for an
   extreme event. It is found that the contribution of extreme events to
   the total rainfall amount varies from region to region and season to
   season. The most considerable contribution (up to 56\%) is found in the
   southern region in June. Regionally, significant contribution comes from
   the coastal region, where extreme events contribute, on average, 47\% of
   the total rainfall each month from October to February, with the largest
   (53\%) in November. For the entire country, extreme rainfall contributes
   most (52\%) in November and least (20\%) in July, while contributions
   from different stations are in the 8-50\% range of the total rainfall.},

Abstract = {In order to investigate the tendency in rainfall amount in Calabria
   (southern Italy), in this work, monthly rainfall series were first
   tested for homogeneity and then a trend analysis was performed. In
   particular, a homogenization approach based on the Climatol method was
   applied to homogenize monthly climatological series. Then, the
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and the Theil-Sen estimator were
   applied to evaluate the presence of trends and their significance in the
   monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall series. Moreover, the trend slopes
   were further evaluated with a linear regression analysis. At the annual
   scale, results evidenced a decreasing trend mainly in the north-eastern
   part of the region. At the seasonal scale, a spatial distributed
   negative trend in winter, and a positive trend in summer, mainly
   localized in the north-western part of the region, were identified.
   Finally, on a monthly scale negative trends spreading across the region
   were detected in January and December, with an opposite behavior in July
   and especially in September, when almost the entire region presented a
   positive trend.},

Title = {Trend Analysis of Rainfall Time Series in Shanxi Province, Northern
   China (1957-2019)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Changes in rainfall play an important role in agricultural production,
   water supply and management, and social and economic development in arid
   and semi-arid regions. The objective of this study was to examine the
   trend of rainfall series from 18 meteorological stations for monthly,
   seasonal, and annual scales in Shanxi province over the period
   1957-2019. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Spearman's Rho (SR) test, and the
   Revised Mann-Kendall (RMK) test were used to identify the trends. Sen's
   slope estimator (SSE) was used to estimate the magnitude of the rainfall
   trend. An autocorrelation function (ACF) plot was used to examine the
   autocorrelation coefficients at various lags in order to improve the
   trend analysis by the application of the RMK test. The results indicate
   remarkable differences with positive and negative trends (significant or
   non-significant) depending on stations. The largest number of stations
   showing decreasing trends occurred in March, with 10 out of 18 stations
   at the 10\%, 5\%, and 1\% levels. Wutai Shan station has strong negative
   trends in January, March, April, November, and December at the level of
   1\%. In addition, Wutai Shan station also experienced a significant
   decreasing trend over four seasons at a significance level of 1\% and
   10\%. On the annual scale, there was no significant trend detected by
   the three identification methods for most stations. MK and SR tests have
   similar power for detecting monotonic trends in rainfall time series
   data. Although similar results were obtained by the MK/SR and RMK tests
   in this study, in some cases, unreasonable trends may be provided by the
   RMK test. The findings of this study could benefit agricultural
   production activities, water supply and management, drought monitoring,
   and socioeconomic development in Shanxi province in the future.},

Title = {Projecting the future of rainfall extremes: Better classic than trendy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {588},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Non-stationarity approaches have been increasingly popular in hydrology,
   reflecting scientific concerns regarding intensification of the water
   cycle due to global warming. A considerable share of relevant studies is
   dominated by the practice of identifying linear trends in data through
   in-sample analysis. In this work, we reframe the problem of trend
   identification using the out-of-sample predictive performance of trends
   as a reference point. We devise a systematic methodological framework in
   which linear trends are compared to simpler mean models, based on their
   performance in predicting climatic-scale (30-year) annual rainfall
   indices, i.e. maxima, totals, wet-day average and probability dry, from
   long-term daily records. The models are calibrated in two different
   schemes: block-moving, i.e. fitted on the recent 30 years of data,
   obtaining the local trend and local mean, and global-moving, i.e. fitted
   on the whole period known to an observer moving in time, thus obtaining
   the global trend and global mean. The investigation of empirical records
   spanning over 150 years of daily data suggests that a great degree of
   variability has been ever present in the rainfall process, leaving small
   potential for long-term predictability. The local mean model ranks first
   in terms of average predictive performance, followed by the global mean
   and the global trend, in decreasing order of performance, while the
   local trend model ranks last among the models, showing the worst
   performance overall. Parallel experiments from synthetic timeseries
   characterized by persistence corroborated this finding, suggesting that
   future long-term variability of persistent processes is better captured
   using parsimonious features of the past. In line with the empirical
   findings, it is shown that, prediction-wise, simple is preferable to
   trendy.},

Abstract = {Impact of climate change over the hydrological system in a region can be
   identified through statistical characterization of hydrometeorological
   parameters such as rainfall, temperature, humidity and evaporation. In
   order to understand the influence of climate change, statistical trend
   characteristics of rainy days, non-rainy days and evaporation rate in
   the Limbang River Basin (LRB) in Sarawak, Malaysia, Northern Borneo was
   assessed in the present research. iknnual rainfall and monthly
   evaporation data, over a period of 46 years, (1970 - 2015) corresponding
   to three rain gauging stations, the Limbang DID, Ukong and Long Napir
   were used in the research. Linear regression model. Mann Kendall and
   Sen's slope estimator techniques were applied to detect the statistical
   trends in rainy days and evaporation. A statistically significant
   increasing trend in annual rainy days was found at all the stations.
   Non-rainy days showed a statistically significant decreasing trend at
   Limbang DID and Ukong. Monthly evaporation rates showed an overall
   increasing trend and the greatest increasing trend in evaporation was
   observed in September (2.55 num'year) for the Limbang DID and in
   December (2.61 min/year) for Ukong. Evaporation measured at the Ukong
   station also showed a non-significant decrease during June and
   September. A comparison of the evaporation controlling meteorological
   variables such as rainfall, temperature and relative humidity indicates
   inter-influence at various strengths. Along with local precipitation
   characteristics, wind and fluctuation of atmospheric temperature over
   the region plays a vital role in increased rate of evaporation from the
   region. Overall, the analysis identified a statistically significant
   increasing trend in rainy days and evaporation in the LRB. The results
   of the present research can be used as critical planning data for micro
   and macro hydroelectric projects in the river basin.},

   Florida},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Trends in the extreme rainfall regimes were analyzed at 24 stations of
   Florida for four analysis periods: 1950-2010, 1960-2010, 1970-2010, and
   1980-2010. A trend-free pre-whitening approach was utilized to correct
   data for autocorrelations. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and
   Theil-Sen approach were employed to detect and estimate trends in the
   magnitude of annual maximum rainfalls and in the number of annual
   above-threshold events (i.e., frequency). A bootstrap resampling
   approach was used to account for cross-correlations across sites and
   evaluate the global significance of trends at the 10\% level (p-value <=
   0.10). Dominant locally significant (p-value <= 0.10) increasing trends
   were found in the magnitudes of 1-12 h extreme rainfalls for the longest
   period, and in 6 h to 7 day rainfalls for the shortest period. The
   trends in 2-12 h rainfalls were also globally significant (i.e.,
   exceeded the trends that could occur by chance). In contrast, globally
   significant decreasing trends were noted in the annual number of 1-3 h,
   1-6 h, and 3-6 h extreme rainfalls during 1950-2010, 1960-2010, and
   1980-2010, respectively. Trends in the number of 1-7 day extreme
   rainfalls were mixed, lacking global significance. Our findings would
   guide stormwater management in tropical/subtropical environments of
   Florida and around the world.},

Title = {Comparison of Different Analyzing Techniques in Identifying Rainfall
   Trends for Colombo, Sri Lanka},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Identifying rainfall trends in highly urbanized area is extremely
   important for various planning and implementation activities, including
   designing, maintaining and controlling of water distribution networks
   and sewer networks and mitigating flood damages. However, different
   available methods in trend analysis may produce comparable and
   contrasting results. Therefore, this paper presents an attempt in
   comparing some of the trend analysis methods using one of the highly
   urbanized areas in Sri Lanka, Colombo. Recorded rainfall data for 10
   gauging stations for 30 years were tested using the MannKendall test,
   Sen's slope estimator, Spearman's rho test, and innovative graphical
   method. Results showcased comparable findings among three trend
   identification methods. Even though the graphical method is easier, it
   is advised to use it with a proper statistical method due to its
   identification difficulties when the data scatter has some outliers.
   Nevertheless, it was found herein that Colombo is under a downward
   rainfall trend in the month of July where the area receives its major
   rainfall events. In addition, the area has several upward rainfall
   trends over the minor seasons and in the annual scale. Therefore, the
   water management activities in the area have to be revisited for a
   sustainable use of water resources.},

Abstract = {We analyse long-term (1900-2017) rainfall data in the southern part of
   the winter rainfall region of southern Africa to understand the spatial
   patterns of recent and long-term trends and contextualize the 2015-2017
   rainfall anomalies which led to the so-called ``Day Zero{''} drought in
   Cape Town. Our analyses reveal cohesive spatial patterns and seasonal
   differences in rainfall trends across a range of timescales. These
   suggest that rainfall is subject to regional driving mechanisms,
   predominantly manifested at the 20-50 year timescale, but the influence
   of these mechanisms is modified by subregional and seasonally specific
   processes, frequently resulting in trends of different magnitudes and
   even sign. Trend patterns are consistent with multidecadal-scale
   quasi-periodicity, with only the most recent phase (post-1981 drying)
   corresponding to the expected regional response to hemispheric processes
   linked to anthropogenic climate change. The spatial and seasonal
   patterns of drying observed since 1981 alone do not explain the pattern
   of 2015-2017 drought anomalies, although they share a strong autumn and
   weak mid-winter signal. These results have implications to the
   interpretation of drought in the context of observed rainfall trends.
   Furthermore, we identify directions for improvement of the conceptual
   understanding of drivers of rainfall variability and the role of
   anthropogenic climate change in the winter rainfall region of South
   Africa.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to determine the temporal variations of rainfall
   trend in the Vidarbha region, India as a prerequisite for the
   flood-drought optimization of the area. Historic rainfall data from
   India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Institute of Tropical
   Meteorology (IITM), Pune, were taken for a time period of 1951-2005 and
   is correlated. Data from IITM is a variable resolution Global Model,
   based on the Laboratorie Dynamique Meteorologie, France (LMDz). The
   correlation of LMDz model data with the IMD data was calculated using
   four statistical variables: Correlation Coefficient (CC), Normalized
   Root Mean Square Deviation (NRMSD), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and
   Skill Score (SS). Both data were further used for calculating the
   rainfall trend using non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's Slope
   estimator and results were compared. There observed a good correlation
   between the data series from IMD and IITM. Hence projected rainfall data
   from IITM, for a period of 2020-2095 has been used to get a line about
   the future rainfall pattern of the area. The future rainfall trend
   scenario of Vidarbha is not favorable; hence proper water resources
   strategy should be defined to avoid desertification of the area.},

Title = {Drought in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa and trends in
   rainfall characteristics},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {2743-2759},

Abstract = {Much of the Eastern Cape province in South Africa has been experiencing
   a severe drought since 2015. This drought has had major socio-economic
   effects particularly on the large impoverished rural population as well
   as on some urban areas where supplied water services have broken down in
   several cases. The region is influenced by both midlatitude and tropical
   systems leading to a complex regional meteorology that hitherto has not
   been much studied compared to other parts of South Africa. Here, the
   ongoing drought is examined in the context of long-term trends and the
   interannual rainfall variability of the region. Although the region has
   experienced drought in all seasons since 2015, focus here is placed on
   the spring (September-November) which shows the most consistent and
   robust signal. On average, this season contributes between about 25-35\%
   of the annual rainfall total. Based on CHIRPS data, it is found that
   this season shows a significant decreasing trend in both rainfall totals
   as well as the number of rainfall days (but not heavy rainfall days) for
   spring over most of the province since 1981. On interannual time scales,
   the results indicate that dry (wet) springs over the Eastern Cape are
   associated with a cyclonic (anticyclonic) anomaly southeast of South
   Africa as part of a shift in the zonal wavenumber 3 pattern in the
   midlatitudes. Over the landmass, a stronger (weaker) Botswana High is
   also apparent with increased (decreased) subsidence over and near the
   Eastern Cape which is less (more) favourable for cloud band development
   and hence reduced (enhanced) rainfall during dry (wet) springs. Analysis
   of mid-century (2040-2060) CMIP5 rainfall projections suggests that
   there may be a flattening of the annual cycle over the Eastern Cape with
   the winter becoming wetter and the summer drier. For the spring season
   of interest here, the multi-model projections also indicate drying but
   less pronounced than that projected for the summer.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to assess relatively new hybrid methods for
   changes points and trends detection on rainfall series: Dynamic
   Programming Bayesian Change Point Approach (BA), Sen's innovative trend
   method (ITM) and its double (D-ITM) and triple (T-ITM) version using the
   multi-scale analysis of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as a
   coupling method. Three representatives rainfall stations of northern
   Algeria were analysed at annual scale during the period 1920-2011.
   Moreover, correlation and spectral analysis (CSA) was applied for
   periodicity analysis. The CSA indicates the dominance of interannual to
   multidecadal rainfall periodicity fluctuations (2-years, 5-years and
   20-years) characterising long term structured processes. Moreover, an
   abrupt downward trend with significant probability was detected from the
   1970s with a relatively wet period between the periods 1950-1970 and
   2001-2011. The latter is observed in particular in the central and
   eastern stations, well-explained by the BA-DWT. The results showed that
   the comparison results from different modelling approaches found that
   the hybrid models (BA-DWT, ITM-DWT, D-ITM-DWT, T-ITM-DWT) often perform
   better than the conventional approach (BA, ITM, D-ITM, T-ITM), where the
   computation time is very reasonable. The analysis revealed that
   information stemming from discrete wavelet spectrums significantly
   increased the accuracy of the methods for detecting hidden change points
   and trends.},

Title = {Changing Trends in Rainfall Extremes in the Metropolitan Area of Sao
   Paulo: Causes and Impacts},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {This study analyses observed trends in extreme rainfall events in the
   Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP). Rainfall data sets with more than
   60 years of record in MASP are used. In MASP, extreme rainfall events
   represent hydro meteorological hazards that trigger flash floods and
   landslides. Changes in rainfall extremes can be partly due to natural
   climate variability. In addition, it can also be related to global
   warming and/or urbanization. Total annual precipitation and the number
   of days with precipitation of 20 mm exhibit the largest significant
   increase during 1930-2019. This is better noticed during summer. This
   tendency is also noticed in the number of days with precipitation of 100
   mm or more. Therefore, the positive trend in annual precipitation is
   mainly due to an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation
   events. On the other hand, our analysis shows that the number of
   consecutive dry days increased. Though these results appear to be
   contradictory, they indicate an important climate change in recent
   times. Intense precipitation is concentrated in few days, separated by
   longer dry spells. The focus is on how atmospheric circulation
   variations are contributing to these changes. During 1960-2019 the South
   Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone has intensified and slightly moved
   southwestward of its normal position. This change influences the
   transport of humidity and therefore impact precipitation. This can
   explain the increase in the precipitation extremes in the MASP. However,
   other atmospheric systems may also be important.},

Abstract = {Climate change has serious impacts on meteorological processes that have
   significant control on water resource planning, development, and
   management. These impacts emerge in the form of trends. The present
   study was undertaken to assess the temporal trends of annual rainfall
   and rainy days in Jodhpur and Kota zones of Rajasthan, India, using
   nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK), modified Mann-Kendall (MMK), and
   Theil-Sen slope estimator tests along with innovative trend analysis
   (ITA) method based on 60 years data (1957-2016). Spatial trend analysis
   was accomplished using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method. Out
   of 34 stations in the Jodhpur zone, the annual rainfall at eight
   stations had a statistically significant increasing trend at a 5\% level
   of significance. In the case of annual rainy days, only two stations
   showed a significant increasing trend. The ITA method was found to be
   superior to the MK test as it was able to identify trends in different
   clusters which were not done by the MK test as it gives monotonous
   trends only. The significantly increasing trends in rainfall at eight
   stations in the Jodhpur zone revealed the impact of climate change in
   the Rajasthan state which is considered as an arid state. This could be
   attributed to various anthropogenic and climatic activities taking place
   in this region. The results of this study could serve as a preliminary
   information for water resources and agricultural planning and management
   and designing of soil and water conservation structures for improving
   the water availability status of the region which would aid in a
   sustainable development of the resources at a decentralized level.},

Abstract = {In this research, a new framework has been introduced for rainfall
   temporal variability evaluation by using combination of monthly rainfall
   data sets in three synoptic stations, Principal Component Analysis
   (PCA), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Grasshopper
   Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA)
   methodology. The first five components were chosen as inputs of the
   soft-computing models, based on PCA. The GOA was used for training the
   ANFIS model, in order to estimate the monthly rainfall. The outputs of
   the ANFIS-GOA were compared to the rainfall estimates by ANFIS-Particle
   Swarm Optimization (ANFIS-PSO) and ANFIS-Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA).
   Moreover, various statistical indices, such as mean absolute error
   (MAE), percent bias (PBIAS) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) were
   used to evaluate the soft-computing models' performance. Results
   indicated that ANFIS-GOA had higher accuracy in estimating the rainfall
   (values of MAE, NSE and PBIAS were 0.21, 0.92 and 0.16 for Mehrabad
   station, 0.16, 0.94 and 0.14 for Semnan station and 0.24, 0.91 and 0.17
   for Noshahr station, respectively) in the testing phase. These values
   showed significant improvements (67.8\%, 21\% and 40\% for Mehrabad
   station, 69.2\%, 17.5\% and 33.3\% for Semnan station and 57.1\%, 21.3\%
   and 37\% for Noshahr station) versus indices related to standalone ANFIS
   model, which reflected the supremacy and higher accuracy of ANFIS-GOA
   model in rainfall prediction for different climatic conditions. It was
   also concluded that the ANFIS-GOA, ANFIS-PSO, and ANFIS-GA models
   performed superior to the standalone ANFIS-based model, respectively.
   Furthermore, possible trends in monthly rainfall have been detected by
   ITA, which is a new graphical model. Results showed significant
   decreasing trends in January and July for all the rainfall values in
   Mehrabad station. By comparison of the results obtained from ANFIS and
   the hybrid models with observed data, it was also concluded that the
   trends of observed data were close to the ANFIS-GOA predictions.},

Title = {Detecting Rainfall Trend and Development of Future Intensity Duration
   Frequency (IDF) Curve for the State of Kelantan},

Abstract = {Due to global warming, the existing IDF curves that were derived from
   historical data may no longer valid for estimating future rainfall. On
   the other hand, the alternative future rainfall data generated from
   Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) cannot be used directly
   due to systematic biases caused by non-inclusion of local features.
   Quantile mapping was used to bias correct the rainfall data generated by
   CCSM3 model based on the properties of observed rainfall. Only 4 out of
   16 stations in the state of Kelantan have shown an increasing
   significant trend for 1-h annual maximum rainfall. The best transfer
   function used to correct bias in CCSM3 data is the second order
   polynomial function. The quantile mapping for bias correction is
   satisfactory as the highest RMSE was only 4.045, a reduction by 15\%
   compared to the original CCSM3 data. Subsequently, a unique transfer
   function was developed to represent the behavior of CCSM3 and observed
   data for each station. The future intensity was found to increase for
   short and medium return periods of 2-, 5-, 10- and 25-year, where most
   of the stations have Climate Change Factor (CCF) larger than 1. On the
   contrary, for a longer return period of 50- and 100-year, the
   intensities are predicted to be lower.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate aspects related to the changing
   trends of the rainfall extremes in the entire Mekong Delta in the period
   of 32 years (1984-2015) applying rainfall extreme indices. First, the
   homogeneity tests were applied to assess the quality of observed
   rainfall data series. The authors, then, investigated three rainfall
   indices including the number of very heavy rainfall days 20 mm (R20),
   number of days above 50 mm (R50) and number of days above 100 mm (R100)
   applying the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimate.
   Design/methodology/approach First, the homogeneity tests were applied to
   assess the quality of observed rainfall data series. The authors, then,
   investigated three rainfall indices including the number of very heavy
   rainfall days 20 mm (R20), number of days above 50 mm (R50) and number
   of days above 100 mm (R100) applying the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's
   slope estimate. Findings The results of R20 pointed out that an
   insignificant upward tendency was found in the coastal provinces,
   whereas an insignificant downward tendency was also recorded in the
   inland provinces. Regarding the number of R50, a similar trend to R20
   was recorded with five stations slightly increased and five stations
   slightly decreased. For the number of R100, the results recorded an
   absence of significant trends over the entire study area. Approximately
   58.5\% of stations show a slightly decreasing trend, while 41.5\% of the
   remaining stations recorded a slightly increasing trend.
   Originality/value For the number of R100, the results recorded an
   absence of the significant trends over the entire study area.
   Approximately 58.5\% of stations show a slightly decreasing trend, while
   41.5\% of the remaining stations recorded a slightly increasing trend.
   Of note is the fact that the number of R100 occurred more frequently in
   the northern provinces, which means the northern region is facing a high
   risk of flooding.},

Title = {Rainfall Analysis over the Niger Central Hydrological Area, Nigeria:
   Variability, Trend, and Change point detection},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Rainfall data are a vital meteorological input to agricultural modelling
   systems and water resources planning and management studies. In this
   study, CRU data (CRU\_TS 4.01) was used to investigate spatiotemporal
   variability of rainfall at 33 sub-basins of the Niger Central
   Hydrological Area (NCHA), Nigeria, over 105 years (1911-2015). For
   Rainfall variability studies, rainfall variability index, precipitation
   concentration index, and linear regression model (LRM) were employed.
   Trend analysis and change point detection were done using nonparametric
   Mann-Kendall (MK) tests, Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (NSHT), and
   Pettitt's test (PT), and for spatial analysis of rainfall, kriging
   interpolation method was used. Rainfall variability index showed that
   1983 and 1911 were the wettest and driest years, respectively, while
   1921-1930 and 1981-1990 were the wettest and driest decades,
   respectively. Precipitation concentration index indicated that the NCHA
   had experienced 61\% moderate rainfall and 39\% high concentration
   rainfall. LRM showed that the change in the mean annual rainfall, early
   rainy season, and the main (or late) rainy season had occurred at the
   rate of -0.30 mm/year, -0.27 mm/year, and -0.23 mm/year, respectively.
   MK results showed that except for sub-basins 21 and 22 (which are
   positive), all other subbasins have a negative trend signifying a
   decrease in trends of rainfalls. NSHT and PT suggested 1969 as the
   probable change point for the whole basin. The decrease in the amount of
   rainfall (after the change point) indicates a drier condition over the
   basin. Therefore, farmers and water resources personnel need to focus
   attention on the management of this vital resource by making the right
   choice of what and when to plant and managing the water crisis (drought
   and floods) which emanates from erratic rainfall. (C) 2020 The

   been compared with the ones obtained with the Mann-Kendall test. These
   analyses have been performed in five rainfall zones (RZs) of the study
   area, characterized by different climatic conditions. As a result, both
   the methods evidenced a negative trend of the annual rainfall in the
   entire study area. On a seasonal scale, this negative tendency has been
   confirmed in autumn and winter although with some differences among the
   several RZs.},

Journal = {WATER},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to affect the occurrence of heavy rainfall.
   We analyzed trends of heavy rainfall days for the last decades in
   Germany. For all available stations with daily data, days exceeding
   daily thresholds (10, 20, 30 mm) were counted annually. The Mann-Kendall
   trend test was applied to overlapping periods of 30 years (1951-2019).
   This period was extended to 1901 for 111 stations. The stations were
   aggregated by natural regions to assess regional patterns. Impacts of
   data inconsistencies on the calculated trends were evaluated with the
   metadata and recent hourly data. Although the trend variability depended
   on the chosen exceedance threshold, a general long-term trend for the
   whole of Germany was consistently not evident. After 1951, stable
   positive trends occurred in the mountainous south and partly in the
   northern coastal region, while parts of Central Germany experienced
   negative trends. The frequent location shifts and the recent change in
   the time interval for daily rainfall could affect individual trends but
   were statistically insignificant for regional analyses. A case study
   supported that heavy rains became more erosive during the last 20 years.
   The results showed the merit of historical data for a better
   understanding of recent changes in heavy rainfall.},

   Extreme Value Distribution: Uncertainty Minimization and Implications
   for Trend Detection},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {The accurate estimation of hydrologic extremes is central to planning
   and engineering mitigation and adaptation measures. The traditional
   extreme value theory is based on often overlooked assumptions that
   preclude the use of all available observations and negatively affect
   estimation uncertainty. The Metastatistical Extreme Value Distribution
   (MEVD) was introduced to make full use of available data and was shown
   to significantly improve estimation uncertainty for large extremes.
   However, no systematic understanding existed as to how to optimally
   apply the MEVD depending on the statistical properties of the observed
   variables. With reference to daily rainfall, we identify here the local
   climatic factors that define the optimal MEVD formulation. We analyze a
   large set of long daily rainfall records, as well as synthetic time
   series with prescribed statistical characteristics, and find that (1) in
   most climates the MEVD should be based on yearly estimates of the
   ordinary rainfall distributions, and only in climates with less thann
   over bar =20-25 year the estimation of distributional/year the
   estimation of distributional parameters requires samples longer than 1
   year; (2) the interannual variability in the distributions of rainfall
   should be explicitly resolved whenn over bar >20-25 rainy days/year.
   Finally, we use the optimized MEVD to study the variability of daily
   rainfall extremes over 294 years in Padova (Italy) and compare it to
   traditional extreme value estimates. We find that, through its improved
   accuracy for short observations, MEVD better resolves high-quantile
   fluctuations and allows the emergence of long-term trends over
   estimation noise.},

Title = {PERSIANN-CDR based characterization and trend analysis of annual
   rainfall in Rio De Janeiro State, Brazil},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Climate Data analysis has become a fundamental tool for scientists who
   seek to better evaluate changes in climatic variables worldwide. When it
   comes to rainfall there are many datasets publicly available, and
   orbital products have been gradually sharpening its results. The
   Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using
   Artificial Neural Networks - Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) annual
   product is used in this study to characterize rainfall variation over
   the state of Rio de Janeiro (SRJ), considering the period of 1983 to
   2017. A rainfall dataset with 35 year long series for each of the 92
   municipalities of the SRJ was created using GIS software. Several
   statistical tests were then applied to the datasets of each municipality
   in order to verify normality (Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling, Lilliefors
   and Jarque-Bera), homogeneity (Pettitt, SNHT, Buishand and von Neumann),
   trends (Mann-Kendall) and intensity (en) of reduction or increase in
   annual rainfall. The estimated rainfall datasets were classified mainly
   as normal and homogenous (non-significant breakpoints), but significant
   breakpoints were registered by the Buishand's test in the dataset of
   twenty seven (29.34\%) municipalities. Twenty municipalities had their
   estimated datasets compared to local meteorological stations in order to
   verify PERSIANN-CDR performance over the SRJ. Municipalities in the
   Middle Paraiba and Center South regions are the wettest of the state,
   while locations that presented lower average annual rainfalls in the
   state are concentrated in the North, Coastal Flats and Northwest
   regions. Alarming trends of reduction in annual rainfall were identified
   for all municipalities using the MK test, but to the threshold of 95\%
   reliability, results show fifty four (58.69\%) municipalities located in
   the central and western parts of the SRJ. According to Sen `s test the
   intensity of annual rainfall reduction is greater in municipalities of
   the Middle Paraiba and Green Coast regions, but Center South,
   Metropolitan and Coastal Flats regions also registered disquieting
   results. PERSIANN-CDR analysis can be considered an efficient
   methodology in the characterization of rainfall variability and trend
   detection for the SRJ, being encouraged for future studies addressing
   rainfall and drought variability over the state. The analysis of the
   PERSIANN-CDR products should also be applied in other regions of the
   country, especially considering the remarkable interannual and
   intraseasonal variability of rainfall in Brazil.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes and forecasts the long-term Spatio-temporal changes
   in rainfall using the data from 1901 to 2015 across India at
   meteorological divisional level. The Pettitt test was employed to detect
   the abrupt change point in time frame, while the Mann-Kendall (MK) test
   and Sen's Innovative trend analysis were performed to analyze the
   rainfall trend. The Artificial Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron
   (ANN-MLP) was employed to forecast the upcoming 15 years rainfall across
   India. We mapped the rainfall trend pattern for whole country by using
   the geo-statistical technique like Kriging in ArcGIS environment.
   Results show that the most of the meteorological divisions exhibited
   significant negative trend of rainfall in annual and seasonal scales,
   except seven divisions during. Out of 17 divisions, 11 divisions
   recorded noteworthy rainfall declining trend for the monsoon season at
   0.05\% significance level, while the insignificant negative trend of
   rainfall was detected for the winter and pre-monsoon seasons.
   Furthermore, the significant negative trend (-8.5) was recorded for
   overall annual rainfall. Based on the findings of change detection, the
   most probable year of change detection was occurred primarily after 1960
   for most of the meteorological stations. The increasing rainfall trend
   had observed during the period 1901-1950, while a significant decline
   rainfall was detected after 1951. The rainfall forecast for upcoming 15
   years for all the meteorological divisions' also exhibit a significant
   decline in the rainfall. The results derived from ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis
   data exhibit that increasing/decreasing precipitation convective rate,
   elevated low cloud cover and inadequate vertically integrated moisture
   divergence might have influenced on change of rainfall in India.
   Findings of the study have some implications in water resources
   management considering the limited availability of water resources and
   increase in the future water demand.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1970s, the agricultural frontier of southeastern Amazon
   has undergone extensive land use changes. These alterations, combined
   with regional climate changes, have the potential to influence the
   hydrologic cycle at small to large scales. We evaluated a 40-year time
   series (1976 to 2015) of rainfall and water yield and related them to
   land use changes in the Upper Xingu River Basin (UX). We acquired data
   from six rainfall stations and four river gauges and mapped land use
   changes. Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Pettitt's change point
   detection were employed to describe annual and seasonal changes in the
   time series. Monthly water yield from the Xingu River was used to derive
   annual, seasonal, and monthly water yield, as well as the runoff
   coefficient. The largest changes in land use occurred during the last
   two decades and approximately 60,900 km(2) in the Upper Xingu Basin were
   deforested between 1985 and 2015. Rainfall in the Xingu Basin decreased
   by about 245 mm over the period but there was no trend in water yield.
   The number of rainy days and intensity of events also decreased, but the
   length of the rainy season and seasonal and annual water yield did not
   change. Although watershed deforestation has increased water yield in
   other Amazon rivers, the reduction in rainfall in the Upper Xingu Basin
   was high enough to mask this effect.},

Abstract = {Two means by which climate change may increase surface soil erosion in
   mountainous terrain are: (1) increasing the frequency of extreme
   rainfall events and (2) decreasing the duration of snow cover on bare
   soil. We used output from four general circulation models (GCMs) and two
   greenhouse gas trajectories to produce a suite of hydrologic variables
   at a daily time-step for historic and projected 21st Century conditions.
   We statistically disaggregated the daily rainfall to hourly, using
   hourly rainfall from a network of nine weather stations in the Tahoe
   Basin, and filtered out rain falling on a snowpack. We applied published
   equations to convert hourly intensity to raindrop kinetic energy (KE)
   for each day and grid cell in the Basin, averaged across grid cells, and
   created time series of total annual and maximum annual hourly kinetic
   energy (TKE and MKE) on snow-free ground. Using the Generalized Extreme
   Value distribution, we calculated the significance of long-term trends
   in KE on snow-free ground, and estimated energy levels for return
   periods of 2, 20, and 100 years. We then detrended the snowpack data and
   compared the resulting trends in KE with the trends resulting from
   changes in both rainfall energy and snowpack under two GCMs. Principal
   findings include (1) upward trends in MKE, (2) stronger upward trends in
   TKE; and (3) an effect of increasing rainfall intensities on KE in some
   cases, and a strong effect of reduced snowpack in all cases examined.},

Abstract = {Analysis of rainfall trend may help to identify local and regional
   critical control factors that regulate rainfall pattern. Oscillation in
   the local trend may be governed by global events like climate change.
   Moreover, regional level trend analysis of climatic factors would
   divulge the mechanism of interplay between the impact of climate change
   and the effect of local phenomena like human activity. Therefore trend
   analysis of decadal rainfall time series (2001-2010) over 2 major rivers
   of Tripura coupled with a GIS based spatio-temporal simulation of the
   region was done. Regression model of the smoothen rainfall time series
   revealed clear decline for both rivers (y = -0.6793x + 243.99 and y =
   -0.1792x + 193.68 for Khowai and Gumti respectively). A systematic
   meta-analysis of meteorological reports for the period 1871-2017 was
   done to generate a collective climatic conscience of the region in
   tabular form, that also ascertained decreasing rainfall trend. This
   study may aid to pin point the specific regional factors that impact
   rainfall, which is in contrast to the general circulation models that
   only focus on global events in a very large area. Land use pattern, land
   cover changes and under developed agriculture practices are some
   anthropogenic factors that may be accounted for steady decrease of
   monsoon rainfall leading to man-made climate change.},

Title = {Rainfall Variability and Trend Analysis of Rainfall in West Africa
   (Senegal, Mauritania, Burkina Faso)},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study concerns the West African Sahel. The Sahelian climate is
   characterized by a long dry season and a rainy season which starts in
   June and ends in September-October. This latter season is associated
   with the process of oceanic moisture transfer to the mainland (the West
   African Monsoon). This movement is governed by an overall moving of the
   meteorological equator and its low-pressure corridor (Intertropical
   Convergence Zone, ITCZ) towards the north, under the effect of the
   attraction of the Saharan thermal depressions and a greater vigor of the
   anticyclonic nuclei. This study was conducted on 27 Sahelian climatic
   stations in three countries (Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Senegal). The
   method used to determine the modes of this variability and the trends of
   rainfall is the chronological graphic method of information processing
   (MGCTI) of the ``Bertin Matrix{''} and continuous wavelets transform
   (CWT). Results show a rain resumption observed in the recent years over
   the Sahelian region and a convincing link with the surface temperature
   of the Atlantic Ocean.},

Title = {Rainfall and runoff trend analysis in the Limpopo river basin using the
   Mann Kendall statistic},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An in-depth understanding of rainfall and runoff patterns of a catchment
   is central to sustainable water resources management and enhanced
   disaster risk reduction. This makes it important for studies in rainfall
   and runoff analysis to be carried out in developing countries like
   Zimbabwe. This study endeavoured to understand the rainfall patterns and
   the resultant runoff downstream along the Limpopo River. The study
   focused on the lower part of Mzingwane Catchment; which is a sub basin
   of the Limpopo River. Monthly observed data for four rainfall and two
   runoff stations were used for the study. Trend analysis of the data for
   the period 1949-2015 was conducted using Mann Kendal and Sen Slope
   Tests. The Seasonal Kendal test was applied to observe the influence of
   seasonal variations in rainfall and runoff. Trend analysis of rainfall
   patterns carried out for West Nicholson, Beitbridge and Chiredzi
   rainfall stations revealed an insignificant decreasing trend in rainfall
   activity at p < 0.05. However, Gwanda recorded an increasing rainfall
   trend though insignificant. Runoff activity at B62 Doddieburn station
   upstream of the catchment showed a declining trend while the B35 Limpopo
   River station exhibited an increase in river runoff. The overall p-value
   (of 0.03) for B35 station was below 0.05 thereby suggesting that there
   was a significant trend observed in the dataset. The increase in runoff
   at B35 could be attributed to managed releases from dams upstream. The
   study recommends measurement of all dam water releases and enhanced
   environmental management upstream and within the catchment in general.},

Abstract = {This study analysed long-term rainfall data (1851-2006) over seven
   climatic zones of India at seasonal and annual scales based on three
   techniques: (i) linear regression, (ii) multifractal detrended
   fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and (iii) Bayesian algorithm. The linear
   regression technique was used for trend analysis of short-term (30
   years) and long-term (156 years) rainfall data. The MFDFA revealed
   small- and large-scale fluctuations, whereas the Bayesian algorithm
   helped in quantifying the uncertainty in break-point detection from the
   rainfall time series. Major break points years identified through
   Bayesian algorithm were 1888, 1904 and 1976. The MFDFA technique
   identified that high fluctuation years were between 1871-1890, 1891-1910
   and 1951-1970. Linear regression-based analysis revealed 1881-1910 and
   1971-2006 as break-point periods in the North Mountainous Indian region.
   A similar analysis was carried out for India as a whole, as well as its
   seven climatic zones.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal trends in the frequency of daily rainfall in Bangladesh

Volume = {141},

Abstract = {Bangladesh is greatly susceptible to the impacts of climate change.
   Climate change has enhanced the frequency and intensity of extreme
   events in Bangladesh, thus resulting in loss of biodiversity and
   agricultural crop production. However, trend studies in the frequency of
   climatic variables like rainfall at the micro-scale are less explored in
   the previous literature. Therefore, this study aims to explore the
   spatiotemporal trends in the frequency of daily rainfall using different
   statistical models based on 23 station data from 1975 to 2017 in
   Bangladesh. The statistical results show that the frequency of rainfall
   ranges of < 5 mm, > 10 to <= 15 mm, > 15 to <= 20 mm, and > 25 to <= 30
   mm exhibited an increasing trend while rainfall ranges of > 5 to <= 10
   mm, > 20 to <= 25 mm, > 30 to <= 35 mm, and > 35 mm displayed a
   decreasing trend (p > 0.10). The jump test results indicate that only
   one jump occurred in the average rainfall ranges of > 15 to <= 20 mm (p
   < 0.10). The changes in temporal trends of different rainfall frequency
   ranges show an irregular pattern during the study period. The spatial
   map of trends among various rainfall ranges over sub-climatic regions is
   heterogeneous nature which varies from region wise and station wise. The
   probability density function (PDFs) of rainfall frequency ranges will
   move upward in the future and broaden with an increase in the
   forthcoming period. To adapt to climate change, the findings highlight
   the need for the advancement of water resource management and
   reallocation of agricultural adaptation plans in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {Drought is a recurring natural hazard, which has the potential to alter
   the ecological conditions of a region. A deficit in rainfall and a
   decrease in the number of rainy days induce the meteorological drought.
   The present study considered the nonparametric Mann-Kendall to
   investigate annual and seasonal rainfall (rainy-day) trend and
   meteorological drought trends over the Ghataprabha River Basin, India. A
   significant number of moderate and severe droughts were observed over
   the study period, and the eastern portion of the basin possessed the
   highest number of drought frequency (20-35 No.) in all the time scales
   of SPI. Results of trend analysis revealed that the stations having
   significant negative SPI trends are increasing with the SPI time scale,
   which could lead to the droughts of higher duration and severity. From
   the study, it was also noted that the negative trend of SPI was moving
   from the western portion of the basin to the eastern side, as the SPI
   time scale increases. Comparison between rainfall trend and rainy-day
   trend with SPI trend revealed high (ranging from 0.91 to 0.97) and
   moderate (0.67-0.7) correlation, respectively. This indicates that the
   rainfall trend will capture the SPI trends effectively. The findings of
   this work could be useful for a better understanding of regional drought
   trends and also establish effective water resources management policies
   over the basin.},

Abstract = {Rainfall plays an important role in the socio-economic development of
   any nation. Below or above normal rainfall amounts have serious
   consequences on key socio-economic sectors. This is particularly true
   for countries such as Ghana where rainfall plays a key role in the
   agriculture and energy sectors. In this study, the Climate Hazards Group
   InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS)-homogenized daily
   rainfall series was used to determine the variability of ten extreme
   rainfall indices recommended by the World Meteorological
   Organization-Commission for Climatology (WMO-CCL) and the research
   project on Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR). The trends
   of these indices and their links to SST anomalies at oceanic basins were
   also explored in this study. To understand the variability at
   interannual to decadal time scales and links with SST forcings, the sum
   of the first three principal components of the indices were correlated
   with SST anomalies at oceanic basins. The 35 years mean of frequency
   indices, CDD, CWD, R10mm and R20mm were found to be in a range of
   10-125, 6-14, 30-60 and 8-24 days per year, respectively. On the other
   hand, the mean over the same period of intensity indices PRCPTOT, R95p,
   R99p, SDII, RX1day and RX5day were in the range of 900-1700 mm, 200-400
   mm, 40-130 mm, 9-13 mm, 30-100 mm and 90-180 mm per year, respectively.
   The maximum of temporally averaged intensity indices covers southwestern
   Ghana, while the minimum of the indices lies over northwestern and
   eastern coasts. A significant decreasing trend in wet indices were
   observed over the Volta Lake and central portions of the country (7.5
   degrees N to 9.5 degrees N), whereas low positive trends were observed
   over the Northern parts of the country. Wet indices over the country
   showed significant positive correlations with the Atlantic Ocean SST and
   negative correlations with the Pacific and Indian basins SSTs.
   Specifically, the NINO3.4 revealed significant negative correlations
   with the wet indices over the west-central portions of the country. IOD
   was observed to have a dipole effect on rainfall indices with the
   central and southern parts generally covered by negative correlations,
   while Northern and coastal regions showed positive correlations. The

Abstract = {The main goals of this study are to better understand the spatial and
   temporal variabilities in rainfall and to identify rainfall trends and
   erosivity for the period from 1963 to 1991 in the Epitacio Pessoa
   reservoir catchment, which is located in Paraiba, northeastern Brazil.
   This study analyzes annual rainfall trends on a regional scale by using
   monthly data from 13 rainfall stations. For this purpose, the
   nonparametric Mann-Kendall and Sen methods were used in the analysis.
   Descriptive statistics methods and interpolation techniques were also
   used for spatial-temporal analysis of the annual rainfall. A detailed
   statistical analysis applied to the time series of all the stations
   indicates that the rainfall presents substantial annual spatial-temporal
   variability and a negative trend (decrease) in the mean rainfall at most
   of the rainfall stations in the catchment during the study period. The
   results only showed a positive trend for the Soledade and Pocinhos
   stations. The distribution of positive and negative trends in the
   Epitacio Pessoa reservoir catchment is extremely irregular, and the
   changes in the study area are more significant compared to those
   identified in other studies.

Abstract = {Improved information on the distribution of seasonal rainfall is
   important for crop production in Ghana. The predictability of key
   agro-meteorological indices, namely, seasonal rainfall, maximum dry
   spell length (MDSL) and dry spell frequency (DSF) was investigated
   across Ghana (with an interest on the coastal savannah agro-ecological
   zone). These three variables are relevant for local agricultural water
   management. A dynamical model (i.e. European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 4 seasonal forecasts) and a statistical
   model (i.e. response to sea surface temperatures (SSTs)) were used and
   analysed using correlation and other discrimination skill metrics.
   ECMWF-System 4 was bias-corrected and verified with 14 local stations'
   observations. Results show that differences in variability and skills of
   the agro-meteorological indices are small between agro-ecological zones
   as compared to the differences between stations. The dynamic model
   System 4 explains up to 31\% of the variability of the MDSL and seasonal
   rainfall indices. Coastal savannah exhibits the highest level of
   discrimination skills. However, these skills are generally higher for
   the below and above normal MDSL and seasonal rainfall categories at lead
   time 0. Similarity in skills for the agro-meteorological indices over
   the same zones and stations is found both for the dynamical and
   statistical models. Although System 4 performs slightly better than the
   statistical model, especially, for dry spell length and seasonal
   rainfall. For dry spell frequency and longer lead time dry spell length,
   the statistical model tends to perform better. These results suggest
   that the agro-meteorological indices derived from System 4 ` updated
   versions, corrected with local observations, together with the response
   to SST information, can potentially support decision-making of local
   smallholder farmers in Ghana.},

Abstract = {Since the dawn of civilization, the Western Mediterranean region has
   been a unique path for encounters and exchanges. The stability of the
   general conditions prevailing in its surrounding was crucial to ensure
   this vital link between north and south and east and west. However, any
   imbalance would be the precursor of a harmful domino effect to these
   environments, where the natural vulnerabilities are combined to a
   worsening socioeconomic congestion. In both banks, efforts are made not
   to give way to the fragile balance of water availability and risks.
   Here, we show that the amount and recurrence of extreme rainfall events
   contradict with current management scenarios. Our pixel-based assessment
   of the rain components extracted from the African Rainfall Climatology
   product reveals an annual increase in the total amount of rainfall and
   extreme rainfall events. A spatial and a trend analysis of the studied
   rainfall components were carried out to determine their spatial patterns
   and magnitude. The cumulative annual rainfall alone will not mean if a
   year is dry or wet. A wet year can experience great periods of drought,
   which will have serious repercussions on the socioeconomic and
   ecological levels. In addition, the increased occurrence of extreme
   rains can produce floods, intensifying land degradation processes, loss
   of biodiversity, water availability and economic growth. Decision-makers
   should be aware that current models of territorial management will not
   be able to cope with this change and that interdisciplinary cohesion and
   cross-border actions are the most appropriate solution.

Title = {Analyzing Trend and Variability of Rainfall in The Tafna Basin
   (Northwestern Algeria)},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Northwest Algeria has experienced fluctuations in rainfall between the
   two decades 1940s and 1990s from positive to negative anomalies, which
   reflected a significant decline in rainfall during the mid-1970s.
   Therefore, further analyzing rainfall in this region is required for
   improving the strategies on water resource management. In this study, we
   complement previous studies by dealing with sub basins that were not
   previously addressed in Tafna basin (our study area located in Northwest
   Algeria), and by including additional statistical methods (Kruskal
   Wallis test, Jonckheere-Terpstra test, and the Friedman test) that were
   not earlier reported on the large scale (Northwest Algeria). In order to
   analyse the homogeneity, trends, and stationarity in rainfall time
   series for nine rainfall stations over the period 1979-2011, we have
   used several statistical tests. The results showed an increasing trend
   for annual rainfall after the break detected in 2007 for Djbel Chouachi,
   Ouled Mimoun, Sidi Benkhala stations using Hubert, Pettitt, and Buishand
   tests. The Lee and Heghinian test has detected a break at the same year
   in 2007 for all stations except Sebdou, Beni Bandel, and Hennaya
   stations, which have a break date in 1980. We have confirmed this
   increasing trend for rainfall with other trend detection methods such as
   Mann Kendall and Sen's method that highlighted an upward trend for all
   the stations in the autumn season, which is mainly due to an increase in
   rainfall in September and October. On a monthly scale, the date of
   rupture is different from one station to another because the time series
   are not homogeneous. In addition, we have applied three tests enabling
   further results: (i) the Jonckheere-Terpstra test has detected an upward
   trend for two stations (Khemis and Hennaya), (ii) Friedman test has
   indicated the difference between the mean rank again with Khemis and
   Hennaya stations and the Merbeh station, (iii) according to the
   Kruskal-Wallis test, there have been no variance detected between all
   the rainfall stations. The increasing trend in rainfall may lead to a
   rise in stream flow and enhance potential floods risks in low-lying
   regions of the study area.},

Abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to investigate the spatiotemporal
   variability and trends in rainfall extremes in Enebsie Sar Midir
   district, northwest Ethiopia, based on the data obtained from National
   Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia. Mann-Kendall's test and Sen's slope
   estimator were used to analyze the trend and magnitude of change,
   respectively. The results revealed that the annual rainfall showed
   increasing trend at all stations except at Mertu Lemariam, but the
   trends were not statistically significant. Trends of extreme rainfall
   events did not show systematic pattern. The maximum 1 day (Rx1 day)
   precipitation value decreased at Gundowoin, while the values increased
   at Mertu Lemariam and Motta. The trends for the mean annual consecutive
   5 days (Rx5 day) precipitation, mean annual heavy (R10 mm) precipitation
   and mean annual very heavy (R20 mm) precipitation for annual time series
   were decreasing at Mertu Lemariam, while the trends were increasing at
   Gundowoin. The mean annual wet day rainfall intensity (SDII) for both
   the annual and main rainy seasons' time series showed increasing trends
   but not statistically significant. The mean annual number of wet days,
   the mean annual consecutive wet days and the mean annual consecutive dry
   days at Gundowoin for both the annual and the main rainy seasons' time
   series showed increasing trends, but the trend was only statistically
   significant for during the annual time series. The study has paramount
   significance for small-holder farmers to design appropriate adaptive
   strategies to climate-induced risks.},

   Trends in the annual air temperature and probability of precipitation
   phases for various long-term periods are discussed and differences in
   the mean air temperature and probability of precipitation phases between
   1979-97 (insignificant warming) and 1999-2017 (significant warming) on
   an intra-annual scale. In the studied region, the precipitation phases
   were sensitive to warming and atmospheric circulation to various
   degrees, depending on the phase, mean climate, month, and local
   conditions. The probability of days with rainfall increased (by +1\% to
   +3\% per decade), whereas the probability of days with snowfall
   decreased (by -1.5\% to -2.4\% per decade). The increasing trends in the
   probability of rainy days at all stations and decreasing trends in the
   probability of snowy days in the southern part of the region were
   warming induced. The most significant and widespread trends in snowy and
   rainy days were found in September. The probability of days with mixed
   precipitation exhibited no trends due to an inverse reaction to warming
   in the warmer and colder parts of the year. Temporal variability in the
   probability of precipitation phases was significantly linked to three
   teleconnection patterns playing a role in various parts of the year.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis has become one of the most important issues in
   hydro-meteorological variables study due to climate change and the focus
   given to it in the recent past from the scientific community. In this
   study, long-term trends of rainfall are analyzed in eight stations
   located in semi-arid central Gujarat region, India by considering time
   series data of 116 years (1901-2016). Discrete wavelet transform (DWT)
   as a dyadic arrangement of continuous wavelet transformation combined
   with the widely applied and acknowledged Mann-Kendall (MK) trend
   analysis method were applied for analysis of trend and dominant
   periodicities in rainfall time series at monthly, annual and monsoonal
   time scales. Initially, rainfall time series applied in this study were
   decomposed using DWT to generate sub-time series at high and low
   frequencies, before applying the MK trend test. Further, the Sequential
   Mann-Kendall (SQMK) test was also applied to find out the trend changing
   points. The result showed that at the monthly annual and monsoon time
   scales, the trends in rainfall were significantly decreasing in most of
   the station. The 4-month and 8-month components were found as dominant
   at the monthly time series and the 2-year and 4-year component were
   found as dominant at the monsoon time series, whereas the 2-year
   components were observed as dominant in the annual time scale.},

Title = {Long-Term Rainfall Trends and Future Projections over Xijiang River
   Basin, China},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Precipitation trend detection is vital for water resources development
   and decision support systems. This study predicts the climate change
   impacts on long-term precipitation trends. It deals with the analysis of
   observed historical (1960-2010) and arithmetic mean method in assembling
   precipitation from CMIP5 Global Climate Models (GCMs) datasets for a
   future period (2020-2099) under four emission scenarios. Daily
   precipitation data of 32 weather stations in the Xijiang River Basin
   were provided by National Meteorological Information Centre (NMIC) of
   the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Global Climate Models
   (GCMs) with all four emission scenarios statistically downscaled using
   Bias Correction Special Disaggregation (BCSD) and applied for bias
   correction via Climate Change Toolkit (CCT). Nonparametric Mann-Kendall
   test was applied for statistical significance trend analysis while the
   magnitude of the trends was determined by nonparametric Sen's estimator
   method on a monthly scale to detect monotonic trends in annual and
   seasonal precipitation time series. The results showed a declined trend
   was observed for the past 50 years over the basin with negative values
   of MK test (Z) and Sen's slope Q. Historical GCMs precipitation detected
   decreasing trends except for NoerESM1-M which observed slightly
   increasing trends. The results are further validated by historical
   precipitation recorded by the Climate Research Unit (CRU-TS-3.1). The
   future scenarios will likely be positive trends for annual rainfall.
   Significant positive trends were observed in monsoon and winter seasons
   while premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons will likely be slightly
   downward trends. The 2040s will likely observe the lowest increase of
   6.6\% while the 2050s will observe the highest increase of 11.5\% over
   the 21(st) century under future scenarios. However, due to the
   uncertainties in CMIP5, the future precipitation projections should be
   interpreted with caution. Thus, it could be concluded that the trend of
   change in precipitation around the Xijiang River Basin is on the
   increase under future scenarios. The results can be valuable to water
   resources and agriculture management policies, as well as the approach
   for managing floods and droughts under the perspective of global climate
   change.},

Abstract = {The present study aims to identify the long term spatial and temporal
   distribution of rainfall, using the methods from GIS and statistical
   tools, in Lower Bhavani basin. For this attempt, the spatial
   distribution of rainfall pattern was studied, by using 33 years of
   rainfall data (1983 - 2015), from 22 rain gauge stations. The rainfall
   pattern was interpolated by Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method using
   Arc GIS 10.2.1 on the monthly, seasonal and annual basis. The mean
   annual rainfall of the region was 666.84 mm. The increasing monthly
   rainfall was reported in the month of October (164 mm) and decreasing
   rainfall was observed in the month of January (4.99 mm). The seasonal
   rainfall changes were prominent during the north east Monsoon season.
   From 1983 to 2015, 2010 witnessed the highest rainfall pattern in the
   area. The statistical analysis of Mann Kendall (MK) Test was used, to
   detect the monotonic increasing and decreasing trend over time, on a
   monthly basis. A significant level (alpha = 0.05) was used to detect the
   positive and negative trend that existed over the basin. To be precise,
   the positive trend existed during the October over 10 rain gauge
   stations and it was located on the upper northern part of the basin. The
   negative trend was observed, over six rain gauge stations in southern
   part of the basin, in the month of January. The result indicated that
   spatial distribution of rainfall and trend pattern ensured influences in
   the topography, agriculture productivity and groundwater management
   across the basin.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Investigation of trends and variability in rainfall patterns is of
   paramount importance for the effective planning and management of
   rainfed cropping systems. In this study, a detailed analysis is carried
   out to understand the changes in rainfall patterns and characteristics
   at a regional scale on agro-climatic zone basis, in the mid-Mahanadi
   river basin. Daily rainfall data of India Meteorological Department
   (IMD) at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution has been
   analyzed for the period of 1979-2013 on a monthly, seasonal, and annual
   timescale to investigate variability, trends, and seasonality of
   rainfall. Results of analysis reveal that there is large spatio-temporal
   variation in the river basin with a shift in seasonality of rainfall,
   with increased prolonged dry spells, and significant increase in extreme
   weather events over the agro-climatic zones (AZ). Most of the
   agro-climatic zones are found to have significant decreasing trends in
   the magnitude of rainfall during the non-monsoon season. In particular,
   agro-climatic zones nearer to the coastal region are more vulnerable to
   the high rainfall, whereas the North-Eastern-Ghat (AZ67) and
   Western-Central-Table (AZ68) regions are susceptible to the moisture
   stress. Further, analysis of groundwater level fluctuation shows a
   significant decline in groundwater level during the monsoon as well as
   non-monsoon seasons. The resulted effect of rainfall variability can be
   seen in terms of an increase in the prolonged dry spells as well as
   decline in the groundwater level. Moreover, the results of this study
   indicate a climate change signal at the regional scale that will help
   the policymakers and water managers to identify the critical
   agro-climatic zones in the mid-Mahanadi river basin for the formulation
   of efficient water resources management and planning strategies,
   particularly for the major crops of the rainfed agriculture regions.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the spatio-statistical analysis of rainfall
   fluctuation, anomaly and trend in the Hindu Kush region using
   auto-regressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) approach. In the
   study area, trend in rainfall has significant impact on fluctuations in
   river discharge, which ultimately led to floods and hydrological
   drought. In this study, rainfall has been used as a climatic parameter.
   For this study, average annual and mean monthly rainfall data for Dir,
   Timergara, Saidu, Chitral, Drosh, Malam Jabba and Kalam meteorological
   stations located in the study region were gathered from Regional
   Meteorological Center Peshawar. In the study area, the rainfall is
   mostly received during two prominent periods, i.e., summer rainfall from
   monsoon, whereas winter and spring rainfall from western depressions. In
   the study area, Malam Jabba has recorded the heavy mean annual rainfall
   (1647 mm) and is considered as the humid station followed by met station
   Dir with a 1362 mm mean annual rainfall. Similarly, Saidu met station
   received 1050 mm mean annual rainfall and Kalam 1038 mm, whereas
   Timergara, Drosh and Chitral recorded 796 mm, 568 mm and 458 mm,
   respectively. The temporal data regarding rainfall were calculated and
   simulated in Addinsoft Excel state 2014 by applying ARIMA statistical
   model for trend prediction, fluctuations and anomaly. The analysis
   indicates that in terms of rainfall, an increasing trend has been
   detected at Dir, Chitral, Saidu and Kalam meteorological stations,
   whereas a declining trend has been recorded at Timergara, Drosh and
   Malam Jabba meteorological stations. In terms of rainfall anomaly, the
   met station Dir has indicated comparatively high positive anomaly.
   Contrary to this, the met stations of Saidu and Drosh have experienced
   negative rainfall anomaly.},

Abstract = {Our paper reviews recent progress in the study and understanding of
   observed trends in extreme rainfall events in the Metropolitan Area of
   Sao Paulo (MASP). These are discussed in relation to hydrometeorological
   hazards that trigger natural disasters, such as flash floods,
   landslides, and droughts, that affect the population and local
   economies. A review of the most updated literature on rainfall and
   extremes in the MASP shows a significant increase in the total volume of
   rainy-season rainfall during the last seven decades. While there were
   practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s,
   these days have been occurring two to five times a year in the last 10
   years. This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas,
   such as slopes and banks of watercourses, leads to inundation, flooding,
   and landslides. Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate
   variability but can also be related to global warming and/or
   urbanization. There is ample evidence of an increasing risk of
   rainfall-related hazards in the MASP. This is particularly so for
   landslides in vulnerable areas. Exposure will continue to lead to risk
   increases. This calls for significant improvement in climate and
   disaster risk reduction and management efforts in the MASP region.},

Title = {An Analysis of Long-Term Rainfall Trends and Variability in the
   Uttarakhand Himalaya Using Google Earth Engine},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper analyses the spatio-temporal trends and variability in
   annual, seasonal, and monthly rainfall with corresponding rainy days in
   Bhilangana river basin, Uttarakhand Himalaya, based on stations and two
   gridded products. Station-based monthly rainfall and rainy days data
   were obtained from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for the
   period from 1983 to 2008 and applied, along with two daily rainfall
   gridded products to establish temporal changes and spatial associations
   in the study area. Due to the lack of more recent ground station
   rainfall measurements for the basin, gridded data were then used to
   establish monthly rainfall spatio-temporal trends for the period 2009 to
   2018. The study shows all surface observatories in the catchment
   experienced an annual decreasing trend in rainfall over the 1983 to 2008
   period, averaging 15.75 mm per decade. Analysis of at the monthly and
   seasonal trend showed reduced rainfall for August and during monsoon
   season as a whole (10.13 and 11.38 mm per decade, respectively); maximum
   changes were observed in both monsoon and winter months. Gridded
   rainfall data were obtained from the Climate Hazard Infrared Group
   Precipitation Station (CHIRPS) and Precipitation Estimation from
   Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate
   Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR). By combining the big data analytical
   potential of Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compare spatial patterns and
   temporal trends in observational and modelled precipitation and
   demonstrate that remote sensing products can reliably be used in
   inaccessible areas where observational data are scarce and/or temporally
   incomplete. CHIRPS reanalysis data indicate that there are in fact three
   significantly distinct annual rainfall periods in the basin, viz. phase
   1: 1983 to 1997 (relatively high annual rainfall); phase 2: 1998 to 2008
   (drought); phase 3: 2009 to 2018 (return to relatively high annual
   rainfall again). By comparison, PERSIANN-CDR data show reduced annual
   and winter precipitation, but no significant changes during the monsoon
   and pre-monsoon seasons from 1983 to 2008. The major conclusions of this
   study are that rainfall modelled using CHIRPS corresponds well with the
   observational record in confirming the decreased annual and seasonal
   rainfall, averaging 10.9 and 7.9 mm per decade respectively between 1983
   and 2008, although there is a trend (albeit not statistically
   significant) to higher rainfall after the marked dry period between 1998
   and 2008. Long-term variability in rainfall in the Bhilangana river
   basin has had critical impacts on the environment arising from water
   scarcity in this mountainous region.},

Title = {Spatial Distribution and Temporal Trends of Rainfall Erosivity in Three
   Gorges Reservoir Area of China},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Rainfall erosivity is a key factor to predict soil erosion rate in
   universal soil loss equation (USLE) and revised USLE (RUSLE).
   Understanding rainfall erosivity characteristics, especially its spatial
   distribution and temporal trends, is essential for soil erosion risk
   assessment and soil conservation planning. In this study, the
   spatial-temporal variation of rainfall erosivity in the Three Gorges
   Reservoir Area (TGRA) of China during 1960-2010, at annual and seasonal
   scales, was explored based on daily rainfall data from 40 stations (26
   meteorological stations and 14 hydrologic stations). The Mann-Kendall
   test and Co-kriging interpolation method were applied to detect the
   temporal trends and spatial patterns. The results showed that TGRA's
   annual rainfall erosivity increased from west, south, and east to the
   north-central, ranging from 3647.0 to 10884.8 MJ center dot mm center
   dot ha(-1)center dot h(-1) with an average value of 6108.1 MJ center dot
   mm center dot ha(-1)center dot h(-1). The spatial distribution of summer
   and autumn rainfall erosivity was similar to the pattern of annual
   rainfall erosivity. Summer is the most erosive season among four
   seasons, accounting for 53\% of the total annual rainfall erosivity, and
   winter is the least erosive season. July is the most erosive month with
   an average of 1327.3 MJ center dot mm center dot ha(-1)center dot h(-1),
   and January is the least erosive month. Mean rainfall erosivity was
   5969.2 MJ center dot mm center dot ha(-1)center dot h(-1) during
   1960-2010, with the lowest value of 3361.0 MJ center dot mm center dot
   ha(-1)center dot h(-1) in 1966 and highest value of 8896.0 MJ center dot
   mm center dot ha(-1)center dot h(-1) in 1982. Mann-Kendall test showed
   that the annual rainfall erosivity did not change significantly across
   TGRA. Seasonal rainfall erosivity showed a significant decrease in
   autumn and insignificant decrease in summer and winter. Monthly rainfall
   erosivity in TGRA showed insignificant increases from Jun to Jul and
   then underwent decreases from Aug to Nov. and from Dec to Feb and it
   rose again in Feb reaching a 0.01 level significance. The daily rainfall
   data of supplemental stations is very useful to interpolate rainfall
   erosivity map, which could help to find the credible maximum and minimum
   value of TGRA. In total, the findings could provide useful information
   both for soil erosion prediction, land management practices, and
   sediment control project of TGRA.},

Title = {The MJO's impact on rainfall trends over the Congo rainforest},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2020},

Number = {5-6},

Abstract = {A significant declining trend in rainfall over the Congo basin has been
   observed over the past three decades. Since the Madden-Julian
   oscillation (MJO) is a major forcing mechanism for tropical convection
   and rainfall, the interannual variability and trend in rainfall over the
   Congo may be partly attributable to variability or changes in the MJO.
   This study explores the long-term (1979-2018) relationship between the
   active MJO diagnosed by the real-time multivariate (RMM) MJO phase index
   data and observed rainfall and cloud data over the Congo during
   October-March. Since the MJO may significantly enhance rainfall during
   the wet phases or suppress rainfall during the dry phases, the crux of
   this paper includes how trends in MJO activity may impact the overall
   observed precipitation trend over the Congo. The relationship between
   MJO activity and rainfall over the Congo was documented using
   statistical techniques and composite analysis. A new, yet simple
   approach was developed to partition seasonal rainfall depending on the
   MJO phase (i.e., wet, dry, inactive, and other). Results show a
   significant correlation between the number of wet and dry MJO days, and
   rainfall enhancement and suppression over the Congo. While there exists
   considerable interannual variability in MJO activity and rainfall over
   the Congo, there is a significant increase in the number of dry MJO days
   (3.47 days decade(-1)) which tends to intensify the large-scale drying
   trend over the Congo during October-March. The increasing trend in the
   number of dry MJO days is likely enhancing the net drying trend by
   13.6\% over the Congo.},

Title = {Why the Increasing Trend of Summer Rainfall over North China Has Halted
   since the Mid-1990s},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Previous studies indicate that the summer (July-August) rainfall over
   North China has decreased since the mid-1970s due to the weakening of
   East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). However, this study firstly discovers
   the new evidences that the summer rainfall over North China had a
   significant increasing tendency during 1979-1996; since 1997, this
   increasing tendency has halted while more summer droughts occurred over
   North China. One important cause for the halted increasing tendency over
   North China is the interdecadal decrease of the westerly water vapor
   transport during 1997-2016 in addition to the weakened EASM. The
   decrease of the westerly water vapor transport during 1997-2016 was due
   to the interdecadal warming over Lake Baikal. The interdecadal warming
   in the upper troposphere at 200 hPa forced the weakening of the
   upper-level zonal winds since 1997, which resulted in the anomalous
   descending flow over the north side of North China and the halted
   precipitation trend in North China.},

Abstract = {The June rainfall over the Korean peninsula has exhibited a significant
   decrease in particular after late 1990s. From the Empirical Orthogonal
   Function (EOF) analyses on the surface temperature, this study found two
   modes to be closely related to the decrease of rainfall over the
   peninsula. The first (second) EOF mode is associated with the enhanced
   surface temperature and anticyclonic circulation over the eastern Lake
   Baikal to northeastern China (the far East of Russia). The second mode
   also appears to be related to the cyclonic circulation over the East
   China Sea and south of Japan islands. These circulation patterns induce
   southeastward or eastward water vapor transports, and then contribute to
   the decreased moisture flux convergence and rainfall over Korea. In
   conclusion, the recent decrease of June rainfall over the Korean
   peninsula is thought to be, in part, associated with changes in the East
   Asian Summer Monsoon circulation possibly caused by the local warming
   trends over the eastern Lake Baikal to Mongolia and far East of Russia.},

   in all the study stations shows a decline, as indicated by several
   statistical methods: simple linear regression, seven-year moving
   averages, and T-test. The results also indicate a decline in the
   cultivated areas of wheat and barley due to the decline in autumn
   rainfall. The reduction of the wheat area resulted in an expansion of
   the barley area with the decrease in the annual and autumn rains. This
   decrease had a negative impact on the level of productivity of both
   crops. The year of drought during the study period was 1999, while 1987
   was the wettest, in which wheat and barley production reached its peak.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an investigation of the temporal rainfall variability in

   have been detected by means of the Mann-Kendall test and of a new
   graphical technique, Sen's method, which allows the trend identification
   of the low, medium, and high values of a series. As a result, different
   behaviors emerged in the South Island, with a rainfall increase in the
   southwest regions and a decrease in northeast areas. Moreover, the
   comparison of the trend methodologies has revealed different trend
   results (increasing, decreasing, or trendless time series). In
   particular, this study shows that Sen's method could be successfully
   used in the evaluation of peak and low values of data for the trend

Abstract = {This work approaches the study of rainfall events in Mediterranean
   environments. The area of study is that of the Jucar River Water
   Authority. More than 600 episodes have been selected (1989-2016) from
   the original five-minute rainfall information according to hydrological
   criteria. Episodes have been described by indicators of accumulated
   precipitation, intensity, and persistence. Through a cluster analysis,
   the episodes have been classified into three typologies (limited
   resources, long-term resources, and risky episodes). The temporal
   evolution of each event class has been analysed, establishing
   differences between the inland and coastal episodes. The results show a
   generalised trend towards increasing risk at the expense of decreased
   resources - due to less accumulated rainfall and an increase in
   intensities. Despite an increasing annual frequency of events, the
   significance of risk events is more important than those of resource
   events. This behaviour is more pronounced in the inland areas than on
   the coast. Moreover, a monthly shift in the event type occurrence is
   observed: events that contribute a great deal of rainfall are moving
   from October to November, favouring the monthly coincidence of high
   precipitation episodes and intense episodes. This synergy between
   copious and intense events is an added risk factor.},

Abstract = {The analysis of variability and trends of rainfall can be used to assist
   better decision for climate risk and agricultural water management. This
   study makes an attempt to evaluate the trend and variability of annual,
   seasonal and monthly rainfall of 19 stations of Ajmer district,
   Rajasthan based on 44 year's monthly rainfall data (1973-2016).
   Non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK), Modified Mann-Kendall (mMK) and
   Spearman's rho (SR) tests were used to achieve if there was an
   increasing or decreasing trend in the time series and the Sen's slope
   (Q) estimator was applied to identify the quantity of the trend. From
   the results, it was found that annual and monsoon rainfall both showed
   an increasing trend at three stations, located in the central part and a
   decreasing trend at two stations, located in the northwestern and
   south-western part of the study area. The magnitude of maximum
   increasing trends in both annual and monsoon rainfall was observed at
   Goela (Q = +10.17 mm/year and + 9.50 mm/year) while Jawaja (Q = -6.76
   mm/year and - 5.21 mm/year) appeared with the maximum decreasing trends.
   On a monthly scale February showed an increasing trend at maximum number
   of stations (seven) and July showed a decreasing trend at maximum number
   of stations (seven). The information gathered from our study will help
   in future to estimate hydraulic procedures as well as to make
   sustainable water resource planning and management in this region.},

Abstract = {Changes in rainfall pattern due to climate change have an impact on
   streamflow. Extreme rainfall has triggered an annual increase in
   flooding in the Upper Citarum River Basin. The present study, 18 years
   (1998-2016) of daily rainfall data at sixteen rain gauge stations was
   used to identify trends of the annual rainfall, annual maximum 24-h
   precipitation, and number of a rainy day at the Upper Citarum river
   basin, Indonesia. The non-parametric statistical test by Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test and the Sen's slope estimator were applied to assess the trend
   of data and the magnitude of the slope. According to the MK test (S
   value) that approximately 75\% of all station tend to increase for
   rainfall data. Meanwhile, related to Z value at a 95\% confidence level,
   the trend of annual rainfall was increasing significantly in Cipeusing
   and Cipaku/Paseh stations, while Cisondari station shows a decreasing
   trend. 50\% of the selected stations show a significant trend of the
   maximum daily rainfall, five stations namely Cicalengka, Cileunca,
   Rancaekek, Cipeusing, and Cipaku/Paseh stations tend to rise, while
   Cisondari and Lembang Meteo stations were reduced. Furthermore,
   Cipaku/Paseh station shows a significant upward trend for number of
   rainy day, in contrast with 15 stations, which indicate no significant
   trend of data.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of streamflow and its linkages to rainfall can facilitate
   the development of water resource management plans for watersheds. The
   present study focuses on trends in observed streamflow of the lower
   Tamiraparani river sub-basin in Tamilnadu, India using Mann - Kendall
   test and Sen's slope estimator for a period of 30 years. From this
   analysis, both the annual streamflow, annual rainfall increased very
   marginally at the rate of 0.1799 m(3)/s/year and 4.3741 mm/year,
   respectively. Similarly, in the northeast monsoon period, both the
   rainfall and streamflow were increased very minimally during the
   analysis period. However, the observations made during the southwest
   monsoon showed declining trends for most of the rainfall stations and no
   significant trend was observed for streamflow. The calculated Spearman's
   Rho correlation factor (rho) between rainfall and streamflow showed weak
   correlation during summer (0.26) and very strong correlation during
   northeast monsoon (0.83), strong correlation during southwest monsoon
   (0.53) and moderate correlation during winter (0.40). From this
   analysis, using Mann - Kendal test and Spearman's correlation it implies
   that other than precipitation and temperature, urbanization, watershed
   and ecological development of the catchment area could have also
   influenced the trends of streamflow.},

   rarely lasted more than a month in most parts of the Kemena and Tatau

   lasted for more than 3 months at two stations. In order to understand
   the impact of drought on local environments, spatial and temporal
   rainfall variability needs to be considered. Analysis of the heavy rainy
   period in these river basins indicates that the mechanism of rainfall is
   partly affected by the distance from the coastline.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the magnitude and significance of
   spatial-temporal trends of 37 years \& x2019; time series of the gridded
   data for rainfall, maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature for
   West Africa. A modified Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen \& x0027;s slope
   estimator were utilized to test the significance and the magnitude of
   trends, respectively. The magnitude of significant trends for three
   variables between six agroecological zones (AEZs) was compared. Gridded
   climate data represented gauge data with high accuracy and, therefore,
   can reliably complement the sparse observation network in West Africa.
   The three variables showed significant positive and negative trends of
   varying magnitude and spatial extent. June to September rainfall showed
   a positive increase (0.1 \& x2013;5 mm \& x002F;month \& x002F;year)
   that mostly occurred north of 11 \& x00B0; latitude. October rainfall
   showed a positive trend across the region, but the magnitude was higher
   south of the same latitude. A widespread significant warming trend was
   observed across all AEZs and months. However, a localized cooling in
   August and September over the Sahel and Sudan Savanna was an exception.
   The cooling over the two AEZs coincided with a positive trend of
   rainfall. The zonal analysis revealed that the magnitude of the positive
   trend of June, September, and October rain increased following a North
   \& x2013;South gradient from the Sahel to humid forest AEZs. Results
   provide spatial evidence of climate change in a limited data environment
   to guide the targeting of appropriate adaptation measures. The
   information generated from this article helps the design of early
   warning systems against droughts and floods.},

Abstract = {Urban communities in developing countries are one of the most vulnerable
   areas to extreme rainfall events. The availability of local information
   on extreme rainfall is therefore critical for proper planning and
   management of urban flooding impacts. This study examined the past and
   future characteristics of extreme rainfall in the urban catchments of
   Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Investigation of trends and frequency of
   annual, seasonal and extreme rainfall was conducted, with the period
   1967-2017 taken as the past scenario and 2018-2050 as the future
   scenario; using data from four key ground-based weather stations and RCM
   data respectively. Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Sen's slope estimator
   were used in studying changes in rainfall variability. Frequencies of
   extreme rainfall events were modeled using the Generalized Pareto model.
   Overall, the results of trend analysis provided evidence of a
   significant increase in annual and seasonal maximum rainfall and
   intensification of extreme rainfall in the future under the RCP4.5 CO2
   concentration scenario. It was determined that extreme rainfall will
   become more frequent in the future, and their intensities were observed
   to increase approximately between 20 and 25\% relative to the past. The
   findings of this study may help to develop adaptation strategies for
   urban flood control in Dar es Salaam.},

Abstract = {In order to detect areas and periods of rainfall reduction and increase
   in Parana State, south of Brazil, the objective of this manuscript is to
   analyze, spatially and temporally, rainfall trends from 1976 to 2011.
   Monthly data were collected on accumulated rainfall (mm) from 63
   pluviometric stations distributed throughout the study area. The data
   were grouped into quarterly (autumn, winter, spring, and summer),
   seasonal (dry and rainy season), and annual values. All values were
   evaluated for homogeneity and trends using the Mann-Whitney-Pettitt,
   Mann-Kendall, and linear regression tests. The results indicate a
   rainfall transition detected in the period 1991 to 1999, with a maximum
   change point in 1993. The trends indicate an average increase of 4.03 mm
   in the rainy season, mainly in the sectors that are predominately
   subtropical and coastal climates. These results corroborate in a better
   explanation rainfall patterns and variability in the tropical regions
   and the Southern Hemisphere, and imply a moderate process of rainfall
   tropicalization in the subtropical climate of Parana State.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to evaluate the homogeneity, trend, and
   trend change points in the rainfall data. Daily rainfall data was
   collected for the arid district of Ananthapuramu, Andhra Pradesh state,
   India from 1981 to 2016 at the subdistrict level and aggregated to
   monthly, annual, seasonal rainfall totals, and the number of rainy days.
   After quality checks and homogeneity analysis, a total of 27 rain gauge
   locations were considered for trend analysis. A serial correlation test
   was applied to all the time series to identify serially independent
   series. NonParametric Mann-Kendall test and Spearman's rank correlation
   tests were applied to serially independent series. The magnitude of the
   trend was calculated using Sen's slope method. For the data influenced
   by serial correlation, various modified versions of Mann-Kendall tests
   (pre-whitening, trend-free pre-whitening, bias-corrected pre-whitening,
   and two variants of variance correction approaches) were applied. A
   significant increasing summer rainfall trend is observed in six out of
   27 stations. Significant decreasing trends are observed at two stations
   during the southwest monsoon season and at two stations during the
   northeast monsoon season. To identify the trend change points in the
   time series, distribution-free cumulative sum test, and sequential
   Mann-Kendall tests were applied. Two open-source library packages were
   developed in R language namely, ``modifiedmk{''} and ``trendchange{''}
   to implement the statistical tests mentioned in this paper. The study
   results benefit water resource management, drought mitigation,
   socio-economic development, and sustainable agricultural planning in the
   region.},

Abstract = {Presence of long memory in climatic variables is frequently observed.
   The trend assessment becomes difficult in the presence of long-memory as
   the usual methods are not capable to take care of this property during
   trend estimation. In order to estimate the trend in presence of long
   memory, the non-parametric wavelet method has become popular in the
   recent time. The discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) re-expresses a
   time-series in terms of coefficients that are associated with a
   particular time and a particular scale. In the present study, DWT has
   been applied to estimate the monthly rainfall trend for the monsoon
   months: June-September in ten selected sub-divisions of India using
   ``Haar{''} wavelet filter. The results from DWT were cross checked with
   the non-parametric Mann-Kendall (M-K) test. The investigation reveals
   that the monthly rainfall trend for the monsoon months of different
   sub-divisions in India are significantly decreasing over the years.
   However, in some of the sub-divisions, rainfall trend is increasing. DWT
   reveals significant trend in most of the sub-divisions whereas M-K test
   reveals that most of the trends are not significant at 5\% level.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the analysis of monthly rainfall data for the
   period 1950-2016 for Mauritius using statistical techniques and
   decomposition method. For the statistical analysis, the data are fitted
   to commonly used probability distribution function for which parameters
   are estimated using the method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
   The Anderson-Darling (A-D), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and chi-square
   (C-S) tests are then employed to determine which PDF best fits the data.
   The results obtained indicate that the log-normal, GEV and inverse
   Gaussian PDFs best fit the rainfall data at less than 5\% significance
   level. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method is
   employed to study the trends in the data. Results obtained are in terms
   of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and the trendline. The analysis
   reveals that there is a general linear decrease of 1 mm/year in the
   amount of rainfall.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {231},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Trend detection in hydro-climatological time series is a prime task
   under the context of climate changes. Rainfall is a key component of the
   water cycle and its variability can profoundly influence agriculture,
   ecosystems and water resource management. In this paper, an innovative
   trend analysis (ITA) method with a significant test is used for rainfall
   trend detection at 14 stations in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) during
   1961-2016. The trends are separately evaluated for low (< 10th
   percentile), medium (10th-90th percentile) and high (> 90th percentile)
   rainfall at the annual and seasonal scales. The slope and significance
   of the rainfall trends derived from the ITA method are compared with
   those from the classical trend analysis methods Theil-Sen approach and
   Mann-Kendall test, respectively. The ITA shows significant increasing
   trends at the 99\% confidence level in annual rainfall at all stations.
   While the same significant increasing trends are identified for summer
   and winter, decreasing trends dominate in spring and autumn. Contrasting
   trends are found for extreme rainfall with strong increasing trends in
   high rainfall in summer and winter and decreasing trends in low rainfall
   in spring and autumn. The results of the ITA confirmed by the classical
   trend analysis methods call for more attention to the risk management of
   flood in extreme seasons and drought in transitional seasons across the
   YRD region.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis is important to understand effects of climate change and
   variability on rainfalls. In this study, rainfall and heavy rainfall
   trend analysis were performed for Sharjah City, UAE. Moreover, rainfall
   intensity-frequency duration (IFD) relationship was studied by fitting
   heavy rainfall data to extreme value distributions. Mostly decreasing
   rainfall trends were detected for short storm durations, whereas
   statistically non-significant rainfall trends were detected for long
   storm durations. Also, statistically non-significant increasing trends
   were detected in heavy rainfalls in Sharjah City. Heavy rainfall data
   sets were fit successfully to extreme value distributions, and rainfall
   IFD relationship was created for Sharjah City. Despite the availability
   of limited data for study area, this study contributed to better
   understanding of variations in rainfall and heavy rainfalls in Sharjah
   City. Moreover, derived rainfall IFD relationships by frequency analysis
   of generated heavy rainfalls provide significant input for water
   infrastructure projects in Sharjah City.},

Abstract = {Groundwaters host highly adapted fauna, known as stygofauna, which play
   a key role in maintaining the functional integrity of subterranean
   ecosystems. Stygofaunal niche studies provide insights into the
   ecological dynamics shaping the delicate balance between the
   hydrological conditions and community diversity patterns. This work aims
   to unravel the ecological trends of a calcrete stygofaunal community,
   with special focus on niche dynamics through the Outlying Mean Index
   analysis (OMI) and additional calculation of Within Outlying Mean
   Indexes (WitOMI), under three rainfall regimes. Temperature and pH
   changed significantly among different rainfall conditions (P < .001),
   and together with salinity were the most influential drivers in shaping
   stygofaunal assemblages. These environmental conditions, linked with
   nutrient fluctuations in the groundwater, constrained changes in niche
   occupation for water mites, two species of beetles and juvenile
   amphipods (OMI analysis, P < .05). The WitOMI analysis revealed
   differential subniche breadths linked with taxa-specific adaptations
   after different rainfall conditions. Our results indicate that
   stygofaunal niches are closely linked to the hydrodynamic conditions
   influenced by different rainfall regimes. Further long-term
   investigations, incorporating broader ecological perspectives, will help
   to understand the impacts associated with climate change and
   anthropogenic pressures on one of the most threatened ecosystems in the
   world.},

   climate change of a region. This study investigates trends in annual and
   seasonal rainfall over Sri Lanka using an Innovative Trend Analysis
   (ITA) and Mann-Kendall (MK) test with Sen's slope estimator. The MK test
   showed increasing trends in annual rainfall at 24 stations (65\%) with
   five stations showing significant increasing trend. Annual rainfall at
   13 locations (35\%) showed decreasing trend, but none were significant
   (p < .05). ITA results for annual rainfall showed increasing trend at
   67\% stations while 33\% stations showed decreasing trend. MK test
   results for seasonal rainfall indicated increasing trend at 76, 51, 32,
   and 86\% of stations during First Inter-Monsoon (FIM), Second
   Inter-Monsoon (SIM), South West Monsoon (SWM), and North East Monsoon
   (NEM) seasons, respectively. Seasonal analysis of rainfall trend using
   ITA method showed increasing trend in 81, 70, 32, and 65\% stations
   during FIM, SIM, SWM, and NEM, respectively. ITA and MK tests exhibited
   similar trend results for 80\% of the stations. Moreover, Spearman's rho
   correlation coefficient between ITA and MK test trends showed
   significant (p < .05) positive correlation. In general, eastern, south
   eastern, north and north central regions of the country showed
   increasing rainfall trend over the last 31 years (1987-2017) while
   western, part of north western and central part of the country indicated
   a decreasing rainfall trend during the same period.},

Abstract = {This contribution aims to investigate the influence of monthly total
   rainfall variations on malaria transmission in the Limpopo Province. For
   this purpose, monthly total rainfall was interpolated from daily
   rainfall data from weather stations. Annual and seasonal trends, as well
   as cross-correlation analyses, were performed on time series of monthly
   total rainfall and monthly malaria cases in five districts of Limpopo
   Province for the period of 1998 to 2017. The time series analysis
   indicated that an average of 629.5 mm of rainfall was received over the
   period of study. The rainfall has an annual variation of about 0.46\%.
   Rainfall amount varied within the five districts, with the northeastern
   part receiving more rainfall. Spearman's correlation analysis indicated
   that the total monthly rainfall with one to two months lagged effect is
   significant in malaria transmission across all the districts. The
   strongest correlation was noticed in Vhembe (r = 0.54; p-value =
   <0.001), Mopani (r = 0.53; p-value = <0.001), Waterberg (r = 0.40;
   p-value =< 0.001), Capricorn (r = 0.37; p-value = <0.001) and lowest in
   Sekhukhune (r = 0.36; p-value = <0.001). Seasonally, the results
   indicated that about 68\% variation in malaria cases in summer-December,
   January, and February (DJF)-can be explained by spring-September,
   October, and November (SON)-rainfall in Vhembe district. Both annual and
   seasonal analyses indicated that there is variation in the effect of
   rainfall on malaria across the districts and it is seasonally dependent.
   Understanding the dynamics of climatic variables annually and seasonally
   is essential in providing answers to malaria transmission among other
   factors, particularly with respect to the abrupt spikes of the disease
   in the province.},

Abstract = {With the increase of population, many cities are growing in size at a
   phenomenal rate. Urbanization changes the urban underlying surface,
   influences the micro-climate, and sometimes affects the local
   precipitation process. In this study, we investigated the trends of
   extreme rainfall in China's 21 typical urban areas. Based on a series of
   daily rainfall and ``Urban/built-up{''} dataset from TMPA 3B42 and
   MCD12Q1 products in China, trends in extreme precipitation, with the
   threshold defined as 95th (pre95p) and 99th (pre99p) percentiles of
   annual rain days during 1998-2015, have been assessed in China, and
   especially in 21 typical urban areas from 1998 to 2015. The tendency
   curves in extreme rainfall of different years are presented. In this
   period, more than 66\% regions of China covered by TMPA 3B42 have
   increasing trends in extreme rainfall with pre95p threshold. The 21
   typical urban areas showed different trends-in over half of these areas,
   upward tendencies in extreme rainfall were observed, particularly in
   Dalian, Beijing, and Chongqing. Seventeen urban areas showed increasing
   tendencies in pre95p extreme rainfall days, including Shanghai, Nanjing,
   Hangzhou, and Suzhou in the Yangtze River Delta region. The results also
   illustrate that southeastern coastal urban areas of China may have
   experienced decreasing occurrences in extreme rainfall.},

Title = {Analysis of spatio-temporal rainfall trends across southern African

Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Southern African biomes experience significant changes in the
   distribution of rainfall that are linked to El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation. As such, an understanding of the spatio-temporal rainfall
   trends is key in predicting rainfall patterns as well as validation of
   climate change projections. Currently, the available information on
   rainfall trends in southern Africa is scanty with most studies focusing
   either on the spatial or the temporal dimension at localised levels. The
   novelty of this study is its regional aspect (i.e. all of southern
   African arid and semi-arid biomes) and the simultaneous integration of
   space and time in rainfall trend analysis through the use of space time
   rainfall cube. In this study, we simultaneously examined spatial and
   temporal rainfall trends based on the space-time rainfall cube derived
   from 1981 to 2016 CHIRPS satellite rainfall data. The space time
   rainfall trend analysis revealed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease of
   rainfall across most biomes particularly in the northern parts of the
   savanna biome and southwestern biomes (i.e. karoo, desert and fynbos).
   Statistically significant (P < 0.05) rainfall increase was observed in
   the central parts of the region mostly within the savanna biome. In
   terms of the magnitude of rainfall change, some of the areas experienced
   as much as 12 mm rainfall decrease in the mean annual rainfall while
   others recorded an increase of 14 mm. Our results provide baseline
   information for climate change adaptation and ecosystem conservation.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Extreme climate events, either being linked to dry spells or extreme
   precipitation, are of major concern in Africa, a region in which the
   economy and population are highly vulnerable to climate hazards.
   However, recent trends in climate events are not often documented in
   this poorly surveyed continent. This study makes use of a large set of
   daily rain gauge data covering Southern West Africa (extending from 10
   degrees W to 10 degrees E and from 4 degrees N to 12 degrees N) from
   1950 to 2014. The evolution of the number and the intensity of daily
   rainfall events, especially the most extremes, were analyzed at the
   annual and seasonal scales. During the first rainy season (April-July),
   mean annual rainfall is observed to have a minor trend due to less
   frequent but more intense rainfall mainly along the coast of Southern
   West Africa (SWA) over the last two decades. The north-south seasonal
   changes exhibit an increase in mean annual rainfall over the last decade
   during the second rainy season (September-November) linked by both an
   increase in the frequency of occurrence of rainy days as well as an
   increase in the mean intensity and extreme events over the last decade.
   The study also provides evidence of a disparity that exists between the
   west and east of SWA, with the east recording a stronger increase in the
   mean intensity of wet days and extreme rainfall during the second rainy
   season (September-November).},

Abstract = {In this study, the recent changes in rainfall trend, prominent modes,
   and interannual variability of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) for
   the period 1980-2014 is investigated. Rainfall observations showed a
   decreasing trend during 1980-2000 (period 1) which changed to a
   significant increasing mode for the period 2001-2014 (period 2). The
   analysis shows that two prominent changes in the second period can
   induce the recent increasing trend of ISMR. The first one is the
   increased easterly wind anomalies from the equatorial Pacific associated
   with recent cooling in the eastern Pacific, and the second one is the
   increased cross-equatorial flow in the Indian Ocean as a result of
   increased land-sea thermal contrast. During the period 2, the dominant
   mode of ISMR variability increased and the connection with boundary
   forcing has intensified. The first mode of ISMR became strongly related
   to central and east Pacific SST (El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO))
   anomalies after 2000, while its relationship with major SST indices was
   weak before that. The second mode contributed to around 14\% of
   variability after the 2000s and is strongly related to Indian Ocean
   Dipole mode. These modes represent the interannual variability of ISMR
   during both the periods, and it increases considerably in the second
   period. Another significant difference between the two periods is that
   during period 1, many of the severe monsoon events are independent of
   ENSO; contrary during period 2, many were associated with that. Thus
   along with the significant change in trend, ISMR has stronger
   interannual variability, which is the prominent mode of Indian summer
   monsoon rainfall in the recent period.},

Number = {3-4},
Pages = {429-444},

Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that climate change is impacting not just
   total amounts of precipitation, but its temporal dynamics as well. While
   previous studies have identified the importance that the temporal
   distribution of daily rainfall has on crop production, climate models
   often do not represent these distributions consistently with observed
   trends. The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the
   relationship between rainfall variability and yields for economically
   important crops in the upper Southeastern United States and (2) assess
   the potential impact that incorporating observed trends in rainfall
   variability has on yield projections under future climate change. This
   study develops statistical models of historic crop yields for five
   crops, finding that an explanatory variable related to daily rainfall
   variability, the wet-day Gini coefficient (GC), has a statistically
   significant negative relationship with crop yields in all cases. These
   models are then used to estimate the impacts of climate change using an
   ensemble of downscaled general circulation model (GCM) projections and
   scenarios that include a continuation of observed GC trends. Most
   downscaled GCMs evaluated do not project changes in GC consistent with
   observed trends, and scenarios that assume a continuation of observed
   trends result in projected yields that are up to 5.8\% lower than those
   directly based on GCM projections. While additional research is needed
   in the climate science community to better understand how rainfall
   variability may change in the future, this should be mirrored in the
   impacts community so that agricultural impact assessments incorporate
   these potentially important changes.},

Abstract = {Drought causes serious social and environmental problems that have great
   impact on the lives of thousands of people all around the world. The
   purpose of this research was to investigate the trends in humid
   conditions in the northeast of Brazil (NEB) in the highest climatic
   precipitation quarters, November-December-January (NDJ),
   February-March-April (FMA), and May-June-July (MJJ), through the
   standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI),
   considering an alternative statistical approach. Precipitation and
   potential evapotranspiration (PET) time series for the calculation of
   the SPEI were extracted for the 1794 NEB municipalities between 1980 and
   2015 from a grid dataset with a resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25
   degrees using the bilinear interpolation method. The trends and
   statistical significance of the SPEI were estimated by quantile
   regression (QR) and the bootstrap test. In NDJ, opposite trends were
   seen in the eastern NEB (similar to 0.5 SPEI/decade) and in the south
   (similar to-0.6 SPEI/decade). In FMA, most of NEB presented negative
   trends in the 0.50 and 0.95 quantiles (similar to-0.3 SPEI/decade),
   while in MJJ, most of NEB presented positive trends in all quantiles
   studied (similar to 0.4 SPEI/decade). The results are consistent with
   observational analyses of extreme rainfall.},

Title = {The role of GRACE total water storage anomalies, streamflow and rainfall
   in stream salinity trends across Australia's Murray-Darling Basin during
   and post the Millennium Drought},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {83},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {By influencing water tables of saline aquifers, multiyear dry or wet
   periods can significantly delay or accelerate dryland salinity, but this
   effect remains poorly quantified at the large river basin scale. The
   Gravity and Climate Recovery Experiment (GRACE) satellite measures
   changes in the total water storage of river systems, providing a unique
   opportunity for better understanding connections between stream salinity
   and changes in catchment water storages at the large river basin scale.
   Here, we quantified the role of GRACE total water storage anomalies
   (TWSA) in stream salinity variability across Australia's Murray-Darling
   Basin ( similar to 1 million km(2)), while also accounting for
   streamflow and rainfall. We used the MERRA-2 global land surface model
   to i) place our findings in the context of the longer-term
   hydroclimatology (1980-present) and ii) to decompose TWSA into
   groundwater storage as an alternative driver variable. Multivariate time
   series regression models (generalized additive mixed models or GAMM)
   showed that the driver variables could explain 20-50\% of the
   variability in stream salinity across 8 sub-catchments in the Murray
   Darling Basin. TWSA commonly explained as much variability as stream
   flow, while groundwater storage and TWSA had very similar explanatory
   power and rainfall only negligible contributions. The 2000-2009
   Millennium Drought and the subsequent La Nina Floods had a predominantly
   decelerating and accelerating effect on stream salinity respectively and
   these trends were partially explained by trends in TWSA. Our study
   illustrates that GRACE can be a useful addition for monitoring and
   modeling dryland salinity over large river basins.},

Abstract = {In this study, an attempt has been made to analyze long-term annual and
   seasonal rainfall trends along with change point of annual rainfall in
   West Bengal, India for 102 years (1901 to 2002) using monthly rainfall
   data of 18 rainfall stations. The Mann-Kendall test is used to identify
   trend in rainfall time series and Theil-Sen's slope estimator to assess
   the magnitude of this trend. Trend-free pre-whitening method is used to
   eliminate the influence of significant lag-1 correlation from the
   series. Change in magnitude is derived in terms of percentage change
   over mean rainfall. Pettitt-Mann-Whitney and standard normal homogeneity
   test have been used to identify change point of annual rainfall. The
   results show that significant trend is found at five stations in annual
   rainfall, six stations in monsoon rainfall, and eight stations in
   postmonsoon rainfall. Maldah station has recorded highest negative
   change in magnitude in annual (-14\%) as well as monsoon rainfall
   (-20.48\%). South 24 Parganas rainfall station exhibits highest positive
   change in magnitude in annual (+13.98\%) and monsoon (+13.27\%)
   rainfall. Postmonsoon rainfall portrays positive change in magnitude at
   16 rainfall stations with highest change in Birbhum station (+40.07\%).
   Three most probable change point years of annual rainfall, viz. 1956,
   1967, and 1952 have been observed for the rainfall stations situated in
   northern, southern, and western part in West Bengal. In the post change
   point period, the number of rainfall stations with decreasing trend has
   risen in northern and western part whereas it has lessened in southern
   part.},

Title = {Quantile Regression Based Methods for Investigating Rainfall Trends
   Associated with Flooding and Drought Conditions},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {33},
Number = {12},

Abstract = {Conducting trend analysis of climatic variables is one of the key steps
   in many climate change impact studies where trend is often checked
   against aggregated variables. However, there is also a strong need to
   investigate the trend of the data in different regimes - examples
   include high flow versus low flow, and heavy precipitation versus
   prolonged dry period. For this matter, quantile regression (QR) based
   methods are preferred as they can reveal the temporal dependencies of
   the variable in question for not only the mean value, but also its
   quantiles. As such, the tendencies revealed by the QR methods are more
   informative and helpful in studies where different mitigation methods
   need to be considered at different severity levels.In this paper, we
   demonstrate the use of several quantile regressions methods to analyse
   the long-term trend of rainfall records in two climatically different
   regions: The Dee River catchment in the United Kingdom, for which daily
   rainfall data of 1970-2004 are available; and the Beijing Metropolitan
   Area in China for which monthly rainfall data from 1950 to 2012 are
   available. Two quantiles are used to represent heavy rainfall condition
   (0.98 quantile) and severe dry condition (0.02 quantile). The trends of
   these two quantiles are then estimated using linear quantile regression
   before being spatially interpolated to demonstrate their spatial
   distribution (for Dee river only). The method is also compared with
   traditional indices such as SPI. The results show that the quantile
   regression method can reveal patterns for both extremely wet and dry
   conditions of the areas. The clear difference between trends at the
   chosen quantiles manifests the utility of QR in this context.},

Title = {Rainfall Characteristics and Trends-and the Role of Congo Westerlies-in

Abstract = {While long-term rainfall trends and related atmospheric dynamics have
   been researched over the past several decades across equatorial Africa,
   little is known about rainfall in western Uganda, a transition zone in
   the middle of the continent. Using satellite-derived rainfall and
   reanalysis data from 1983 to 2017, this study examines atmospheric
   characteristics of seasons and multidecadal trends in rainfall. Most of
   the region has a biannual rainfall regime (i.e., the first rains within
   March-May and the second rains during August-November). Ascending
   (descending) air and increased (decreased) specific humidity are
   observed over western Uganda during the rainy (dry) seasons.
   Southeasterly air-parcel back trajectories are common throughout western
   Uganda at all times except for the first dry season (i.e.,
   December-February). For all seasons, wet days in western Uganda are
   characterized by increases in ascending air and specific humidity in
   addition to westerly flow anomalies. Wet days in most seasons also have
   a disproportionately high frequency of westerly back trajectories
   extending over the Congo Basin. These Congo westerlies are associated
   with more vertical ascent and a more humid middle troposphere compared
   to the other trajectories. Rainy seasons, especially the first rains,
   have gotten longer and wetter throughout western Uganda. The duration of
   the first rains increased by about 1 month over the 35 years; in turn,
   the rainfall total increased by approximately 70\%. Rainfall also has
   increased for climatological seasons, with the exception being
   December-February. Increases in middle-troposphere specific humidity and
   vertical ascent over time provide support for the wetting trends derived
   from the satellite-derived rainfall data.},

Title = {Investigation of Trends, Temporal Changes in
   Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curves and Extreme Rainfall Events
   Clustering at Regional Scale Using 5 min Rainfall Data},

Abstract = {High-frequency rainfall data is needed in different practical hydrologic
   applications, such as the construction of the
   intensity-duration-frequency curves (IDF). This paper presents an
   investigation of trends (station-wise and regional) for several rainfall
   durations that were constructed based on the 5 min rainfall data.
   Moreover, changes in IDF results for two 22-year sub-samples were also
   analyzed. Additionally, changes in extreme events clustering at the
   regional scale were also analyzed. Ten rainfall stations (44 years of
   data 1975-2018) located in Slovenia (central EU, approx. 20,000 km(2))
   were used in this study. Results indicate that no clear pattern in the
   detected trends can be found based on the analyzed stations. However,
   all the statistically significant trends at the significance level of
   0.05 for the 5 min rainfall data were negative. Moreover, regional
   trends for this duration were also statistically significant. The
   changes in the design rainfall events between two equal sub-samples
   (1975-1996, 1997-2018) were between -30\% and 60\%. The investigation of
   changes in extreme rainfall event clustering indicated that extreme 5,
   30, and 60 min events could more frequently occur a few days earlier in
   spring or summer compared to the past period. On the other hand, longer
   duration events (i.e., 360 and 720 min) tend to more frequently occur a
   few days later in autumn compared to the past. In most cases, changes
   are not statistically significant.},

Abstract = {Precipitation plays an omni-important role in a developing country like
   India where the lion's share of the economy is dependent on agriculture
   which in turn is dependent on the rains. However, with unplanned
   urbanization and climate change, the precipitation pattern has changed a
   lot. Present work studies the distribution, pattern and trend analysis
   (seasonal and annual) of precipitation for 100 years of upper Godavari
   basin which is an important agricultural belt of India. Various
   statistical methods like Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope estimator and linear
   regression were employed to understand the nature and rate of
   spatial-temporal change. Except monsoon season, there has been a
   decrease in the amount of rainfall during the other seasons. The purpose
   of the trend analysis is to help the policy makers for efficient and
   sustainable water resource management taking in view the grass root
   realities. The effect of environmental change on the spatial and
   temporal dissemination of precipitation is clearly visible in the
   analysis. In general, the study area shows a decline in annual
   precipitation.},

Abstract = {The presence of long-term persistence (LTP) in hydroclimatic time series
   can lead to considerable change in the significance of trend. Therefore,
   past findings of climatic trend analysis without considering LTP in time
   series has become a disputable issue. The objective of this study was to
   assess the spatial patterns in the trends of annual and seasonal
   rainfall amounts and extremes in Peninsular Malaysia considering LTP.
   Daily rainfall data of APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved
   Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation) for the period
   1951-2007 was used to assess the trends using the classical Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test and the modified version of the MK test, which can remove the
   influence of LTP in the significance of trends. The results indicate
   that significant trends in different rainfall indices of Peninsular
   Malaysia obtained using the MK test reduced drastically when LTP was
   taken into consideration. There was almost no change in annual and
   seasonal rainfall amounts, which contradicts the findings of previous
   studies. The field significance of regional trends revealed an increase
   in wet spells at an average rate of 4.8 and 4.9 days/decade in the
   southeast and the southwest respectively during the northeast monsoon,
   and a decrease in rainy days by-1.4 days/decade in the north and an
   increase both in dry spells by 1.0 day/decade in the southeast and in
   the maximum 1 day rainfall by 1.7 mm/decade on the west coast during the
   southwest monsoon. The results indicate that the trends in rainfall
   indices reported in the maritime continent in previous studies should be
   re-evaluated as most of them are due to LTP.},

Abstract = {Annual and seasonal rainfall trends in the Limbang River Basin (LRB),
   located in the equatorial tropics of Malaysian Borneo, have been
   characterised through Mann-Kendall and Spearman's Rho non-parametric
   tests. Rainfall from 13 rain gauge stations in the LRB for the period
   1948-2016 was examined in the present study. Basic statistical analysis
   of rainfall in the region indicates normal distribution, low missing
   percentage and homogenous characteristics of precipitation. Annual and
   seasonal rainfall in the LRB shows spatial variation while considering
   different rain gauge stations. In annual rainfall, eight stations showed
   a decreasing trend and five stations showed an increasing trend. Rain
   gauge stations which showed a statistically significant increase in
   annual rainfall were Limbang DID (2.77 and 2.85 mm/year) and Long Napir
   (3.65 and 3.77 mm/year). In recognising the two annual monsoon seasons
   in this area, a significant increase in rainfall was noticed in Long
   Napir (2.79 and 2.88 mm/year) during the Southwest monsoon (SWM) period.
   During the Northeast monsoon (NEM), along with Long Napir (3.90 and 3.95
   mm/year), Limbang DID (2.86 and 3.02 mm/year), Pandaruan (1.82 and 1.87
   mm/year) and Medamit Nanga (1.93 and 2.00 mm/year) also showed a
   significant increase in rainfall. At the same time, a distinct trend was
   noticed in rainfall amounts during the inter-monsoon (IM) periods.
   During the first inter-monsoon month (April), seven rain gauge stations
   showed an increasing trend in rainfall, whereas in the second
   inter-monsoon month (October), nine stations showed a decreasing
   rainfall trend. In April, Long Napir (1.86 and 1.95 mm/year) indicated a
   significant increasing trend, whereas in the month of October, the rain
   gauge station at Ukong showed a significant decreasing trend (- 2.45 and
   - 2.37 mm/year). Though minor spatial changes in trend characteristics
   were observed among the rain gauge stations, the LRB as a whole showed a
   consistent increasing (significant and non-significant) trend in annual
   and seasonal rainfall.},

Abstract = {Dams are the major source of water for irrigation in India. As a result,
   any variability in rainfall over the catchment area of dams leads to
   huge economic loss. It also triggers water-sharing conflicts. Hence,
   understating the variation in rainfall in association with dams becomes
   essential. For the present study, the upper Godavari basin, primarily
   representing the semi-arid region in India, is selected. To understand
   the rainfall variation, the Mann-Kendall trend test is employed after
   checking the homogeneity of the data. Using the inverse distance
   weighted technique, the monthly, seasonal and annual trends in rainfall
   are interpolated. These interpolated results are then superimposed over
   the location of the dams. The results depict that the rainfall decreases
   in June, while it increases in August for most of the stations. The
   highest increase in monsoon rainfall is experienced in Akole (11.7
   mm/year), while Khuldabad has experienced the maximum decline (- 6.58
   mm/year) in rainfall. When the spatial variability of annual rainfall is
   considered, it is mostly declining in the eastern part of the basin.
   This area of decreasing rainfall accounts for more than 35\% of the
   total basin area. Around 34 dams with capacity of more than 0.5 MCM
   (million cubic meter) are situated here. As a result of declining
   rainfall, the water supply from these dams might get adversely affected.
   Hence, for the upper Godavari basin, based on the rainfall variability
   analysis, policies should focus on demand side management of water
   resources.},

Abstract = {Urban areas in Sahelian West Africa are highly vulnerable to extreme
   hydro-meteorological events. In recent years, Burkina Faso has
   experienced several natural disasters with floods being the most
   frequent. This study investigates flood trends in Ouagadougou and their
   relationship to extreme rainfall events. Fourteen rainfall indices were
   analysed to characterise the frequency and intensity of extreme
   rainfall. A frequency analysis of annual maximum daily rainfall series
   was performed using three statistical distributions. The results showed
   that few of the rainfall indices have significant trends at 5\% level
   over the period 1961-2015. The generalised extreme value distribution
   satisfactorily fit the time-series of annual maximum daily rainfall. An
   analysis of media flood reports revealed that Burkina Faso experienced
   approximately three flood events per year throughout the period
   1986-2016. In the 2000s, the number of flood events increased to five
   per year. Most flood events are caused by rainfall events with return
   periods of less than or equal to 5 years. The results indicated that the
   significant increase in flood risk in Ouagadougou is not only related to
   heavy rainfall but also due to human and environmental factors.},

Title = {The exchange of water and energy between a tropical peat forest and the

Abstract = {Tropical rainforests control the exchange of water and energy between
   the land surface and the atmosphere near the equator and thus play an
   important role in the global climate system. Measurements of latent (LE)
   and sensible heat exchange (H) have not been synthesized across global
   tropical rainforests to date, which can help place observations from
   individual tropical forests in a global context. We measured LE and H
   for four years in a tropical peat forest ecosystem in Sarawak, Malaysian
   Borneo using eddy covariance, and hypothesize that the study ecosystem
   will exhibit less seasonal variability in turbulent fluxes than other
   tropical ecosystems as soil water is not expected to be limiting in a
   tropical forested wetland. LE and H show little variability across
   seasons in the study ecosystem, with LE values on the order of 11 MJ
   m(-2) day and H on the order of 3 MJ m(-2) day(-1). Annual
   evapotranspiration (ET) did not differ among years and averaged 1579 +/-
   47 mm year(-1). LE exceeded characteristic values from other tropical
   rainforest ecosystems in the FLUXNET2015 database with the exception of
   GF-Guy near coastal French Guyana, which averaged 8-11 MJ m(-2) day(-1).
   The Bowen ratio (Bo) in tropical rainforests in the FLUXNET2015 database
   either exhibited little seasonal trend, one seasonal peak, or two peaks.
   Volumetric water content (VWC) and VPD explained a trivial amount of the
   variability of LE and Bo in some of the tropical rainforests including
   the study ecosystem, but were strong controls in others, suggesting
   differences in stomatal regulation and/or the partitioning between
   evaporation and transpiration. Results demonstrate important differences
   in the seasonal patterns in water and energy exchange across different

Abstract = {Time series analyses for climatic factors are important in climate
   predictions. Rainfall is being one of the most important climatic
   factors in today's concern for future predictions; thus, many
   researchers analyze the data series for identifying potential rainfall
   trends. The literature shows several methods in identifying rainfall
   trends. However, statistical trend analysis using Mann-Kendall equation
   and graphical trend analysis are the two widely used and simplest tests
   in trend analysis. Nevertheless, there are few studies in comparing
   various methods in the trend analysis to suggest the simplest methods in
   analyzing rainfall trends. Therefore, this paper presents a comparison
   analysis of statistical and graphical trend analysis techniques for two
   tropical catchments in Sri Lanka. Results reveal that, in general, both
   trend analysis techniques produce comparable results in identifying
   rainfall trends for different time steps including annual, seasonal, and
   monthly rainfalls.},

Title = {Rainfall and river flow trends for the Western Cape Province, South
   Africa},
Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {115},
Number = {9-10},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Climate change has the potential to alter the spatio-temporal
   distribution of rainfall, subsequently affecting the supply and demand
   of water resources. In a water-stressed country such as South Africa,
   this effect has significant consequences. To this end, we investigated
   annual and winter rainfall and river flow trends for the Western Cape
   Province over two periods: 1987-2017 and 1960-2017. Annual rainfall for
   the most recent 30-year period shows decreasing trends, with the largest
   magnitude of decrease at the SA Astronomical Observatory rainfall
   station (-54.38 mm/decade). With the exception of the significant
   decreasing winter rainfall trend at Langewens (-34.88 mm/decade), the
   trends vary between stations for the period 1960-2017. For the period
   1987-2017, statistically significant decreasing winter trends were found
   at four of the seven stations, and range from -6.8 mm/decade at Cape
   Columbine to -34.88 mm/decade at Langewens. Similarly, the magnitudes of
   decreasing winter river flow at Bree@Ceres and Berg@Franschoek are
   greater for the more recent 30-year period than for 1960-2017.
   Correlation coefficients for Vilij@Voeliv rainfall and four river flow
   stations (Berg@Franschoek, Bree@Ceres, Wit River@Drosterkloof and Little
   Berg@ Nieuwkloof) are stronger for shorter periods (i.e. 1987-2017 and
   2007-2017) than that for the longer period, 1960-2017. The
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emphasises the importance of
   studies to assist with model prediction uncertainties. To this end, our
   study expands the understanding of regional hydrological responses to
   rainfall change in the water stressed region of the Western Cape
   Province.
   Significance:
   Historical trend analyses provide the basis for future rainfall and
   river flow projections and also improve our understanding of
   hydrological responses to rainfall change, which is important for water
   resource planning and management in light of recent rainfall shortages
   experienced in the Western Cape region.
   Anthropogenic and natural influences on river systems must be taken into
   account when assessing the impact of rainfall changes on river flow
   because these factors ultimately affect water resource management.
   We identified decreasing winter rainfall trends across the Western Cape
   Province for the most recent three decades.},

Abstract = {Many parts of Sri Lanka are vulnerable to extreme rainfall events
   leading to floods and droughts. This study was focused on a trend
   analysis of climate extremes derived from daily rainfall records. The
   daily rainfall data from 13 meteorological stations representing
   different geographical regions in Sri Lanka for the period 1961-2010
   were chosen. The analysis was carried out separately for summer half
   year (March-August) and winter half year (September-February) to capture
   the possible changes in two growing seasons, Yala and Maha. Magnitudes
   of trends were derived using linear regression analysis while the
   statistical significance was determined using the Mann-Kendall test.
   Spatial maps were used to study the regional differences in climate ex b
   clues. Extreme rainfall events were found to be isolated events without
   coherent increasing or decreasing trends. However, statistically
   significant increasing (decreasing) trends were observed for number of
   dry days (wet days) ranging from 1.1 to 3.1 days/decade in most parts of
   the island during the summer half year, except for the coastal areas of
   the dry zone. No increasing or decreasing trends in extremes were
   observed for the winter half year. Based on the analysis, it was
   concluded that there is widespread climate change leading to increasing
   (decreasing) dry days (wet days) during the summer half year receiving
   rainfall predominantly from the South-West monsoon. However, mixed
   results were obtained for the winter half year.},

Abstract = {In the present manuscript, we analyzed the pre-monsoon (March-April-May)
   rainfall over the Indian summer monsoon region using the Global
   Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) rainfall datasets during
   1979-2015. It is found that the rainfall over the Bay of Bengal (BOB)
   has increased significantly and it is associated with the strengthening
   of local Hadley circulation over the BOB. The increasing Sea Surface
   Temperature (SST) over the Indian Ocean is playing an important role to
   the observed changes in convections and cloudiness over the BOB. In
   addition, the strengthening of the westerly enhances the wind speed and
   transports more moisture to the North Indian Ocean. In addition, warming
   of the SST and large-scale moisture convergence cause the rainfall to
   increase and the latent heat released in the process strengthens the
   divergent wind at 200hPa. This strengthens the local Hadley circulation
   over the BOB, which may affect the monsoon strength over the Indian
   subcontinent, by influencing the onset of the Indian summer monsoon.
   This study will improve the understanding by monitoring the changes in
   the atmospheric processes over the BOB and the Indian subcontinent,
   which may result in better predictability of the Indian summer monsoon.},

Abstract = {Objective: We collected dietary records over the course of nine months
   to comprehensively characterize the consumption patterns of Malagasy
   people living in remote rainforest areas of north-eastern Madagascar.
   Design: The present study was a prospective longitudinal cohort study to
   estimate dietary diversity and nutrient intake for a suite of
   macronutrients, micronutrients and vitamins for 152 randomly selected
   households in two communities. Setting: Madagascar, with over 25 million
   people living in an area the size of France, faces a multitude of
   nutritional challenges. Micronutrient-poor staples, especially rice,
   roots and tubers, comprise nearly 80 \% of the Malagasy diet by weight.
   The remaining dietary components (including wild foods and animal-source
   foods) are critical for nutrition. We focus our study in north-eastern
   Madagascar, characterized by access to rainforest, rice paddies and
   local agriculture. Participants: We enrolled men, women and children of
   both sexes and all ages in a randomized sample of households in two
   communities. Results: Although the Household Dietary Diversity Score and
   Food Consumption Score reflect high dietary diversity, the Minimum
   Dietary Diversity-Women indicator suggests poor micronutrient adequacy.
   The food intake data confirm a mixed nutritional picture. We found that
   the median individual consumed less than 50 \% of his/her
   age/sex-specific Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for vitamins A,
   B-12, D and E, and Ca, and less than 100 \% of his/her EAR for energy,
   riboflavin, folate and Na. Conclusions: Malnutrition in remote
   communities of north-eastern Madagascar is pervasive and
   multidimensional, indicating an urgent need for comprehensive public
   health and development interventions focused on providing nutritional
   security.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the spatial-temporal trends and variability of
   rainfall within East and South Africa (ESA) region. The newly available
   Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS-v2)
   gridded data spanning 37years (1981 to 2017) was validated against gauge
   observations (N=4243) and utilised to map zones experiencing significant
   monotonic rainfall trends. Standardised annual rainfall anomalies
   revealed the spatial-temporal distribution of below and above normal
   rains that are associated with droughts and floods respectively. Results
   showed that CHIRPS-v2 data had a satisfactory skill to estimate monthly
   rainfall with Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE=0.68 and a high temporal
   agreement (r=0.73) while also preserving total amount (beta=0.99) and
   variability (gamma=0.8). Two contiguous zones with significant increase
   in annual rainfall (3-15mmyear(-1)) occurred in Southwest Zambia and in
   Northern Lake Victoria Basin between Kenya and Uganda. The most
   significant decrease in annual rainfall (-20mmyear(-1)) was recorded at
   Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Other significant decreases in annual
   rainfall ranging between -4 and -10mmyear(-1) were observed in Southwest
   Tanzania, Central-South Kenya, Central Uganda and Western Rwanda.
   CHIRPS-v2 rainfall product provides reliable high spatial resolution
   information on amount of rainfall that can complement sparse rain gauge
   network in rain-fed agricultural systems in ESA region. The observed
   spatial-temporal trends and variability in rainfall are important basis
   for guiding targeting of appropriate adaptive measures across multiple
   sectors.},

Title = {Spatial and statistical trend characteristics of rainfall erosivity (R)
   in upper catchment of Baram River, Borneo},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {191},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The upper catchment region of the Baram River in Sarawak (Malaysian
   Borneo) is undergoing severe land degradation due to soil erosion. Heavy
   rainfall with high erosive power has led to a number of soil erosion
   hotspots. The goal of the present study is to generate an understanding
   about the spatial characteristics of seasonal and annual rainfall
   erosivity (R), which not only control sediment delivery from the region
   but also determine the quantity of material potentially eroded. Mean
   annual rainfall and rainfall erosivity range from 2170 to 5167mm and
   1632 to 5319MJmmha(-1)h(-1)year(-1), respectively(.) Seasonal rainfall
   and rainfall erosivity range from 848 to 1872mm and 558 to
   1883MJmmha(-1)h(-1)year(-1) for the southwest (SW) monsoon, 902 to
   2200mm and 664 to 2793MJmmha(-1)h(-1)year(-1) for the northeast (NE)
   monsoon and 400 to 933mm and 331 to 1075MJmmha(-1)h(-1)year(-1) during
   the inter-monsoon (IM) period. Linear regression, Spearman's Rho and
   Mann Kendall tests were applied.Considering the regional mean rainfall
   erosivity in the study area, all the methods show an overall
   non-significant decreasing trend (-9.34, -0.25 and
   -0.30MJmmha(-1)h(-1)year(-1), respectively for linear regression,
   Spearman's Rho and Mann Kendall tests). However, during SW monsoon and
   IM periods, rainfall erosivity showed a non-significant decreasing trend
   (-25.45, -0.52, -0.40, and -8.86, -1.07, -0.77MJmmha(-1)h(-1)year(-1),
   respectively) whereas in NE, monsoon season erosivity showed a
   non-significant increasing trend (14.90, 1.59 and
   1.60MJmmha(-1)h(-1)year(-1), respectively). The mean erosivity density
   ranges from 0.77 to 1.38MJha(-1)h(-1)year(-1) and shows decreasing
   trend. Spatial distribution pattern of erosivity density indicates
   significantly higher occurrence of erosive rainfall in the lower
   elevation portion of the study area. The spatial pattern of mean
   rainfall erosivity trends (linear, Spearman's Rho and Mann Kendall)
   suggests that the study area can be divided into two zones with
   increasing rainfall erosivity trends in the northern zone and decreasing
   trends in the southern zone. These results can be used to plan
   conservation measures to reduce sediment delivery from localized soil
   erosion hotspots.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have reported contrasting inferences in the variability
   and trends of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR). These studies have
   analysed the ISMR variability from a seasonal perspective. The present
   study observed the monthly ISMR trends from June to September for the
   period 1980-2015.The results show a significant contrasting trend of
   rainfall over India (in the heavy, moderate as well as low rainfall
   regions) in each month of the summer season. A significant decline of
   rainfall is occurring in June over the monsoon onset regions of the
   southwest coast of India. The rainfall trend over India exhibits a
   pattern similar to active type (above normal rainfall over central India
   and below normal in the foothills of Himalayas and southeast India) in
   July and September, conversely, a pattern similar to break type occurs
   in August. The monthly variability of summer rainfall is due to the
   changing pattern of low pressure over the Indian landmass and the
   associated modulation of zonal and meridional moisture flow as well as
   low-level vertical motion. The study also observes widespread spatial
   variability in the monthly trends of ISMR and concludes that the
   seasonal trend analysis does not reveal the actual pattern in the
   monthly trends of ISMR.},

Title = {Influence of changes in rainfall and soil moisture on trends in flooding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {575},
Pages = {432-441},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Despite the expectation that increases in rainfall with climatic change
   will result in increases in pluvial flooding, there is more historical
   evidence for decreases in flood magnitude. In Australia, as in many
   other parts of the world, flood magnitudes are mostly decreasing,
   despite increasing rainfall extremes. Here, we show how changes in soil
   moisture have led to decreasing flood magnitudes while rainfall extremes
   have been increasing.
   Using gauged streamflow, catchment average rainfall, and modelled soil
   moisture data across Australia we confirm that streamflow peaks (or
   floods) that occur at least once a year are strongly related to both the
   peak rainfall causing the flood and the antecedent soil moisture
   conditions preceding the storm event. Regions where the magnitude of the
   peak flow has decreased are visually and statistically correlated to
   regions of decreasing soil moisture. Flood magnitudes are more likely to
   increase only for the rarest events, with increases in rainfall offset
   by decreases in soil moisture for more frequent events. A recurrence
   interval dependent tipping point is identified beyond which trends in
   catchment rainfall outweigh those of soil moisture trends and dominate
   the flood response. For regions where soil moisture has decreased, this
   tipping point occurs at an average recurrence interval of ten years or
   more. As most studies investigating trends in flooding generally use
   annual maxima, changes in soil moisture are likely to be the dominant
   mechanism behind observed flood trends. Hence changes in soil moisture
   conditions need to be considered when predicting catchment flood
   response due to climatic change.},

Title = {Improved partial trend method to detect rainfall trends in Hainan Island},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {137},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {2539-2547},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Partial trend method (PTM) is an innovative and efficient trend analysis
   method, especially for sub-trends in different magnitudes. However, it
   depends on graphs and identifies trends subjectively, which limit the
   application for a large mass of data and cannot reveal significant
   variations from natural variability and randomness. To remedy these
   shortcomings, this paper applies a trend index derived from the PTM
   plot, and develops a nonparametric bootstrap approach to identify
   statistically significant trends. The improved PTM is used to detect
   trends of annual rainfall, monthly rainfall, monsoon rainfall, annual
   number of rainy days, and average intensity of daily rainfall in Hainan
   Island from 1950s to 2014. The Mann-Kendall test is also employed for a
   comparison purpose. The PTM reveals that, except at the Sanya station,
   annual rainfall and monsoon rainfall generally show an insignificant
   change in various magnitudes. Rainy days and daily rainfall intensity
   show a prevailing decreasing and increasing trend, respectively. The
   opposite trends explain the no trend in annual rainfall. The trends
   revealed by the PTM and the Mann-Kendall test show high consistency.
   This demonstrates that the PTM index combined with the nonparametric
   bootstrap method is a reliable technique. The improved PTM makes it
   flexible to detect overall and partial trends by graphical analysis, or
   detect significant trends for a mass of data by an index. Not limited to
   rainfall variables, this method is hoped to analyze trends in other
   fields.},

   causes},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Sahel rainfall is dynamically linked to the global Hadley cell and to
   the regional monsoon circulation. It is therefore susceptible to
   forcings from remote oceans and regional land alike. Warming of the
   oceans enhances the stability of the tropical atmosphere and weakens
   deep ascent in the Hadley circulation. Warming of the Sahara and of the
   nearby oceans changes the structure and position of the regional shallow
   circulation and allows more of the intense convective systems that
   determine seasonal rain accumulation. These processes can explain the
   observed interannual to multidecadal variability. Sea surface
   temperature anomalies were the dominant forcing of the drought of the
   1970s and 1980s. In most recent decades, seasonal rainfall amounts have
   partially recovered, but rainy season characteristics have changed:
   rainfall is more intense and intermittent and wetting is concentrated in
   the late rainy season and away from the west coast. Similar subseasonal
   and subregional differences in rainfall trends characterize the
   simulated response to increased greenhouse gases, suggesting an
   anthropogenic influence. While uncertainty in future projections
   remains, confidence in them is encouraged by the recognition that
   seasonal mean rainfall depends on large-scale drivers of atmospheric
   circulations that are well resolved by current climate models.
   Nevertheless, observational and modeling efforts are needed to provide
   more refined projections of rainfall changes, expanding beyond total
   accumulation to metrics of intraseasonal characteristics and risk of
   extreme events, and coordination between climate scientists and
   stakeholders is needed to generate relevant information that is useful
   even under deep uncertainty. This article is categorized under:

Title = {Analysis of Long-Term Trends of Annual and Seasonal Rainfall in the
   Awash River Basin, Ethiopia},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With climate change prevailing around the world, understanding the
   changes in long-term annual and seasonal rainfall at local scales is
   very important in planning for required adaptation measures. This is
   especially true for areas such as the Awash River basin where there is
   very high dependence on rain- fed agriculture characterized by frequent
   droughts and subsequent famines. The aim of the study is to analyze
   long-term trends of annual and seasonal rainfall in the Awash River
   Basin, Ethiopia. Monthly rainfall data extracted from Climatic Research
   Unit (CRU 4.01) dataset for 54 grid points representing the entire basin
   were aggregated to find the respective areal annual and seasonal
   rainfall time series for the entire basin and its seven sub-basins. The
   Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen Slope estimator were applied to the time
   series for detecting the trends and for estimating the rate of change,
   respectively. The Statistical software package R version 3.5.2 was used
   for data extraction, data analyses, and plotting. Geographic information
   system (GIS) package was also used for grid making, site selection, and
   mapping. The results showed that no significant trend (at alpha = 0.05)
   was identified in annual rainfall in all sub-basins and over the entire
   basin in the period (1902 to 2016). However, the results for seasonal
   rainfall are mixed across the study areas. The summer rainfall (June
   through September) showed significant decreasing trend (at alpha <= 0.1)
   over five of the seven sub-basins at a rate varying from 4 to 7.4 mm per
   decade but it showed no trend over the two sub-basins. The autumn
   rainfall (October through January) showed no significant trends over
   four of the seven sub-basins but showed increasing trends over three
   sub-basins at a rate varying from 2 to 5 mm per decade. The winter
   rainfall (February through May) showed no significant trends over four
   sub-basins but showed significant increasing trends (at alpha <= 0.1)
   over three sub-basins at a rate varying from 0.6 to 2.7 mm per decade.
   At the basin level, the summer rainfall showed a significant decreasing
   trend (at alpha = 0.05) while the autumn and winter rainfall showed no
   significant trends. In addition, shift in some amount of summer rainfall
   to winter and autumn season was noticed. It is evident that climate
   change has shown pronounced effects on the trends and patterns of
   seasonal rainfall. Thus, the study contribute to better understanding of
   climate change in the basin and the information from the study can be
   used in planning for adaptation measures against a changing climate.},

Abstract = {Results of extreme precipitation trend analysis, at different spatial
   and temporal scales, have become alarming since the last century, due to
   the global climate change. This work describes the impact of climate
   change on the distribution and trend of maximum daily rainfall in the
   Macta watershed. Monthly maximum rainfall data that were collected over
   41 years (1970 to 2010) on 41 stations were used to validate the present
   research. The extreme values of rainfall maxima (200 to 264 mm/d) are
   located in the northeastern part of the basin during the spring season.
   From 1992 onwards, shifts are observed from monthly, seasonal in
   addition to significant annual trends. Monthly, seasonal, and annual
   rainfall maxima trend analyses were identified using three methods,
   which are Mayer's adjustment method, Sen's innovative method (2012), and
   the Bravais-Pearson test. The study found out a downward trend during
   the first period (1970-1992). On the other hand, the second period
   (1992-2010) revealed significant upward trends. Climate change affects
   all regions except the center part of the study basin.},

Abstract = {A provincial Disaster-causing Rainstorm Severity Index (DRaSI) is
   introduced to quantify the relationship between rainfall and its
   disastrous impacts on Zhejiang province of China, shortened as ZJ-DRaSI.
   ZJ-DRaSI is set up based on the DRaSI for single stations in combination
   with the coverage of rainstorms. The probability distribution function
   (PDF) of ZJ-DRaSI between 1971 and 2015 can be well fitted by the Wakeby
   Distribution with five parameters. It is found that decadal (e.g. 10yr,
   20yr, and so on) return period values of ZJ-DRaSI related to typhoons
   are generally lower than that of non-typhoon events, implying that
   disastrous non-typhoon events have a higher frequency of occurrence. The
   extreme typhoon events have a significant cycle of 22.5 years, while the
   non-typhoon events have a significant cycle of 15 years. Both are
   currently at the high-value phase. The annual extreme value of ZJ-DRaSI
   exhibits an increasing trend of approximately 15\% every 10 years.},

Abstract = {Study on rainfall pattern of a region over a number of years is very
   useful for crop planning and irrigations scheduling. The present study
   deals with the probability and trend analysis of monthly rainfall in
   selected rain gauge stations scattered over the entire State of Haryana.
   Probabilities for drought, normal and abnormal events for monthly
   rainfall have been worked out using monthly rainfall data for 42 years
   (1970-2011), covering 27 rain gauge stations in the State of Haryana.
   Analysis indicated that drought months are more probable than normal
   months while normal months are more probable than abnormal months The
   monotonic trend direction and magnitude of change in rainfall over time
   have been examined using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator
   tests. Using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator, the
   significant decrease in annual rainfall was noticed at Ballabgarh and
   Thanesar, while in monsoon rainfall, a significant decrease was noticed
   at Thanesar and Narnaul. But Sirsa is the only district which shows a
   significant increase in annual and monsoon rainfall. In probability
   analysis the highest per cent of normal, draughts and abnormal months
   was observed for Ambala, Hassanpur and Dujana, respectively.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the spatial pattern of changes in rainfall extremes
   of Sarawak in recent years (1980-2014). The Mann-Kendall (MK) test along
   with modified Mann-Kendall (m-MK) test, which can discriminate
   multi-scale variability of unidirectional trend, was used to analyze the
   changes at 31 stations. Taking account of the scaling effect through
   eliminating the effect of autocorrelation, m-MK was employed to
   discriminate multi-scale variability of the unidirectional trends of the
   annual rainfall in Sarawak. It can confirm the significance of the MK
   test. The annual rainfall trend from MK test showed significant changes
   at 95\% confidence level at five stations. The seasonal trends from MK
   test indicate an increasing rate of rainfall during the Northeast
   monsoon and a decreasing trend during the Southwest monsoon in some
   region of Sarawak. However, the m-MK test detected an increasing trend
   in annual rainfall only at one station and no significant trend in
   seasonal rainfall at any stations. The significant increasing trends of
   the 1-h maximum rainfall from the MK test are detected mainly at the
   stations located in the urban area giving concern to the occurrence of
   the flash flood. On the other hand, the m-MK test detected no
   significant trend in 1- and 3-h maximum rainfalls at any location. On
   the contrary, it detected significant trends in 6- and 72-h maximum
   rainfalls at a station located in the Lower Rajang basin area which is
   an extensive low-lying agricultural area and prone to stagnant flood.
   These results indicate that the trends in rainfall and rainfall extremes
   reported in Malaysia and surrounding region should be verified with m-MK
   test as most of the trends may result from scaling effect.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the spatial and temporal patterns of trends on
   seasonal (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter) and annual
   rainfall time series data (1966-2015) at 13 stations located in the
   central Himalayan region of the Uttarakhand State of India. The temporal
   trend was analyzed using recently proposed innovative trend analysis
   (ITA) method with significance test. The results of the ITA method were
   compared with the Mann-Kendall (MK) test at 5\% significance level. The
   spatial variation of the trends in seasonal and annual rainfall series
   was interpolated using the Thiessen polygon (TP) method in ArcGIS 10.2
   environment. The results of comparison revealed that the trend detected
   by MK test (significantly positive in 3-time series and significantly
   negative in 6-time series) can be effectively identified using ITA
   (significantly positive in 19-time series and significantly negative in
   32-time series). The ITA method could detect some trends that cannot be
   observed by the MK test. According to the spatial distribution of MK
   test, significantly increasing (decreasing) trends were observed in 1
   (0), 1 (2), 0 (1), 1 (1), and 1 (1) polygons in pre-monsoon, monsoon,
   post-monsoon, winter, and annual rainfall data, while the ITA method
   detected significant trends in 3 (7), 6 (5), 1 (9), 4 (5), and 5 (6)
   polygons in the study region. The developed maps of spatial variability
   of rainfall trends may help the stakeholders and/or water resource
   managers to figure out the risk and vulnerability related to climate
   change in the study region.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of rainfall variability is important for regional-scale
   planning and management of water resources in agriculture. This study
   explores spatio-temporal variations, trends, and homogeneity in monthly,
   seasonal, and annual rainfall series of 62 stations located in arid
   region of Rajasthan, India using 55year (1957-2011) data. Box-whisker
   plots indicate presence of outliers and extremes in annual rainfall,
   which made the distribution of annual rainfall right-skewed. Mean and
   coefficient of variation (CV) of rainfall reveals a high inter-annual
   variability (CV>200\%) in the western portion where the mean annual
   rainfall is very low. A general gradient of the mean monthly, seasonal,
   and annual rainfall is visible from northwest to southeast direction,
   which is orthogonal to the gradient of CV. The Sen's innovative trend
   test is found over-sensitive in evaluating statistical significance of
   the rainfall trends, while the Mann-Kendall test identifies
   significantly increasing rainfall trends in June and September. Rainfall
   in July shows prominently decreasing trends although none of them are
   found statistically significant. Monsoon and annual rainfall show
   significantly increasing trends at only four stations. The magnitude of
   trends indicates that the rainfall is increasing at a mean rate of 1.11,
   2.85, and 2.89mmyear(-1) in August, monsoon season, and annual series.
   The rainfall is found homogeneous over most of the area except for few
   stations situated in the eastern and northwest portions where
   significantly increasing trends are observed. Findings of this study
   indicate that there are few increasing trends in rainfall of this Indian
   arid region.},

Title = {Robustness Spatiotemporal Clustering and Trend Detection of Rainfall
   Erosivity Density in Greece},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Soil erosion is affected by rainfall, among other factors, and it is
   likely to increase in the future due to climate change impacts,
   resulting in higher rainfall intensities. This paper evaluates the
   impact of the missing values ratio on the computation of the rainfall
   erosivity factor, R, and erosivity density, ED. The paper also
   investigates the temporal trends and defines regions of Greece with a
   similar monthly distribution of ED using an unsupervised method.
   Preprocessed and free from noise and errors rainfall data from 108
   stations across Greece were extracted from the Greek National Bank of
   Hydrological and Meteorological Information. The rainfall data were
   analyzed and erosive rainfalls were identified, their return period was
   determined using intensity-duration-frequency curves and R and ED values
   were computed. The impact of missing data in the computation of annual
   values of R and ED was investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The
   findings indicated that missing rainfall data resulted in a linear
   underestimation of R, while ED is more robust. The trends in ED
   timeseries were evaluated using the Kendall's Tau test and their
   autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation were computed for a small
   subset of stations using criteria based on the quality of data.
   Furthermore, cluster analysis was applied to a larger subset of stations
   to define regions of Greece with similar monthly distribution of ED. The
   findings of this study indicate that: (a) ED should be preferred for the
   assessment of erosivity in Greece over the direct computation of R, (b)
   ED timeseries are found to be stationary for the majority of the
   selected stations, in contrast to reported precipitation trends for the
   same time period, (c) Greece is divided into three clusters/areas of
   stations with distinct monthly distributions of ED.},

   coherency of changes between the NSI and NPI. However, some minor
   negative coherency patches may expose somewhat impacts of human
   activities, but they were often associated with nearly normal climate
   periods. These suggest that the runoff still depends upon well the

Abstract = {Globally, climate change has caused changes in frequency and intensity
   of climate extremes such as heat waves, droughts, floods and tropical

   Risk and Sector-specific Indices for rainfall, relevant for the
   agriculture and food security sector. The indices have been developed
   for Lower Vellar River sub-basin, a coastal basin in Tamil Nadu, India.
   Trend analysis has been done for the climatic and cropping seasons in
   the sub-basin. Overall, there has not been any trend in the annual
   rainfall index values. The monthly trend values for the different
   indices have mostly exhibited insignificant trends throughout the study
   period (1978-2015) except for a few indices. Overall, the southwest
   monsoon season has shown a significantly decreasing trend in the
   indices. The northeast monsoon season has shown insignificant trends
   with positive slopes for most indices. There were insignificant or no
   trends in the indices for the summer season. The findings from the study
   can be used as a guiding tool for developing adaptation strategies, for

Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to detect the historical dry matter
   yield (DMY) trend and to evaluate the effects of heavy rainfall events
   on the observed DMY trend of whole crop maize (WCM, Zea mays L.) using
   time-series analysis in Suwon, Republic of Korea. The climatic variables
   corresponding to the seeding to harvesting period, including the growing
   degree days, mean temperature, etc., of WCM along with the DMY data (n =
   543) during 1982-2011, were used in the analysis. The DMY trend was
   detected using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with the
   explanatory variables (ARIMAX) form of time-series trend analysis. The
   optimal DMY model was found to be ARIMAX (1, 1, 1), indicating that the
   DMY trend follows the mean DMY of the preceding one year and the
   residual of the preceding one year with an integration level of 1.
   Furthermore, the SHGDD and SHHR were determined to be the main variables
   responsible for the observed trend in the DMY of WCM. During heavy
   rainfall events, the DMY was found to be decreasing by 4745.27 kg/ha (p
   < 0.01). Our analysis also revealed that both the intensity and
   frequency of heavy rainfall events have been increasing since 2005. The
   forecasted DMY indicates the potential decrease, which is expected to be
   11,607 kg/ha by 2045. This study provided us evidence for the
   correlation between the DMY and heavy rainfall events that opens the way
   to provide solutions for challenges that summer forage crops face in the
   Republic of Korea.},

Abstract = {Space-time variability of rainfall at local scale is affected by several
   regional factors such as aerosol concentration, greenhouse gases, land
   cover changes, etc., along with large scale atmospheric circulations.
   Predictive ability of regional circulation models can be significantly
   improved and efficient management of water resources can be assured by
   identifying dominant variables controlling spatiotemporal variations in
   rainfall among aforementioned factors. The present study aims to
   investigate dominant climate system(s) controlling trends in rainfall
   over Chhattisgarh state (a semi-arid region) in India over the period of
   115years (1901-2015). Discrete wavelet transform in conjunction with
   Mann-Kendall test is applied to the rainfall data series at different
   time scales (monthly, seasonal, annual, pre-monsoon, monsoon,
   post-monsoon and winter) in order to identify the long term trends and
   dominant periodic components influencing the trend. In the results,
   negative trends are found to exist in all rainfall time series at
   majority of districts (except for annual and monsoon rainfall at Bijapur
   and Sukma district). In addition, analysis of trend in actual
   evapotranspiration and soil moisture in the region does not exhibits the
   effect of anthropogenic variables (such as land cover change, irrigation
   projects, etc.) on the rainfall as significant negative trend are also
   observed in soil moisture for majority of districts. Overall, 2-year and
   4-year periodic components have been detected to be dominating the
   trends in most of the rainfall time series (annual, monsoon,
   post-monsoon and winter). On comparing the identified dominating
   components with the existing climate systems (Atlantic multidecadal
   oscillations, Indian ocean dipole, Madden-Julian oscillations,
   Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, etc.), El Nino-Southern Oscillations
   has been recognized as predominant climate circulation influencing the

Title = {Contrasting trends in southwest monsoon rainfall over the Western Ghats
   region of India},

Abstract = {This study presents the contrasting trends of rainfall in the northern
   and southern Western Ghats (WG) and examines possible reasons for the
   phenomenon. The WG is one of the important mountain ranges that run
   parallel to the west coast of India. The mountain chain lies almost
   perpendicular to the low level jet stream (LLJ) and hence, receives
   about three times the average rainfall in India. The onset of southwest
   monsoon also occurs at this region, and thus WG plays a key role in
   regulating Indian climate through regional climate modulations.
   Therefore, detecting changes in the rainfall in WG is necessary to
   identify changes in regional climate.Here, we examine the features of
   rainfall received and reasons for the observed rainfall patterns in the
   northern and southern WG. In general, the rainfall peaks are observed in
   low elevated areas with high inter-annual variability. We find an
   increase (decrease) southwest monsoon rainfall of about 1.6mm day(-1)
   decade(-1) in certain pockets of the northern (southern) WG. However, an
   average trend of +0.3 (- 0.39) mm day(-1) decade(-1) is estimated in the
   northern (southern) WG for the 1931-2015 period. Our analyses reveal
   that this contrasting trend in rainfall (i.e. positive in the north and
   negative in the south WG) is due to the northward movement of LLJ; from
   10 degrees N to 15 degrees N. This shift in LLJ is triggered by an
   abnormal increase in the surface temperature of thenorthern Arabian Sea
   and tropospheric temperature of the north India in the recent decades.
   The warming helped the LLJ core to move northwards and that weakened
   (strengthened) the westerly winds over the southern (northern) WG to
   significantly changethe pattern of southwest monsoon rainfall.
   Henceforth, this study cautions the changes in the rainfall pattern over
   WG, which can have significant long-term implications for regional
   climate change.},

Abstract = {Central America is a region vulnerable to hydrometeorological threats.
   Recently, the impacts of droughts caused higher economic losses in
   comparison to, for example, floods and landslides. This study focuses on
   the spatio-temporal behaviour of cumulative rainfall deficits across
   Central America attempting to provide an historical context to the most
   recent drought episodes. We developed a long-term (1950-2014), monthly
   rainfall data set that merged large-scale interpolated products with a
   station observation network to spatially and temporally evaluate the
   12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI12) across the region. We
   found that El Nino cannot always be associated with drier conditions and
   that severe droughts are likely to spatially develop from localized
   phenomena to cover the entire region beyond the Central American drought
   corridor (CADC). Furthermore, there is not always a clear separation
   into the Pacific and Caribbean domain in terms of drought behaviour, but
   generally El Nino episodes can be associated with drier conditions on
   the Pacific slope and wetter conditions in the Caribbean. We could also
   show that trends in the SPI series are spatially variable and that more
   localized significant positive and negative trends exist throughout
   Central America. For example, central pacific Nicaragua was identified
   as a hot spot for significant drying conditions related to El Nino. We
   aim at developing this effort into a nearreal time and publicly
   available drought monitor in the near future to increase resilience and
   adaption efforts in the region.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the rainfall climatology
   in Veranopolis, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, through analyses of means,
   variabilities related to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and
   temporal trends, using a 60-year data series (1956-2015). Descriptive
   statistics of annual, monthly and seasonal rainfall were used to
   characterize the rainfall climatology. The differences between seasons,
   and influence of ENSO were evaluated using analysis of variance and the
   Duncan's test. Rainfall trends were evaluated by the Mann Kendall test.
   The local average annual rainfall is 1,683 mm and the average monthly
   rainfall is 140 mm, varying from 109 (May) to 182 mm (September). The
   annual rainfall has high interannual (standard deviation of 327 mm),
   monthly (60-100 mm) and seasonal (124-183 mm) variabilities, which
   should be considered in non-irrigated agricultural systems using
   rainfall as the main source of water supply to plants. Although autumn
   presents lower average rainfall (346 mm) than the other seasons, its
   average percentages were similar to the total annual rainfall (21-28\%),
   and the rainfalls are well-distributed in the seasons. Differences
   between ENSO events occurred in the spring; La Nina years showed lower
   rainfall (385 mm) than El Nino (549 mm) and neutral (481 mm) years. The
   annual rainfall tended to increase by 6.3 mm per year (p < 0.01), with
   increases of 2.5 mm in spring and 1.9 mm in winter (p < 0.10) in the
   period analyzed.},

Title = {Observed Decadal Transition in Trend of Autumn Rainfall over Central

Abstract = {This article presents a decadal transition from a decreasing trend to an
   increasing trend in the late 1990s for autumn rainfall in central China.
   The atmospheric and oceanic background underlying this regime shift is
   also addressed. Accompanying the above decadal transition, the moisture
   convergence and ascending motion averaged in central China both switch
   from a weakening trend to a strengthening trend. Meanwhile, after the
   late 1990s, the declining of the Asian sea level pressure (SLP) and the
   deepening of the Lake Balkhash trough may induce more cold air from high
   latitudes to break out southward. The strengthening of the low-level
   southerly in East Asia could transport more moisture northward from low
   latitudes. More cold air and more warm-moist airflow encountering in the
   targeted region contribute to the increasing trend of local rainfall.
   The situation before the late 1990s is generally reversed, which
   accounts for the decreasing trend of autumn rainfall. The movement of
   the East Asian jet (EAJ) from southward to northward also has a
   contribution via its influence on dynamic condition. Additionally,
   changes in the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western Indian and
   Atlantic Oceans from a cooling trend to a warming trend in the late
   1990s play significant roles through their modulations on moisture
   transport and cold-air activities.},

Abstract = {With two thirds of the total Indian population employed by the
   agriculture sector, changes in Indian monsoon precipitation have
   widespread implications for human welfare. Increased extreme
   precipitation since 1950 has been widely reported for central India.
   Major studies have relied upon the gridded daily precipitation
   observations provided by the India Meteorological Department (IMD),
   which assimilate observations from a variable network of weather
   stations. Replicating the IMD's interpolation method on satellite-based
   precipitation observations, however, indicates that temporal changes in
   the observing weather station network introduce a jump in the record
   toward more extreme rainfall after 1975. Trends evaluated across this
   jump are suspect, and trends evaluated subsequent to it are
   insignificant (p > 0.1). This positive bias may also mask declines in
   average monsoon rainfall. Greater accuracy in these trends may resolve
   distinctions between climate model simulations of future changes. Access
   to the underlying data from IMD rain-gauges would facilitate improved
   rainfall reconstruction.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Freshwater demand in Southeast Florida is predicted to increase over the
   next few decades. However, shifting patterns in the intensity and
   frequency of drought create considerable pressure on local freshwater
   availability. Well-established water resources management requires
   evaluating and understanding long-term rainfall patterns, drought
   intensity and cycle, and related rainfall deficit. In this study, the
   presence of rainfall monotonic trends was analyzed using linear
   regression and Mann-Kendal trend tests. Pettit's single point detection
   test examined the presence of an abrupt change of rainfall. Drought in
   Southeast Florida is assessed using the Standardized Precipitation Index
   (SPI) in 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-months scale; and the Fast Fourier
   Transform is applied to evaluate the frequency of each drought
   intensity. There was an increase of rainfall in most of the wet season
   months, the total wet season, and the annual total. The wet season
   duration showed a decrease driven by a decrease in October rainfall.
   Since 1990, wet season and total annual rainfall exhibited an abrupt
   increase. The SPI analysis has indicated that extended wetness
   characterizes the contemporary rainfall regime since 1995, except for
   the incidence of intermittent dry spells. Short-term droughts have
   3-year to 5-year recurrence intervals, and sustained droughts have a
   10-year and 20-year recurrence intervals. In Southeast Florida,
   prolonged drought limits freshwater availability by decreasing recharge,
   resulting in a longer hydro-period to maintain the health of the
   Everglades Ecosystem, and to control saltwater intrusion. The increasing
   dry season duration suggests the growing importance of promoting surface
   water storage and demand-side management practices.},

Abstract = {Straddling the Asian-Australian monsoon region, the Maritime Continent
   (MC) experiences substantial rainfall variations from diurnal to
   interannual and longer time scales. In this study, rainfall over
   Singapore and the wider MC region are analyzed using objectively
   identified weather regimes. Eight regional-scale weather regimes are
   derived by k-means clustering of local vertical profiles of zonal and
   meridional winds, temperature, and specific humidity extracted over
   Singapore from ERA-Interim data for the period December 1980-November
   2014. The composite synoptic flow and rainfall patterns over the region
   show that the weather regimes correspond to the seasonal migration of
   the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) across the equator. For
   Singapore, the regimes depict seasonal rainfall variability by capturing
   the alternating dry and wet phases of the prevailing local monsoon and
   transition periods associated with the regional-scale ITCZ movement.
   Following previous work, the regimes are used to examine the annual
   rainfall trend by calculating the contributions due to 1) changes in
   regime frequency, indicating regional-scale circulation changes, and 2)
   changes in within-regime precipitation, indicating altered thermodynamic
   conditions. The overall trend observed at Singapore and many other MC
   locations is overwhelmingly due to changes in within-regime
   precipitation. However, the overall trend masks the larger contribution
   resulting from regime frequency changes as these circulation changes
   tend to offset one another in reality. In many MC areas (including
   Singapore), summed rainfall changes due to regime frequency changes
   outweigh those due to changes in within-regime rainfall, when aggregated
   in an absolute sense.},

Title = {Uncertainty in Estimated Trends Using Gridded Rainfall Data: A Case
   Study of Bangladesh},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study assessed the uncertainty in the spatial pattern of rainfall
   trends in six widely used monthly gridded rainfall datasets for
   1979-2010. Bangladesh is considered as the case study area where changes
   in rainfall are the highest concern due to global warming-induced
   climate change. The evaluation was based on the ability of the gridded
   data to estimate the spatial patterns of the magnitude and significance
   of annual and seasonal rainfall trends estimated using Mann-Kendall (MK)
   and modified MK (mMK) tests at 34 gauges. A set of statistical indices
   including Kling-Gupta efficiency, modified index of agreement (md),
   skill score (SS), and Jaccard similarity index (JSI) were used. The
   results showed a large variation in the spatial patterns of rainfall
   trends obtained using different gridded datasets. Global Precipitation
   Climatology Centre (GPCC) data was found to be the most suitable
   rainfall data for the assessment of annual and seasonal rainfall trends
   in Bangladesh which showed a JSI, md, and SS of 22\%, 0.61, and 0.73,
   respectively, when compared with the observed annual trend. Assessment
   of long-term trend in rainfall (1901-2017) using mMK test revealed no
   change in annual rainfall and changes in seasonal rainfall only at a few
   grid points in Bangladesh over the last century.},

Title = {Trend analysis of rainfall and drought over the Oum Er-Rbia River Basin

Abstract = {In a context of water scarcity in Morocco, the proper management of
   water resources is becoming a national priority. However, the strong
   spatiotemporal fluctuation of rainfall, considered as the first source
   of surface water intakes, complicates attempts to work on such a
   long-term purpose. In this work, we aim to provide an analysis of
   rainfall variability over the Oum Er-Rbia (OER) River basin, one of the
   most important basins in Morocco. For this, we assessed the annual
   rainfall deficit using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and
   then analyzed trends at annual, seasonal, and monthly bases using the
   Mann-Kendall test. The study was conducted on a set of data from 15
   stations over a 40-years period (1970-2010). The results show that the
   OER River basin tends towards drier conditions. An abundance of deficit
   seasons has been noticed (50 to 63\% of the seasons), especially after
   1980-1981. Since then, the basin has known several deficit periods,
   sometimes of great spatial extent such as those that occurred in the
   1980s and 1990s. Moreover, during the study period, the total annual
   rainfall has demonstrated a general decreasing tendency. The latter was
   mainly induced by changes in winter and spring months, which experienced
   some of the largest decline rates with a special abundant significance
   during the month of April.},

Title = {A new and flexible rainy season definition: Validation for the Greater
   Horn of Africa and application to rainfall trends},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {989-1012},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous studies on observed or projected rainfall trends for the
   Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) generally focus on calendric 3-month
   periods, and thus partly neglect the complexity of rainfall seasonality
   in this topographically heterogeneous region. This study introduces a
   novel and flexible methodology to identify the rainfall seasonality, the
   onset, cessation and duration of the rainy seasons and the associated
   uncertainties from rainfall time series. The definition is applied to
   the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)
   satellite product and an extensive rain gauge data set. A strong
   agreement with known seasonal dynamics in the region and the commonly
   used calendric rainy seasons is demonstrated. Compared to the latter
   definition, a clear added value is found for the new approach as it
   captures the local rainfall features (associated with, for example, the
   sea breeze), thus facilitating evaluations across rainfall seasonality
   borders. While previously known trends are qualitatively confirmed,
   trends are amplified in some regions using the flexible definition
   method. Notably, a drying trend in Tanzania and Democratic Republic of
   Congo and a wetting trend in central Sudan and parts of eastern Ethiopia
   and Kenya can be detected. The trends are regionally associated with
   changes in rainy season cessation. CHIRPS and station trend patterns are
   consistent over larger regions of the GHA, but differ in regions with
   known rainfall contributions from warmer cloud tops. Discrepancies are
   found in coastal and topographically complex areas, and regions with an
   unstable seasonality of rainfall. As expected, CHIRPS shows spatially
   more homogeneous trends compared to station data. The more precise
   definition of the rainy season facilitates the assessment of rainfall
   characteristics like intensity, rainfall amounts or temporal shifts of
   rainy seasons. This novel methodology could also provide a more adequate
   calibration of climate model simulations thus potentially enabling more
   realistic climate change projections for the GHA.},

Abstract = {For Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite
   data, Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a radiative skin temperature
   that is measured in the direction of the atmosphere to the ground. This
   data has been used several times in climatological and environmental
   studies. The tropical rainforest is one of valuable area on this earth
   that is need to be protected. It exhibits high levels of biodiversity
   and habitat of animal and plant species on the planet. In Thailand, a
   tropical rainforest can be found in Hala-Bala where is situated at the
   boundary of Thai-Malaysia. In mathematical analysis, cubic spline is an
   approximation function. It gives smooth and flexible way of fitting non
   linear models, while Generalized Estimate Equation (GEE) is statistical
   method of parameter estimation for the correlated data from longitudinal
   studies at different points in time. The purpose of this study was to
   analyze the data of LST by using cubic spline and GEE to perceive trend
   and variation at Hala-Bala in Narathiwat, Southern Thailand during
   2002-2017. LST data were recorded by MODIS, an important data resource
   provided efficiency information relating to the Earth, between 2002 and
   2017. The result of cubic spline showed that it was fitted quite well on
   pattern of LST data. The LST has increased statistically significant
   around the center pixel. GEE showed that LST trends had changed with
   statistically significant over 15 years.},

   rainfall trends is highly beneficial for the country's livelihood and
   safety. In this work, we studied the rainfall distribution in the
   National Capital Region covering the period of 2013 to 2016, and
   analysed the data using the Mann-Kendall Test and the Bootstrap
   procedure. Using a monthly scale, we found a negative trend, signifying
   a decrease in rainfall amount over the four years of data.
   Interestingly, we found a positive trend using a yearly scale, showing
   an increase of rainfall overall. Therefore it is quite risky to
   generalize a certain region's rainfall condition just by looking at it
   annually, but must consider as well its seasonal and monthly phenomena
   for a more detailed analysis. We note also that the area being studied
   was considerably large and the rainfall data varied with the location of
   the weather station where it was obtained. This work demonstrates the
   potential of using Big Data and the Internet of Things to measure and
   predict weather trends using various sensors and processors.},

Abstract = {Mean and extreme northwest Australian (NWA) summertime rainfall has
   increased significantly since 1950. While previous studies have explored
   a range of possible factors impacting NWA rainfall, the causes of this
   increase and possible future changes remain uncertain. This study
   explores the increasing NWA summertime rainfall trends in Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) models. By using a suite of
   models that contributed realizations of the historical period with
   various forcings, we explore the impact to this region of greenhouse
   gases and aerosol emissions since 1950 on mean rainfall and three
   extreme rainfall indices. The observed NWA rainfall trend is better
   captured in models when all forcings are included compared to
   simulations with only greenhouse gas forcing or with only natural
   forcing, although the models have a large spread. We hypothesise that
   anthropogenic aerosols played a major role in the observed rainfall
   trends, and the associated increase in monsoonal flow, and hence
   historicalNat and historicalGHG simulations tend not to capture observed
   rainfall trend. Throughout the 21st century, CMIP5 models simulate a
   stronger increase in mean summer precipitation and extreme indices of
   NWA rainfall in representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5
   simulations than in RCP2.6. The NWA region shows intensified extreme
   events with fewer heavy precipitation days, but the reliability of these
   projections in this region should be further tested with estimates of
   future anthropogenic aerosol changes.},

Abstract = {Establishing patterns of natural variability of water resources in lakes
   is important for water management. However, the availability of reliable
   data often becomes obstacles, especially in ungauged regions. Rainfall
   products from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) potentially
   fill this gap. The aim of this study is to assess the trend of rainfall
   over Indonesian major lakes using TRMM rainfall estimates to investigate
   the natural variability of rainfall over the lakes. TRMM 3B43 monthly
   data over the period of 1998-2017 obtained from Giovanni data portal
   maintained by NASA were used to assess the trend of rainfall over
   Indonesian major lakes. Rainfall correlation with El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) variability was also investigated using Southern
   Oscillation Index (SOI) and Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI). Trend
   analysis was carried out using Mann-Kendall test. Rainfall depths over
   Lake Laut Tawar in Sumatra tend to gradually decline, which is confirmed
   by the Mann-Kendall test. Result of the test of rainfall over all other
   investigated lakes on Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Papua, and Java indicate no
   trends except for that of Lake Paniai on Papua, which indicates an
   increasing trend.},

Abstract = {In a country India, in the most of the regions, almost 80\% of the
   annual precipitation is concentrated during monsoon months. As a result,
   the inflows in the river and inflows available for the water resources
   projects are also concentrated in the monsoon season (i.e. June to
   October). In view of the changing climate, analysis of changing rainfall
   pattern bears importance for the safe operation of the hydraulic
   structures and also, for water and food security. In this study, monthly
   time period of the monsoon season and annual rainfall trends have been
   studied to assess the impact of climate change in the region. The
   monthly rainfall data series from 1970 to 2016 (47 years) have been made
   available for the raingauge sites in the Unch watershed of Orsang River.
   The Orsang River is a tributary of the Narmada River in the Gujarat
   State of India. The monthly and annual rainfall data series trend
   analysis has been carried out for these raingauges installed in a Orsang
   River basin. Four raingauge stations namely, Kalarani, Sanjuli, Vora,
   and Dhandhoda are installed in the Unch watershed of the Orsang River
   basin. Sanjuli and Dhandhoda are located in the Chhota Udepur Tehsil of
   Vadodara District, while Kalarani and Vora are located in a Sankheda and
   Tilakwada Tehsil of the Vadodara District respectively. It is summarized
   that the climate change impacts on the small-regional scale study area
   confirms the increase in the annual rainfall magnitude, decreasing June
   month rainfall, increasing July month rainfall, decreasing in the August
   month rainfall magnitude, decreasing in the intense rainfall in the
   month of August, and shifting of the monsoon season to start and finish
   late.},

Title = {Rainfall Trend Analysis in Uma Oya Basin, Sri Lanka, and Future Water
   Scarcity Problems in Perspective of Climate Variability},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {The effect of climate variability on the rainfall pattern is canvassed
   on the Uma Oya river basin, Sri Lanka, consisting of 5 rainfall gauging
   stations. The Uma Oya basin (720km(2)) is given utmost precedence due to
   environmental concerns seen in the ongoing Uma Oya multipurpose
   development project (529million USD worth) which is expected to divert
   water to the southeast dry zone of the country while adding 231GWh/year
   electricity to the national grid. The rainfall data for a period of
   26years (1992-2017) were analysed using Mann-Kendall's test and Sen's
   slope estimator test to identify the rainfall trends. Both of these
   trend analysis test results depict only one negative trend for
   Hilpankandura Estate for the month of June; however, the seasonal trend
   analysis and annual trend analysis do not support this observation.
   Nevertheless, Mann-Kendall's test showed potential positive trends for
   the 3 rainfall gauging stations Kirklees Estate, Ledgerwatte Estate, and
   Welimada Group only in the 1(st) intermediate period (March-April), and
   this is well supported by the monthly trend analysis. Other than these
   trends, the results do not show any significant negative trends in the
   Uma Oya catchment. Therefore, the results vividly explain that there is
   no threat of water scarcity to the catchment area being resistant to
   changing global climate for the past 26years.},

Abstract = {The analysis of precipitation trends for Vietnam revealed that
   early-monsoon precipitation has increased over the past three decades
   but to varying degrees over the northern, central and southern portions
   of the country. Upon investigation, it was found that the change in
   early-monsoon precipitation is associated with changes in the low-level
   cyclonic airflow over the South China Sea and Indochina that is embedded
   in the large-scale atmospheric circulation associated with a La
   Nina-like anomalous sea surface temperature pattern with warming in the
   western Pacific and Indian Oceans and cooling in the eastern Pacific.
   The Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) was subsequently
   used for an attribution analysis. Over northern Vietnam an early-monsoon
   increase in precipitation is attributed to changes in both greenhouse
   gases and natural forcing. For central Vietnam, the observed increase in
   early-monsoon precipitation is reproduced by the simulation forced with
   greenhouse gases. However, over southern Vietnam the early-monsoon
   precipitation increase is less definitive where aerosols were seen to be
   preponderant but natural forcing through the role of the Interdecadal
   Pacific Oscillation may well be a factor that is not resolved by CCSM4.
   Increased early-monsoonal precipitation over the coastal lowland and
   deltas has the potential to amplify economic and human losses.},

   monthly and seasonal temporal scales for the period 1950-2006.
   Dependency of data is assessed by application of autocorrelation plot or
   correlogram. MK test or MK-CF2 test is applied for evaluation of trend
   significance for independent or dependent data, respectively. SS test is
   applied for evaluation of trend magnitude. Also, ITA plot and SC are
   used to aid the results of trend analyses. The results showed existence
   of significant increasing trend in April month rainfall series.},

Abstract = {Climate change has significantly affected the rainfall characteristics
   which can influence the pollutant build-up and wash-off patterns from
   the catchment. Therefore, this study explored the influence of varying
   rainfall characteristics on urban and agricultural runoff pollutant
   export using statistical approaches. For this purpose, Mann-Kendall and
   Pettitt's test were applied to detect the trend and breakpoint in
   rainfall characteristics time series. In addition, double mass curve and
   correlation analysis were used to drive the relationship between
   rainfall-runoff and pollutant exports from both catchments. The results
   indicate a significant decreased in total rainfall and average rainfall
   intensity, while a significant increased trend for antecedents dry days
   and total storm duration over the study periods. The breakpoint was
   determined to be 2013 which shows remarkable trend shifts for total
   rainfall, average rainfall intensity and antecedents dry days except
   total duration. Double mass curve exhibited a straight line with
   significant rainfall-runoff relationship indicates a climate change
   effect on both sites. Overall, higher pollutant exports were observed at
   both sites during the baseline period as compared to change periods. In
   agricultural site, most of the pollutants exhibited significant (p<
   0.05) association with total rainfall, average rainfall intensity and
   total storm duration. In contrast, pollutants from urban site
   significantly correlated with antecedent dry days and average rainfall
   intensity. Thus, total rainfall, average rainfall intensity and total
   duration were the significant factors for the agricultural catchment
   while, antecedents dry days and average rainfall intensity were key
   factors in build-up and wash-off from the urban catchment.},

Abstract = {This study aims to analyse the seasonality of rainfall for Jharkhand
   State, India over the period of the last 102 years. Rainfall seasonality
   index and individual seasonality index values were calculated, and trend
   analysis was performed on yearly data for the individual seasonality
   index, using the Mann-Kendall test, the sequential Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's slope method (also known as the Theil-Sen estimator). The value of
   the mean individual seasonality index varied from 0.815378 to 0.977228,
   which indicates that rainfall in Jharkhand is markedly seasonal, with a
   long dry season. The results of the Mann-Kendall trend test revealed a
   significant decreasing trend in individual seasonality index over
   Deoghar, Dumka, Godda, Pakaur and Sahebganj; however, the magnitude of
   this trend was found to be close to negligible. This decreasing trend
   could have a pronounced effect on agricultural activities.},

Abstract = {Understanding rainfall characteristics plays a vital role in sustainable
   watershed development and management, but at the same time it is
   challenging in mountainous regions, due to its topography complexities.
   This study investigates the seasonal along its associated months and
   annual rainfall characteristics and their variations over two distinct
   river basins; Kaligandaki in central west and Koshi in eastern Nepal,
   located on the southern slopes of the central Himalayas, which is
   crucial to the research of the climate change in these regions. The
   rainfall data series over the period of 34-year (1981-2015) of 43
   stations between the elevation range of 143 m asl to 3870 m asl was used
   for this study. The analysis was carried out to assess the significance
   of rainfall trend along with its magnitude followed by its abrupt shift
   by using the Mann-Kendall test, Sen's test and Sequential Mann-Kendall
   test respectively. Furthermore, multitaper method was used to confirm
   the influence of large-scale circulation indices over the study area. An
   increasing pattern of rainfall from south to north was observed
   throughout all season in Koshi basin which was not seen in the
   Kaligandaki basin, indicating the effects of orography along with
   monsoon. Both basins share a similar pattern of rainfall between annual
   and monsoonal rainfall, supporting that both basins are dominated by the
   monsoon. The transition months between the seasons showed almost similar
   spatial distribution but different from other months of respective
   seasons. The results showed that the seasonal and annual rainfall
   declined in most of the stations of both the basins, except during
   pre-monsoon where it showed increased rainfall. But only a few stations
   showing such changes were statistically significant. In fact, these
   noticeable significant decreases were observed especially in the
   southern and northern region of Koshi basin while in Kaligandaki basin,
   it was found either in central or in the southern region. Furthermore,
   the trend shift analysis identified change points during 1980s or early
   1990s, but most significant shifts were observed in recent years with
   some exceptions. Spectral analysis showed significant peaks at
   periodicity ranging 2-5 years, suggesting a potential association with
   Quasi-Biennial Oscillations (QBO) and El Nifio-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO).},

Abstract = {Autumn rain of West China is a typical climate phenomenon, which is
   characterized by continuous rainy days and large rainfall amounts and
   exerts profound impacts on the economic society. Based on daily
   precipitation data from 524 observation stations for the period of
   1961-2014, this article comprehensively examined secular changes in
   autumn rain of West China, including its amount, frequency, intensity,
   and associated extremes. The results generally show a significant
   reduction of rainfall amount and rainy days and a significant
   enhancement of mean rainfall intensity for the average of West China
   during autumn (September-October) since 1961. Meanwhile, decreasing
   trends are consistently observed in the maximum daily rainfall, the
   longest consecutive rainy days, the greatest consecutive rainfall
   amount, and the frequencies of the extreme daily rainfall, consecutive
   rainfall, and consecutive rainfall process. Further analysis indicates
   that the decreases of autumn rainfall and related extremes in West China
   are associated with the decreases in both water vapor content and
   atmospheric unstable stratification during the past decades. On the
   regional scale, some differences exist in the changes of autumn rainfall
   between the eastern and western parts of West China. Besides, it is
   found that the autumn rainy season tends to start later and terminate
   earlier particularly in eastern West China.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an investigation of the temporal rainfall variability, in
   a large area of southern Italy, has been carried out using a homogeneous
   monthly rainfall dataset of 559 rain gauges with more than 50years of
   observation. The area under investigation is a large portion of the
   Italian peninsula, ranging from the Campania and the Apulia regions in
   the North, to Sicily in the South, and covering an area of about
   85,000km(2). Possible trends in seasonal and annual rainfall values have
   been detected by means of a new graphical technique, Sen's method, which
   allows the trend identification of the low, medium and high values of a
   series. Moreover, the Mann-Kendall test has been also applied. As a
   result, different values and tendencies of the highest and of the lowest
   rainfall data have emerged among the five regions considered in the
   analysis. In particular, at seasonal scale, a negative trend has been
   detected especially in winter and in autumn in the whole study area,
   whereas not well defined trend signals have been identified in summer
   and spring.},

Abstract = {Background The Amazonian Amerindian populations living in the southern
   and southwestern hinterlands of Suriname (South America) have come into
   contact with western health care since approximately fifty years ago. In
   this study, secondary data were used to assess the impact: of Medical
   Mission's fifty-year old primary health care program cm the health
   status of these populations.
   Methods Using data from the primary health care facilities of Medical
   Mission for 1965-1970, 1973-1977, 1982-1985, and 1997-2014, temporal
   trends in incidence and mortality of respiratory tract infections,
   gastroenteritis, and malaria; population composition; birth and death
   rates; and polyclinic consultations in these communities have been
   assessed over the period between 1965 and 2014.
   Results In the period covered by this study, the incidence of
   respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis declined by about 75\%
   and 53\%, respectively, while malaria incidence rose sharply from the
   1980s through 2005 but subsequently declined to levels approximating
   elimination. Crude death rates dropped by about 70\% while birth rates
   declined by about 50\% in the 1980s and since then remained at this
   level. The population doubled in size and increased in all age groups,
   particularly in the age group of >59 years. The infant mortality rate
   declined by 50\%. In addition, the average yearly number of polyclinic
   visits per person decreased 6- to 7-fold during this period.
   Conclusions The significant reduction of the infectious disease burden;
   the doubling of the population size and the growth of the proportion of
   elderly individuals due to the declining death rates; the declining
   infant mortality rates to levels comparable to the national average as
   well as the decline in average numbers of polyclinic consultations per
   person, indicate that Medical Missions health service provision achieved
   its goal of improving the health and survival of the indigenous people
   by providing free, accessible and permanent medical services. Building
   upon this successful experience Medical Mission could be instrumental in
   addressing potential contemporary life-style related health threats.},

Title = {Analysis of Rainfall Trends and its Spatial Patterns During the Last
   Century over the Gangetic West Bengal, Eastern India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Long-term spatial and temporal trends of rainfall at monthly, seasonal,
   and annual scales have been studied for 12 meteorological stations of
   the Gangetic West Bengal located in Eastern India during 1901-2002 using
   102 years of rainfall data. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and
   Sen's slope estimator were used to detect trends and their slope. The
   changes are calculated in percentage over the time period. The results
   highlight a marked increase in post-monsoon (33.87\%), the overall
   increase in annual (2.61\%), a considerable decrease in winter (14.83\%)
   as well as pre-monsoon (4.03\%), and an inconsequential increase in
   monsoonal (1.21\%) rainfall. In the annual and monsoonal series, the
   trend is positive in the southern half but negative in the northern
   counterpart. A considerable decrease in rainfall during June and August
   at most stations signifies that monsoon is losing in the early monsoonal
   months with an occurrence of mid-season dry spells. The increase in
   rainfall during September (13.80\%) and October (34.38\%) reveals that
   the monsoon is shifting toward these late monsoon and post-monsoon
   months, respectively. Both the decrease of rainfall in June (early
   monsoonal month), as well as an increase in rainfall in September (late
   monsoonal month) and October (start of post-monsoonal month), suggest
   that the monsoon is being delayed on its onset and withdrawal. In the
   Rarh region, monsoon rainfall is reducing whereas post-monsoon rainfall
   is increasing. In the Deltaic region, both monsoon and post-monsoon
   rainfalls are increasing. Such altering patterns of rainfall call for
   reviewing the agricultural practices and water use in this region.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study used data from the Global Rainfall
   Climatology Project (GPCP) global gridded data observation to
   statistical analysis rainfall over the Indochina Peninsula (from 1981 to
   2017 (37 years)) with a domain of 2.5 degrees by 2.5 degrees grid
   spacing. The central tendency (mean, range, etc.) and dispersion (S.D,
   CV, etc.) were used in the statistical analysis. For identifying the
   trend in the rainfall data, the statistical analysis of linear
   regression was used in this study. The results in this study were shown
   the total amount of rainfall changes over three periods that were period
   I (1981-1990), period II (1991-2000), period III (20012010) and period
   IV (2011-2017). In the basic statistical was analyzed rainfall annual,
   rainfall monthly, and regression monthly rainfall analysis over ICP. In
   basic statistical was shown the highest annual mean rainfall was 2017,
   which recorded an amount of 162.91 mm. The record indicated the standard
   deviation correlating the highest annual mean rainfall was 51.99 mm.
   From the results of the linear regression analysis revealed downward
   trends in the rainfall for the months of April, July, October, and
   December and an upward trend for other months. In this study was shown
   the overall trend of the spatial pattern over ICP.},

Title = {Influence of temporal data aggregation on trend estimation for intense
   rainfall},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {304-316},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Due to their influence on design guidelines, there is great interest in
   quantifying the possible impacts of climate change on extreme rainfall
   return levels. These studies can be affected by existing distortions in
   available rainfall historical series. The effect of the temporal
   aggregation (or time resolution), t(a ), of rainfall observations on the
   estimation of trends in annual maxima over the last 100 years is
   examined here. We have used long-term historical rainfall observations
   with various temporal aggregations, due to the progress of recording
   systems through time, at 10 representative meteorological stations
   located in an inland region of Central Italy. Series of annual maximum
   rainfall depths, H-d , for given durations, d, have been then derived.
   It is well known that H-d values derived from rainfall data
   characterized by every t(a )may involve underestimation errors, that for
   t(a)> approximate to 10 min can become important. Considering that all
   selected stations were installed in the first half of the twentieth
   century, each H-d series can be assumed as inhomogeneous since it
   contains values obtained by rainfall data with t o values ranging from
   fine (e.g. 1 min) to coarse (e.g. 24 h),thus with different levels of
   underestimation. By using a recently developed mathematical relation
   between average underestimation error and the ratio t(a)/d, we then
   correct each H-d value has been corrected through two different
   approaches, obtaining quasi-homogeneous series. Successively, commonly
   used climatic trend tests, including least-squares linear trend
   analysis, Mann-Kendall, Spearman's rank correlation, and Sen's method,
   have been applied to the inhomogeneous and quasi-homogeneous H(d)(
   )series. The results show that the underestimation of H-d values with
   coarse t o plays a significant role in the analysis of the effects of
   climatic change on extreme rainfalls. Specifically, the correction of
   the H-d values can change the sign of the trend from positive to
   negative, mainly for series characterized by high probability to include
   H-d values with t(a)/d =1.},

Title = {Using camera traps to examine distribution and occupancy trends of
   ground-dwelling rainforest birds in north-eastern Madagascar},
Journal = {BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {567-580},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Camera trap surveys are a non-invasive way to monitor wildlife
   populations. Although most often used to study medium- and large-sized
   mammals, camera traps also detect non-target species. These detections
   provide useful ecological information on little-known species, but such
   data usually remain unanalysed. We used detections from camera-trapping
   surveys of native carnivores and small mammals to examine distribution
   patterns and occupancy trends of little-known ground-dwelling rainforest
   birds at seven sites across the Masoala-Makira protected area complex in
   north-eastern Madagascar. We obtained 4,083 detections of 28 bird
   species over 18,056 trap nights from zoo to 2013. We estimated occupancy
   across the Masoala-Makira protected area complex (hereafter, landscape
   occupancy) and annual trends in occupancy at three resurveyed sites for
   five commonly observed species. Landscape occupancy across
   Masoala-Makira ranged from 0.75 (SE 0.09; Madagascar Magpie-robin
   Copsychus albospecularis) to 0.25 (SE 0.06; Scaly Ground-roller
   Geobiastes squamiger). Ground-dwelling forest bird occupancy was similar
   at forest sites that ranged from intact to fully degraded; however,
   three species were detected less often at sites with high feral cat trap
   success. Nearly half of all focal species showed declines in annual
   occupancy probability at one resurveyed site (So2) from 2008 to 2013.
   The declines in ground-dwelling bird occupancy could have community-wide
   consequences as birds provide ecosystem services such as seed dispersal
   and pest regulation. We suggest immediate conservation measures-such as
   feral cat removal-be implemented to protect ground-dwelling forest birds
   and other threatened taxa across this landscape.},

Abstract = {A daily rainfall database covering the Jucar and Segura river basin
   authorities (east Iberian Peninsula, Spain) with high spatial density
   without gaps (890 series) has been created for the complete period
   1955-2016. This has allowed a trend analysis of precipitation and
   dry/wet spells with a better spatial detail and coverage of key
   headwaters sectors than previous studies in this area. Results show
   significant negative trends for precipitation prevailing in Jucar area
   (an annual average loss of 51mm), especially towards its north interior
   headwaters. For this last one the annual loss exceeds 200mm (20\% of
   precipitation). By contrast, certain pre-littoral sectors and most of
   the Segura area are remaining out of these negative trends (some local
   positive trends). However, the dry spells length and the number of dry
   days have increased in a generalized way (Jucar and Segura basins) with
   rainfall concentration in time and space. The decrease of moderate
   rainfall with greater precipitation effectiveness and weight in the key
   interior headwaters is the most significant. On the contrary, there has
   been an increase in extreme torrential rainfall (with poor effectiveness
   and high risk) at points on the coast and pre-littoral towards south of
   the region. These results are linked to a change in the frequency of
   three basic synoptic types identified in the region as rainfall origin.},

Title = {Statistical detection and no-detection of rainfall change trends and

Abstract = {Rainfall variability is an important feature of semiarid climates with
   major effects on hydrology, and beyond on key water-dependent societal
   aspects. Eventual changes in rainfall variability are a strong driver of
   change of hydrological processes, resources, and hazards, up to
   catchment signatures and spatial arrangements. We deal with observed
   precipitations and subsequent statistical coefficients available from a
   network of 15 rainfall gauges over and around the Merguellil catchment
   (1175km(2)), with series ranging up to the 1961-2013 period. We look for
   eventual annual trends and breakpoints with a set of methods: Mann
   Kendall test, Pettitt test, Hubert segmentation procedure, Buishand U
   statistic, and Lee Heghinian Bayesian procedure. The results underline
   oscillation of dry and wet periods; several studied rain gauges (Tella,
   Oueslatia foret, Majbar, Kesra foret, Henchir Bhima, and Haffouz DGRE)
   denote significant trends in annual precipitation. Some breaks are
   detected but they are not synchronous. These methods reveal the
   variability of rainfall regimes in the semiarid region and provide a
   synoptic view of detection and no-detection of symptoms of change. This
   work gives opportunities to water stakeholders and climate experts in
   understanding the relationships between climate variability and water
   availability.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the spectral trend of vegetation with
   rainfall in El Nino-Southern Oscillation events (ENSO) in the Atlantic
   Forest, Brazil. Monthly rainfall data were collected from 85
   conventional meteorological stations (EMC), data from the Enhanced
   Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) and ENSO events (El Nino, La Nina, and
   Neutral) in the period from 2001 to 2013. Afterwards, state cluster
   analysis was performed using the results of non-parametric tests. The
   Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test did not identify a trend pattern
   in rainfall distribution in the Atlantic Forest. The results for EVI2 by
   state and region showed that the trend is decreasing in the Northeast
   Region, except for the states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. Southeast
   region showed an increasing trend of EVI2 (except for Rio de Janeiro and
   SAo Paulo), while the South region showed a decreasing trend. In the
   Midwest, the trend was significantly decreasing. In the prognosis
   elaborated for the future, the regions with significant declines of the
   vegetation were the Northeast and Midwest. This study shows that the
   Atlantic Forest in some regions of Brazil has been suffering from the
   growing urbanization process and there is a trend of soil degradation.},

Title = {Rainfall erosivity in Slovenia: Sensitivity estimation and trend
   detection},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {528-535},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Slovenia is one of the EU countries with the largest values and largest
   amounts of variability in rainfall erosivity, with maximum annual values
   exceeding 10,000 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) yr(-1). Five-minute rainfall data
   was analysed from 10 Slovenian rainfall stations with data-length
   availability longer than 25 years with a maximum data length of 69 years
   and a total data-station length equal to 443 years. Trends in the
   rainfall erosivity R-factor were detected for four different sub-samples
   using monthly, half-year, and annual rainfall erosivity values. The
   results indicate that rainfall erosivity trends for the selected
   Slovenian stations are mostly statistically insignificant, with the
   selected significance level of 0.05. However, a larger share of
   identified trends are positive than negative. The maximum annual
   rainfall erosivity values were obtained for one specific mountain
   station. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis regarding the rainfall
   erosivity factor R calculation showed that the rainfall threshold
   parameter (12.7 mm) that is used to remove the small-magnitude rainfall
   events in order to reduce the computational burden can attribute up to
   10\% of the average annual R-values in cases where this threshold is not
   used. Other parameters have, on average, a smaller impact on the
   calculated rainfall erosivity. Furthermore, the application of local
   kinetic energy equations resulted in, on average, about 20\% higher
   annual rainfall erosivity values compared to the equation that is
   proposed by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) manual and
   was not developed specifically for this region.},

Abstract = {The unidirectional trends in rainfall and rainfall-related extremes in
   Iraq have been assessed using long-term daily rainfall data (1965-2015).
   The modified version of Man-Kendall (m-MK) test which can discriminate
   the multi-scale variability from unidirectional trend was used along
   with Mann-Kendall (MK) test to confirm the trends in the presence of
   long-term persistence (LTP). The MK test revealed decrease in annual
   number of rainy days, heavy rainfall days, and consecutive wet days at
   60, 53, and 47\% stations, respectively, and the same indices during
   winter at 47, 47, and 33\% stations, respectively. Significant decrease
   in annual and winter total rainfall was also found at a few stations. An
   increasing tendency in dry spell was observed due to the decrease in
   total rainfall and the number of rainy days; however, it was still not
   significant in most of the stations. The Student's t test and F test
   revealed significant changes in daily rainfall mean and variability
   between two 30-year periods, 1965-1994 and 1986-2015. The m-MK test
   confirmed the results obtained using the MK test in most of the
   stations. However, the number of stations with significant change was
   found to decrease when the m-MK test was used. This indicates that some
   of the significant changes estimated by MK test were due to the presence
   of LTP. The obtained results confirmed the increase in dry spells and
   droughts in the region.},

Abstract = {The relation between rainfall trend and landslide occurrences in the
   Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) is presented. This study is based
   on the availability of long-term (1931-2017) rainfall data and the
   Catalogue of Landslide OCcurrences in the Emilia-Romagna region
   (CLOCkER), which reports the date of more than 14,000 landslides from
   the Middle Ages to the present. In particular, the analyses focus on the
   role of rainfall as main triggering factor of landslides that occurred
   in the Emilia-Romagna region during the period between October 1951 and
   September 2010.
   Early findings suggest a well-defined correlation, for different
   intervals of analyses (annual, seasonal, antecedent rainfall period of
   ninety days), between the landslide occurrences recorded and the
   rainfall trend. This demonstrates that rainfall can be considered the
   main triggering factor for landslides occurring in the Emilia-Romagna

Title = {A spatio-temporal analysis of trends in rainfall from long term
   satellite rainfall products in the Sudano Sahelian zone of Nigeria},

Abstract = {Rainfall and its variability drive the rural economies across the
   Sudano-Sahelian zone of northern Nigeria, where drought strategies
   largely determine crop yields. The increasing scarcity of rain gauges in
   West Africa generally limits assessments of the degree and spatial
   extent of hardship arising from rainfall deficiency. However, the
   improved availability and robustness of satellite-based rainfall
   products since the early 1980s, offers an alternative source of rainfall
   data which is spatially, and often temporally, more complete than rain
   gauges. This research evaluates four satellite-based rainfall products
   for their ability to represent both long term rainfall trends such as
   recovery from decadal droughts, and trends in seasonal rainfall
   variables relevant to crop yield prediction. The Climate Hazards group
   Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall product at 5 km
   resolution, was observed to be consistently most representative of
   ground station rainfall across northern Nigeria over a 35-year period
   1981-2015, followed by TARCAT. CHIRPS was found to give a good overall
   prediction of rainfall amounts at dekadal, monthly and seasonal time
   scales, and was therefore used in the study to represent the typical
   performance of satellite rainfall datasets. The CHIRPS-observed increase
   in growing season length since the 1970s and 80s drought decades, was
   accompanied by significant rainfall increases in the later part of the
   growing season, especially marked in northern and northeastern states.
   This is especially important for the main subsistence crops sorghum and
   millet as the risk of late drought impedes swelling of the grain,
   affecting dry weight production. The CHIRPS data also indicate a
   significant decrease in dry spells in the northwest and southern parts
   of the study area, which would have favourable outcomes for crop
   production in the densely populated rural hinterlands of the cities of
   Sokoto, Jos and Abuja. In view of the continued intra-and inter-annual
   rainfall variability across northern Nigeria, and amid rapid rural
   population growth recently, a return to the rainfall levels of the
   drought decades, would require informed response. The study suggests
   that satellite rainfall estimates can offer such information, especially
   since we observed high spatial variability in rainfall distributions and
   trends.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the trends of extreme rainfall indices over
   northeast Bangladesh for the period of 1984 to 2016 for the pre-monsoon
   and monsoon seasons. The research was framed as part of a project
   co-producing knowledge of climate variability and impacts through
   collaboration between scientific and local communities in northeast
   Bangladesh, which found pre-monsoon and monsoon rainfall to be most
   important. With access to a greater number of rainfall stations than
   previous work in northeast Bangladesh, we investigated trends in extreme
   rainfall events using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope
   estimator. To appraise the quality of the data, we used the Standard
   Normal Homogeneity and the Pettitt tests to check its homogeneity. Among
   the seven stations, only Sunamganj was found inhomogeneous, and was not
   considered for trend analysis. All indices of rainfall extremes showed a
   decreasing trend in both seasons, with the most significant decrease
   during the monsoon. Importantly, we saw a decreasing trend in the
   seasonal total rainfall and consecutive wet days, whereas there was an
   increasing trend in consecutive dry days. Moreover, we saw a decreasing
   trend in 1-day maximum rainfall, 5-day maximum rainfall, the intensity
   of the daily rainfall over 25mm during the pre-monsoon and 50mm during
   monsoon, which together may indicate a future decrease in the magnitude
   and intensity of flash floods and monsoon floods. If this trend
   continues, the northeast Bangladesh may suffer from water stress, which
   could affect the lives and livelihoods of communities living there.},

Abstract = {This study investigates trends and the effects of the interannual and
   intraseasonal climate variability on the extreme weather of Brazil's
   capital city Distrito Federal (DF). This area is highly vulnerable to
   climate variability, having suffered from droughts and floods that
   affected the drinking water supply and agriculture. We perform trend
   analysis of 12 rainfall-related indices from 13 ground observation
   stations and assess the influence of El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO)
   and Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) on rainfall totals and extreme
   indices. The trend analysis confirms: (a) the increase of the dry spells
   length and (b) the anticipation of the onset of dry periods at regional
   level. That is also true when considering dry spells in the rainy
   season, a hazard known in the agriculture sector as veranico. On the
   other hand, extreme wet conditions became less severe in the last
   decades. Supressed monthly rainfall conditions, and some wet indices,
   are associated with La Nina episodes. The MJO's intraseasonal
   variability seems to play a substantial role in DF's climate. MJO phases
   3, 7 and 8 are associated to enhanced rainfall conditions; whereas
   rainfall is supressed during phase 5. Moreover, dry spells during the
   rainy season, or veranico, often coincide with MJO phase 5. When
   combined with ENSO, the basic response of rainfall to MJO activity
   changes substantially showing statistically significant influence of El
   Nino on phases 2 and 8; while La Nina on phases 4, 6 and 7. The findings
   contribute to a better understanding of the ongoing changes in extreme
   climate as well as the influence of natural climate variability on
   local's climate, information that can be used in the management of water
   resources and land use of DF.},

Abstract = {It is now widely accepted question that average value of the world
   temperature has gone up because of climatologically significant emission
   of greenhouse gases by means of anthropogenic sources. Global warming
   may be witnessed by changes in the frequency of occurrence of the
   extreme weather events such as severe floods, storms and drought. The
   topic of climate change is being discussed on international platforms.
   With this reference reports of Intergovernmental panel on climate change
   (IPCC) are important. In this era of climate change and global warming,
   we set the objective of this study to find out the trend and intensity
   of rainfall in the selected four stations, viz., Barielly, Lucknow,
   Allahabad and Bapatpur (Varanasi Airport) of Uttar Pradesh (UP), India
   based on hourly rainfall data. These stations are selected on better
   data availability and to represent eastern and northern part of UP.
   Firstly hourly rainfall data of all four stations ranging from 1969 to
   2014 is examined. The percentile of hourly data is calculated to define
   various intensities of hourly rainfall of the stations. Based on
   different percentiles groups, intensity of the rainfall is classified
   into very light spell, light spell, moderate spell, intense spell, very
   intense spell, extremely intense spell, exceptionally intense spell. For
   each percentile group, yearly, monthly, JJAS (monsoon) frequency
   distribution is prepared. Frequency distribution trend is analyzed by
   means oft-test, p-value, slope and R square. Statistical significance of
   the trend is done by t-test. It is found that the rainfall of different
   intensities in yearly, monthly, JJAS (monsoon) for all the four stations
   is not statistically significant. From this it may be infer that even in
   the era of climate change, the trend and intensity of hourly rainfall in
   the eastern and northern parts of UP is not changed.},

Abstract = {In the present study, an attempt has been made to analyse the
   variability and trends in annual and seasonal rainfall over the Eastern
   Ganga Canal command area, India. To determine the trend in
   annual/seasonal rainfall and rainy days, the non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test and Sen's slope method were used over daily gridded rainfall for
   the time period 1901-2012. The results of the trend analysis revealed a
   decreasing trend in annual and monsoon rainfall in the range 18.5-61.7
   and 19.4-56.7 mm/decade, respectively. For annual and monsoon rainy
   days, the results demonstrated a decreasing trend which varied from 1.8
   to 2.9 and 1.4 to 2.2 days/decade, respectively, and an increasing trend
   in the range 0.2-1.4 and 1.0 days/decade, respectively. A variability
   analysis was performed to highlight the need for selecting an
   appropriate confidence level in trend analysis. It was observed that the
   grids showing a statistically non-significant trend at the 95\%
   confidence level exhibit a statistically significant trend at lower
   confidence levels. An analysis of dry and wet years on an annual scale
   revealed that the chances of occurrence of a wet year are more in
   comparison with the chances of occurrence of a dry year in the command
   area by a ratio of 14:13. However, data from the last one and a half
   decades has a contradictory trend with higher chances of occurrence of a
   dry year to very minimal chances of occurrence of a wet year. Dependable
   rainfall at various probability levels was estimated using a gamma
   distribution function. It was observed that the 75\% dependable weighted
   annual and seasonal rainfall over the command area (985.48 and 727.54
   mm) was significantly different with respect to the climatic mean
   weighted annual and seasonal rainfall against the weighted mean annual
   and seasonal rainfall (1,165.93 and 901.95 mm).},

Abstract = {Rainfall anomaly during crop-growing season can have large impact on the
   agricultural output of a country, especially like India, where
   two-thirds of the crop land is rain-fed. In such situation, decreased
   agricultural production not only challenges food security of the country
   but directly and immediately hits the livelihood of its farming
   community. In a vast country like India, rainfall or its anomalies
   hardly follow a specific pattern, rather it is having high variability
   in spatial domain. This study focused on the trends of national and
   regional rainfall anomalies (wetness/dryness) along with their
   interrelationship using time series data of past 158years. The
   significant reducing wetness trend (p<0.05) over north mountainous India
   was prominent with an increasing trend over southern peninsular India
   (p<0.10). However, long-term annual wetness was increasing over entire
   peninsular India. The results of change point tests indicate that major
   abrupt changes occurred between early to mid-twentieth century having
   regional variations. The regional interrelationship was studied using
   principal component, hierarchical clustering, and pair-wise difference
   test, which clearly indicated a significantly different pattern in
   rainfall anomalies for north east India (p=0.022), north central India
   (p=0.022), and north mountainous India (p=0.011) from that of the all
   India. Result of this study affirmed high spatial variability in
   rainfall anomaly and most importantly established the unalike pattern in
   trends of regional rainfall vis-a-vis national level, ushering towards
   paradigm shift in rainfall forecast from country scale to regional scale
   for pragmatic planning.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of historical data of rainfall of Agra district has been
   conducted in the present study using parametric and non-parametric
   models. The analysis was carried out using 51 years data (1965-2015) of
   rain gauge station located at meteorological observatory of ICAR-Indian
   Institute of Soil and Water Conservation, Research centre, Agra, Uttar
   Pradesh. Simple statistical parameters were calculated and it was found
   that rainfall ranged from 241.4 mm to 1235.1 mm with average annual
   rainfall 671.58mm. Similarly, annual rainy days ranged from 15 to 55
   with average 38. Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope and linear regression methods
   were used for the trend analysis of rainfall and rainy days data on
   monthly, seasonal and annual basis. It was found that some of the months
   are showing rising trend whereas others showing falling trend of

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate temporal variation in seasonal
   and annual rainfall trend over Ranchi district of Jharkhand, India for
   the period (1901-2014: 113 years). Mean monthly rainfall data series
   were used to determine the significance and magnitude of the trend using
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator. The analysis
   showed a significant decreased in rainfall during annual, winter and
   southwest monsoon rainfall while increased in pre-monsoon and
   post-monsoon rainfall over the Ranchi district. A positive trend is
   detected in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon rainfall data series while
   annual, winter and southwest monsoon rainfall showed a negative trend.
   The maximum decrease in rainfall was found for monsoon (- 1.348 mm
   year(-1)) and minimum (- 0.098 mm year(-1)) during winter rainfall. The
   trend of post-monsoon rainfall was found upward (0.068 mm year(-1)). The
   positive and negative trends of annual and seasonal rainfall were found
   statistically non-significant except monsoon rainfall at 5\% level of
   significance. Rainfall variability pattern was calculated using
   coefficient of variation CV, \%. Post-monsoon rainfall showed the
   maximum value of CV (70.80\%), whereas annual rainfall exhibited the
   minimum value of CV (17.09\%), respectively. In general, high variation
   of CV was found which showed that the entire region is very vulnerable
   to droughts and floods.},

Abstract = {Rainfall exerts a controlling influence on the availability and quality
   of vegetation and surface water for herbivores in African terrestrial
   ecosystems. We analyse temporal trends and variation in rainfall in the
   Maasai Mara ecosystem of East Africa and infer their implications for
   animal population and biodiversity dynamics. The data originated from 15
   rain gauges in the Mara region (1965-2015) and one station in Narok Town
   (1913-2015), in Kenya's Narok County. This is the first comprehensive
   and most detailed analysis of changes in rainfall in the region of its
   kind. Our results do not support the current predictions of the
   International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) of very likely increases of
   rainfall over parts of Eastern Africa. The dry season rainfall component
   increased during 1935-2015 but annual rainfall decreased during
   1962-2015 in Narok Town. Monthly rainfall was more stable and higher in
   the Mara than in Narok Town, likely because the Mara lies closer to the
   high-precipitation areas along the shores of Lake Victoria.
   Predominantly deterministic and persistent interannual cycles and
   extremely stable seasonal rainfall oscillations characterize rainfall in
   the Mara and Narok regions. The frequency of severe droughts increased
   and floods intensified in the Mara but droughts became less frequent and
   less severe in Narok Town. The timings of extreme droughts and floods
   coincided with significant periodicity in rainfall oscillations,
   implicating strong influences of global atmospheric and oceanic
   circulation patterns on regional rainfall variability. These changing
   rainfall patterns have implications for animal population dynamics. The
   increase in dry season rainfall during 1935-2015 possibly
   counterbalanced the impacts of resource scarcity generated by the
   declining annual rainfall during 1965-2015 in Narok Town. However, the
   increasing rainfall extremes in the Mara can be expected to create
   conditions conducive to outbreaks of infectious animal diseases and
   reduced vegetation quality for herbivores, particularly when droughts
   and floods persist over multiple years. The more extreme wet season
   rainfall may also alter herbivore space use, including migration
   patterns.},

Abstract = {The replacement of natural forests with agriculture is generally
   associated with modifications in the hydrological behavior of a basin.
   This is particularly notable in the tropics and subtropics. Southern
   Brazil is a region with extensive agricultural production, forest
   conservation, and a vast unexplored streamflow data despite substantial
   rainfall trends observed in recent decades. In this work, we explore
   trends in the streamflow regime in the majority of the monitored basins
   in Southern Brazil. Additionally, we evaluate if pristine forested
   basins and agricultural nonforested basins have significantly different
   streamflow responses to changes in rainfall. We analyzed annual
   averages, maxima, minima, and seasonality of a 36-year data set
   (1975-2010) of 675 rainfall and 140 streamflow gauges. Results reveal
   that large trends are widespread in Southern Brazil, especially in
   basins with areas smaller than 10,000 km(2). Changes in the rainfall
   regime did not directly translate into changes in the streamflow regime.
   Changes in the annual maximum flow of forested basins were not
   statistically significant even when the annual average and maximum
   rainfall increased significantly. Correlations between changes in
   rainfall and streamflow for two indices, namely, duration of
   low-magnitude events and seasonality, were statistically significant (p
   < 0.05) only for agricultural basins. The results indicate a higher
   propagation of hydrological changes through anthropogenically modified
   systems, providing evidence that agricultural basins are more sensitive
   to changes in the rainfall regime.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the annual and seasonal rainfall variability at
   five selected stations of Amhara Regional State, by using the innovative
   trend analysis method (ITAM), Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen's slope
   estimator test. The result showed that the trend of annual rainfall was
   increasing in Gondar (Z = 1.69), Motta (Z = 0.93), and Bahir Dar (Z =
   0.07) stations. However, the trends in Dangla (Z = -0.37) and Adet (Z =
   -0.32) stations showed a decreasing trend. As far as monthly and
   seasonal variability of rainfall are concerned, all the stations
   exhibited sensitivity of change. The trend of rainfall in May, June,
   July, August, and September was increasing. However, the trend on the
   rest of other months showed a decreasing trend. The increase in rainfall
   during Kiremt season, along with the decrease in number of rainy days,
   leads to an increase of extreme rainfall events over the region during
   1980-2016. The consistency in rainfall trends over the study region
   confirms the robustness of the change in trends. Innovative trend
   analysis method is very crucial method for detecting the trends in
   rainfall time series data due to its potential to present the results in
   graphical format as well. The findings of this paper could help
   researchers to understand the annual and seasonal variability of
   rainfall over the study region and become a foundation for further
   studies.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses projected changes in short-term rainfall events
   during the warm season (April - October) in an ensemble of 30 regional
   climate model (RCM) simulations. The analysis of trend changes and
   changes in scaling exponents was done for the Hurbanovo, Bratislava,
   Oravska Lesna, and Myjava stations in Slovakia. The characteristics of
   maximum rainfall events were analysed for two scenario periods, one past
   and one future (1960-2000 and 2070-2100) and compared to the
   characteristics of the actual observed events. The main findings from
   the analysis show that 60-min short-term events for most of the RCM
   simulations will either increase or remain constant. On the other hand,
   the depths and intensities of daily events are projected to increase
   significantly; in some cases they were found to be ten times larger.
   Trends in future events at the Hurbanovo station were found to be
   insignificant. In the other stations positive trends in future rainfall
   events prevail, except for daily rainfall at the Myjava station, which
   shows a negative trend. Using results from the selected simulations, the
   scaling exponents estimated are on average lower than the exponents of
   the data observed. On the other hand, due to the higher daily
   precipitation amounts in the future seen to all the scenarios, the
   downscaled values of short-term rainfall at all the stations analysed
   might be considerably higher in the future horizons, which could
   subsequently affect future design rainfall values for engineering
   designs.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal Rainfall Trends in the Brazilian Legal Amazon between the
   Years 1998 and 2015},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Tropical forests play an important role as a reservoir of carbon and
   biodiversity, specifically forests in the Brazilian Amazon. However, the
   last decades have been marked by important changes in the Amazon,
   particularly those associated with climatic extremes. Quantifying the
   variability of rainfall patterns, hence, is essential for understanding
   changes and impacts of climate upon this ecosystem. The aim of this
   study was to analyse spatiotemporal trends in rainfall along the
   Brazilian Legal Amazon between 1998 and 2015. For this purpose, rainfall
   data derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite
   (TRMM) and nonparametric statistical methods, such as Mann-Kendall and
   Sen's Slope, were used. Through this approach, some patterns were
   identified. No evidence of significant rainfall trends (p 0.05) for
   annual or monthly (except for September, which showed a significant
   negative trend) averages was found. However, significant monthly
   negative rainfall anomalies were found in 1998, 2005, 2010, and 2015,
   and positive in 1999, 2000, 2004, 2009, and 2013. The annual
   pixel-by-pixel analysis showed that 92.3\% of the Brazilian Amazon had
   no rainfall trend during the period analysed, 4.2\% had significant
   negative trends (p 0.05), and another 3.5\% had significant positive
   trends (p 0.05). Despite no clear temporal rainfall trends for most of
   the Amazon had negative trends for September, corresponding to the peak
   of dry season in the majority of the region, and negative rainfall
   anomalies found in 22\% of the years analysed, which indicate that
   water-dependent ecological processes may be negatively affected.
   Moreover, these processes may be under increased risk of disruption
   resulting from other drought-related events, such as wildfires, which
   are expect to be intensified by rainfall reduction during the Amazonian
   dry season.},

Abstract = {This paper makes a regional evaluation of trend in yearly maxima of
   daily rainfall in southern France, both at point and spatial scales on a
   regular grid of 8 x 8 km(2). In order to filter out the high variability
   of rainfall maxima, the current analysis is based on a non-stationary
   GEV modeling in which the location parameter is allowed to vary with
   time. Three non-stationary models are considered for each series of
   maxima by constraining the location parameter to vary either linearly,
   linearly after a given date or linearly up to a final date. Statistical
   criteria are used to compare these models and select the best starting
   or final point of putative trends. The analysis shows that, at regional
   scale, the best distribution of maxima involves a linear trend starting
   in year 1985 and that this trend is significant in half the region,
   including most of the mountain ranges and part of the Rhne valley.
   Increases in yearly maxima are considerable since they reach up more
   than 60 mm/day in 20 years, which is more than 40 \% of the average
   maximum in this area.},

Abstract = {In the present study, trends of rainfall of the Central India were
   evaluated in monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales using the Revised
   Mann-Kendall (RMK) test, Sen's slope estimator, and innovative trend
   method (ITM). For this purpose, the monthly rainfall data for 20
   stations in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) states in Central
   India during 1901-2010 was used. The Sen's slope estimator was utilized
   for calculating the slope of rainfall trend line. Based on the obtained
   results of RMK test, there is no significant trend in the stations for
   the January and October months. The results also showed that for MP, two
   out of 15 considered stations indicate significant annual trend, while
   the CG has four out of five stations with significant trend. The results
   of applying ITM test indicated that most of the stations have decreasing
   trends in annual (16 stations), summer (16 stations), and monsoon (11
   stations) seasons, while the winter (12 stations) and post monsoon (11
   stations) seasons generally show increasing trend. Unlike the RMK, the
   ITM shows significant increasing trend in rainfall of November and
   December months. The finding of current study can be used for irrigation
   and water resource management purpose over the Central India.},

Title = {Trends of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> prevalence in two communities of
   Muheza district North-eastern Tanzania: correlation between parasite
   prevalence, malaria interventions and rainfall in the context of
   re-emergence of malaria after two decades of progressively declining
   transmission},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Background: Although the recent decline of malaria burden in some
   African countries has been attributed to a scale-up of interventions,
   such as bed nets (insecticide-treated bed nets, ITNs/long-lasting
   insecticidal nets, LLINs), the contribution of other factors to these
   changes has not been rigorously assessed. This study assessed the trends
   of Plasmodium falciparum prevalence in Magoda (1992-2017) and Mpapayu
   (1998-2017) villages of Muheza district, North-eastern Tanzania, in
   relation to changes in the levels of different interventions and
   rainfall patterns.
   Methods: Individuals aged 0-19 years were recruited in cross-sectional
   surveys to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infections in
   relation to different malaria interventions deployed, particularly bed
   nets and anti-malarial drugs. Trends and patterns of rainfall in Muheza
   for 35 years (from 1981 to 2016) were assessed to determine changes in
   the amount and pattern of rainfall and their possible impacts on P.
   falciparum prevalence besides of those ascribed to interventions.
   Results: High prevalence (84-54\%) was reported between 1992 and 2000 in
   Magoda, and 1998 and 2000 in Mpapayu, but it declined sharply from 2001
   to 2004 (from 52.0 to 25.0\%), followed by a progressive decline between
   2008 and 2012 (to <= 7\% in both villages). However, the prevalence
   increased significantly from 2013 to 2016 reaching >= 20.0\% in 2016
   (both villages), but declined in the two villages to <= 13\% in 2017.
   Overall and age specific P. falciparum prevalence decreased in both
   villages over the years but with a peak prevalence shifting from
   children aged 5-9 years to those aged 10-19 years from 2008 onwards. Bed
   net coverage increased from <4\% in 1998 to >98\% in 2001 and was >=
   85.0\% in 2004 in both villages; followed by fluctuations with coverage
   ranging from 35.0 to <= 98\% between 2008 and 2017. The 12-month
   weighted anomaly standardized precipitation index showed a marked
   rainfall deficit in 1990-1996 and 1999-2010 coinciding with declining
   prevalence and despite relatively high bed net coverage from 2000. From
   1992, the risk of infection decreased steadily up to 2013 when the
   lowest risk was observed (RR = 0.07; 95\% CI 0.06-0.08, P < 0.001), but
   it was significantly higher during periods with positive rainfall
   anomalies (RR = 2.79; 95\% CI 2.23-3.50, P < 0.001). The risk was lower
   among individuals not owning bed nets compared to those with nets (RR =
   1.35; 95\% CI 1.22-1.49, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: A decline in prevalence up to 2012 and resurgence
   thereafter was likely associated with changes in monthly rainfall,
   offset against changing malaria interventions. A sustained surveillance
   covering multiple factors needs to be undertaken and climate must be
   taken into consideration when relating control interventions to malaria
   prevalence.},

Abstract = {Particularly for the Himalayan region, detail rainfall climatology is
   vital for assessing climate change scenario. The primary objective of
   current study was to investigate the seasonal and annual trends of rainy
   days and rainfall intensity over Basar (Arunachal Pradesh) in
   North-eastern Himalayan region of India during 1979-2015. Secondly it
   aims to evaluate the change in contributions of light, moderate, heavy
   and very heavy rainfall towards total rainfall. Linear regression was
   used for trend analysis. During the study period, no clear, consistent
   and significant trends in total annual and seasonal rainfall was
   observed over the location, but running average indicated slow
   increasing trends, except during post-monsoon. The annual and seasonal
   rainy days show decreasing trends, though not much significant during
   southwest monsoon and post-monsoon. The study reveal appreciable
   increase in rainfall intensity both in annual and seasonal scale leading
   to increase in extreme rainfall events in the region. During the period,
   it was observed that the percentage contribution of heavy and very heavy
   rainfall intensity class towards rainfall totals has been increasing and
   that of light and moderate rainfall has been decreasing. From the study
   it is concluded that climate of the region is changing, but the erratic
   trends point towards a very unpredictable and uncertain future.},

Abstract = {Hydrogeological environment of an area includes surface and subsurface
   water resources. Groundwater is continuously getting recharged by
   surface water sources and rainfall. Recharge and discharge of an area
   can be reflected by water-table rise and drawdown. Water table of an
   area represents the groundwater strategy in the formation and majorly
   depends on the amount of precipitation. An attempt is carried out to
   analyze the correlation between rainfall and water table in arid
   climatic condition within the Gulbarga watershed, Karnataka, India.
   Rainfall and water-table data were collected from Department of Mines
   and Geology, Government of Karnataka, which consists of information from
   2001 to 2011. Month-wise data are processed into distinctive four
   seasonal data, namely winter, summer, monsoon and post-monsoon. The
   rainfall data are analyzed, and accordingly they have been classified as
   good year and bad year depending upon the amount of precipitation. The
   study focuses on the need of rainwater harvesting and artificial
   recharge structures to improve groundwater resource sustainability for
   future generation.},

Abstract = {Although drowning in rainwater tanks is a generally rare phenomenon,
   this method for suicide has been observed in parts of Croatia. Review of
   autopsy records at the University of Rijeka, Croatia, was undertaken
   from 1987 to 2016 to examine this phenomenon. Of 469 drowning deaths,
   there were 35 suicides in rainwater tanks (7.5\%). Overall drowning
   deaths showed no temporal trends. In contrast, suicidal drownings in
   rain water tanks showed a marked decline over the years, with 15 cases
   in 1987-1991, seven in 1992-1996, six in 1997-2001, six in 2002-2006,
   one in 2007-2011, and none in 2012-2016. Thus, suicidal drowning cases
   as a percentage of overall drownings dropped from 18\% to zero
   (p<0.001). This study reports a very unusual method of suicide that may
   have occurred because of the ready availability of large water
   reservoirs in homes. The recent fall in numbers may relate to less
   reliance on domestic reservoirs of water.},

Title = {Trend Detection Analysis of Seasonal Rainfall of Homogeneous Regions and

Journal = {WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-138},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {For agriculture-based country like India, seasonal rainfall is very
   crucial. Trends and variability in rainfall are one of the crucial
   aspects in studies of climate change. Earlier studies performed on the
   trend detection analysis of seasonal rainfall of homogeneous regions and
   all India (ALLIN) are having three drawbacks: (1) they have not
   considered individual month rainfall values of given season in the
   analysis, (2) they have not used smoothing curve and innovative trend
   analysis plot for supporting the results of trend detection analysis,
   and (3) they have not studied the effect of different time periods on
   the results of trend detection analysis. Thus aforesaid three research
   gaps are addressed in the present study by performing trend detection
   analysis of seasonal rainfall of ALLIN and seven homogeneous regions by
   the following: (1) considering individual month rainfall values of given
   season in the analysis, (2) use of smoothing curve and innovative trend
   analysis plot for supporting the results of trend detection analysis,
   and (3) performing trend detection analysis for three time periods
   1901-2003, 1948-2003, and 1970-2003 to study the effect of different
   time periods on the results of trend detection analysis. Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test and MK with block bootstrapping approach (MKBBS) test are used
   for assessment of statistical significance of trend present in
   independent and dependent time series, respectively. Correlogram is used
   for assessment of independence of data. Magnitude of trend is assessed
   by using SS test. Study detected presence of statistically significant
   trends in pre-monsoon rainfall time series of North West India (NWIND)
   region and monsoon rainfall time series of ALLIN and West Central India
   (WCIND) region for the time period 1948-2003.},

Title = {East Africa Rainfall Trends and Variability 1983-2015 Using Three

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Daily time series from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Africa
   Rainfall Climatology version 2.0 (ARC2), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
   Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) and Tropical Applications of
   Meteorology using SATellite (TAMSAT) African Rainfall Climatology And
   Time series version 2 (TARCAT) high-resolution long-term satellite
   rainfall products are exploited to study the spatial and temporal
   variability of East Africa (EA, 5S-20N, 28-52E) rainfall between 1983
   and 2015. Time series of selected rainfall indices from the joint
   CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices are
   computed at yearly and seasonal scales. Rainfall climatology and spatial
   patterns of variability are extracted via the analysis of the total
   rainfall amount (PRCPTOT), the simple daily intensity (SDII), the number
   of precipitating days (R1), the number of consecutive dry and wet days
   (CDD and CWD), and the number of very heavy precipitating days (R20).
   Our results show that the spatial patterns of such trends depend on the
   selected rainfall product, as much as on the geographic areas
   characterized by statistically significant trends for a specific
   rainfall index. Nevertheless, indications of rainfall trends were
   extracted especially at the seasonal scale. Increasing trends were
   identified for the October-November-December PRCPTOT, R1, and SDII
   indices over eastern EA, with the exception of Kenya. In
   March-April-May, rainfall is decreasing over a large part of EA, as
   demonstrated by negative trends of PRCPTOT, R1, CWD, and R20, even if a
   complete convergence of all satellite products is not achieved.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is one of the pivotal climatic variables, which influence
   spatio-temporal patterns of water availability. In this study, we have
   attempted to understand the interannual long-term trend analysis of the
   daily rainfall events of 2.5 mm and rainfall events of extreme
   threshold, over the Western Ghats and coastal region of Karnataka. High
   spatial resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) daily gridded rainfall
   data set of Indian Meteorological Department was used for this study.
   Thirty-eight grid points in the study area was selected to analyze the
   daily precipitation for 113 years (1901-2013). Grid points were divided
   into two zones: low land (exposed to the sea and low elevated
   area/coastal region) and high land (interior from the sea and high
   elevated area/Western Ghats). The indices were selected from the list of
   climate change indices recommended by ETCCDI and are based on annual
   rainfall total (RR), yearly 1-day maximum rainfall, consecutive wet days
   (>= 2.5 mm), Simple Daily Intensity Index (SDII), annual frequency of
   very heavy rainfall (>= 100 mm), frequency of very heavy rainfall (>=
   65-100 mm), moderate rainfall (>= 2.5-65 mm), frequency of medium
   rainfall (>= 40-65 mm), and frequency of low rainfall (>= 20-40 mm).
   Mann-Kendall test was applied to the nine rainfall indices, and
   Theil-Sen estimator perceived the nature and the magnitude of slope in
   rainfall indices. The results show contrasting trends in the extreme
   rainfall indices in low land and high land regions. The changes in daily
   rainfall events in the low land region primarily indicate statistically
   significant positive trends in the annual total rainfall, yearly 1-day
   maximum rainfall, SDII, frequency of very heavy rainfall, and heavy
   rainfall as well as medium rainfall events. Furthermore, the overall
   annual rainfall strongly correlated with all the rainfall indices in
   both regions, especially with indices that represent heavy rainfall
   events which is responsible for the total increase of rainfall.},

Abstract = {Parts of eastern Africa have experienced substantial climatic
   variability and extremes during the last few decades. Here we explore
   the extent to which local place-based knowledge is used and is relevant
   to understanding and appropriately responding to place-based climate
   variability and change (specifically rainfall) in an area of
   considerable rainfall variability in south-western Tanzania. Primary
   data were collected using focus group discussions and household
   questionnaire surveys, and secondary data obtained from government
   institutions. Various changes associated with the frequency, intensity
   and consistency of rainfall during the period 1960 to 2014 are explored.
   Findings indicate that knowledge and perceptions associated with climate
   operate at a local level, and that these are not necessarily applicable
   to neighbouring regions. Smallholder farmers in the Great Ruaha River
   Sub-Basin rely on incremental adaptations of agricultural practices, in
   response to climatic stresses which have long-term implications. We
   argue that incremental adaptations ought to be supplemented by more
   transformative changes of existing agricultural practices, such as using
   more climate-adapted crops and livestock. Moreover, caution is required
   when examining human perceptions and responses to climate variability
   and change at the site-specific scale, as such findings may not
   necessarily be applicable to broader regions in all cases.},

Abstract = {Daily gridded high-resolution rainfall data of India Meteorological
   Department at 0.25A degrees spatial resolution (1901-2015) was analyzed
   to detect the trend in seasonal, annual, and maximum cumulative rainfall
   for 1, 2, 3, and 5 days. The present study was carried out for 85 river
   basins of India during 1901-2015 and pre- and post-urbanization era,
   i.e., 1901-1970 and 1971-2015, respectively. Mann-Kendall (alpha = 0.05)
   and Theil-Sen's tests were employed for detecting the trend and
   percentage of change over the period of time, respectively. Daily
   extreme rainfall events, above 95 and 99 percentile threshold, were also
   analyzed to detect any trend in their magnitude and number of
   occurrences. The upward trend was found for the majority of the
   sub-basins for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-day maximum cumulative rainfall during
   the post-urbanization era. The magnitude of extreme threshold events is
   also found to be increasing in the majority of the river basins during
   the post-urbanization era. A 30-year moving window analysis further
   revealed a widespread upward trend in a number of extreme threshold
   rainfall events possibly due to urbanization and climatic factors.
   Overall trends studied against intra-basin trend across Ganga basin
   reveal the mixed pattern of trends due to inherent spatial heterogeneity
   of rainfall, therefore, highlighting the importance of scale for such
   studies.},

Abstract = {Understanding the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall over
   mountainous regions such as the Andes is crucial for the maintenance of
   water resources and ecosystems. This study provided a comprehensive
   analysis of the signal, statistical significance and spatial pattern of
   rainfall trends in central and southern Peruvian Andes (CSPA) from 1965
   to 2010. Rainfall from 47 quality-controlled rain gauge stations was
   examined using the hydrologic calendar year. Total and extreme rainfall
   indices proposed by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and
   Indices (ETCCDI) were calculated and trends were examined with
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. Significant regional
   patterns of changes in rainfall extremes were investigated and compared
   with previous studies. Four major regions of stations were identified
   based on principal component analysis and clustering techniques: Amazon,
   central Pacific, southern Pacific and Titicaca basins. Statistically
   significant trend patterns showed that the annual total rainfall has
   decreased in the Amazon basin, despite the increase in the number of
   rainy days and some extreme rainfall indices. Decrease in 1-day and
   5-day yearly maximum rainfall was observed in central Pacific, along
   with an increase in the number of wet days. Positive trends in indices
   related to the intensity of very strong daily rainfall were detected in
   southern Pacific. Titicaca basin showed an increase in the intensity of
   rainfall extremes. Rainfall variability and trends were evaluated during
   contrasting El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO). Most stations in the CSPA exhibited positive
   (negative) anomaly of total and extreme rainfall indices (consecutive
   dry days) during La Nina (El Nino) years. Positive (negative) anomalies
   of annual total rainfall and consecutive dry days during positive
   (negative) PDO occurred in the Amazon, southern Pacific and Titicaca
   basins, respectively. The ENSO-PDO conditions may have influenced the
   complex and mostly non-statistically significant long-term trends in
   CSPA.},

Title = {Long-Term Rainfall Trends over the Tanzania Coast},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Spatial and temporal rainfall trends over the Tanzanian coast are
   analysed and trends for over 50 years are investigated. This type of
   study is crucial at this time because the area under study is now one of
   the world's economic hotspots, as major gas fields have been discovered
   and the area also has high potential for oil field discoveries. Methods
   applied in this study include the Mann-Kendall test for rainfall data to
   detect the long-term trends, while Sen's slope estimator test was used
   for finding the magnitude of change over time. The results exhibited
   rainfall trend patterns with substantial variations between the
   stations. The Z value of the Mann-Kendall test showed various months
   with negative trend at a significance level >= 95\%. The few months that
   showed a positive trend were not statistically significant. Generally,
   rainfall trends varied in different months for different stations.
   However, the most outstanding observation on individual months is July,
   which showed a highly statistically significant (99.9\%) reduction in
   rainfall for the whole coastal area, including the regions of Mtwara,
   Dar es Salaam and Tanga. The last part of this paper describes the
   relationship between July rainfall and the horizontal winds from the
   National Centre for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for
   Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis. It is observed that the
   strength of the anticyclonic flow over the southwest Indian Ocean, which
   is associated with the westward fluxes of moisture, is responsible for
   rainfall over the whole coastal area of Tanzania during July.},

Abstract = {Understanding the effects of climate change and global warming on the
   South Asian summer monsoon rainfall trend is critically important for
   millions of inhabitants of this region. This study investigates seasonal
   (June-September) rainfall trend over the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent by
   using 36 climate model outputs from the World Climate Research
   Programme's Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5. The
   historical (1951-2005) and future (2006-2100) simulations under two
   representative concentration pathways (RCPs), RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, are
   analysed for this purpose. Model reproducibility is evaluated based on
   spatial correlation of seasonal rainfall and vertically integrated
   meridional moisture transport between simulated and observed fields. It
   is found that the majority of models shows reasonable skill in capturing
   the observed pattern of rainfall climatology and trend over the
   subcontinent. Our results showed that the models are more skilful in
   simulating seasonal mean moisture transport than trend over the Arabian
   Sea and Bay of Bengal. Of the 36 models analysed, only two models
   HadGEM2-AO and CNRM-CM5 closely approximate both the climatology and
   trend based on statistical performance metrics. Our results suggest that
   the strengthening of northwards moisture transport over the Arabian Sea
   and Bay of Bengal is a likely reason for the increasing rainfall trend
   over Indo-Pakistan subcontinent in a warmer climate. The RCP8.5
   indicates marked increase in both rainfall and moisture transport trends
   compared to RCP4.5 forcing scenario.},

Abstract = {Water is one of Ecuador's most important natural resources, whose
   management should rely on good information and adequate models for the
   water balance. Although there are many studies focusing on rainfall and
   temperatures, most of them are localized for specific projects or study
   basins. The convergence of factors like its location in the
   Intertropical Convergence Zone, the Amazon River basin, the complex
   topography of the Andes, and being next to the Pacific Ocean impacted by
   the El Nino Southern Oscillation, modelling climate in Ecuador is a
   challenging task. The aim of this research was to classify seasonal
   rainfall patterns, using robust procedures to deal with missing values
   and outliers. The selected database contained 319 stations with monthly
   rainfall from 1982 to 2011. A hierarchical clustering technique applied
   to the proportion of monthly rainfall percentiles allowed identifying
   four clusters that, when compared to a digital elevation model, resulted
   geographically related to Sierra, Coast, Amazon and Coast Orographic
   Sierra (COS). Coast shows strong seasonality with the dry season from
   June to November, while COS presents a similar pattern with moderate
   seasonality, the Amazon exhibits mild to no seasonality and the Sierra
   with a moderate seasonality. Interestingly, the Amazon seasonality
   enters rather deep into the Sierra through large river valleys.
   Cumulative differential plots of the standardized deleted deviations of
   monthly rainfall aided detecting cluster dependent El Nino effects in
   rainfall for Coast and COS. Correlations of rainfall versus SST at El
   Nino regions were also cluster dependent, with low to no significant
   correlations for Amazon, higher correlations for Coast and COS and
   moderate correlations for Sierra. Monthly rainfall trends assessed by
   the non-parametric method of Sen's slopes, showed overall decreasing
   trends for September and October rainfall and increasing from February
   to April, thus suggesting a strengthening of seasonality.},

Abstract = {Critical information on a flood-affected area is needed in a short time
   frame to initiate rapid response operations and develop long-term flood
   management strategies. This study combined rainfall trend analysis using
   Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration
   towards Evaluation ofWater Resources (APHRODITE) gridded rainfall data
   with flood maps derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
   multispectral satellite to arrive at holistic spatio-temporal patterns
   of floods in Sri Lanka. Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array
   type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) data were used to map
   flood extents for emergency relief operations while eight-day Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data
   for the time period from 2001 to 2016 were used to map long term
   flood-affected areas. The inundation maps produced for rapid response
   were published within three hours upon the availability of satellite
   imagery in web platforms, with the aim of supporting a wide range of
   stakeholders in emergency response and flood relief operations. The
   aggregated time series of flood extents mapped using MODIS data were
   used to develop a flood occurrence map (2001-2016) for Sri Lanka. Flood
   hotpots identified using both optical and synthetic aperture average of
   325 km(2) for the years 2006-2015 and exceptional flooding in 2016 with
   inundation extent of approximately 1400 km(2). The time series rainfall
   data explains increasing trend in the extreme rainfall indices with
   similar observation derived from satellite imagery. The results
   demonstrate the feasibility of using multi-sensor flood mapping
   approaches, which will aid Disaster Management Center (DMC) and other
   multi-lateral agencies involved in managing rapid response operations
   and preparing mitigation measures.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, scientific and academic researchers around the world
   have been concerned with the assessment of regional and global climate
   trends. The assessment of changes in the climate system is a planning
   tool for society as it enables the consideration of possible
   consequences from the increasing air temperature and changes in
   precipitation that have been observed around the world. Under the
   hypothesis of climate change presence in Brazil, the aim of this study
   was to verify the presence of climate trends in 243 annual data from
   Brazilian cities of maximum, minimum and average air temperatures and
   rainfall. The Mann-Kendall (M-K) and the Pettitt (Pett) tests were
   applied in order to evaluate the presence of significant trends. Maps
   were developed for the spatial visualization of the observed trends. The
   statistical results show that, from all the studied cities, increasing
   trends in maximum temperature were observed in 35\% of the series,
   decreasing in 1\% and no trends were observed in 64\%. For the minimum
   temperature, increasing trends were observed in 30\% of the studied
   series, decreasing in 8\% and no trends in 63\%. For the average
   temperature, increasing trends were observed in 35\%, decreasing in 3\%
   and no trends in 62\%. For rainfall, increasing trends were observed in
   6\%, decreasing in 4\% and no trends in 91\%. The observed trends may be
   related to the anthropic activities like urban expansion, industrial
   development and the increasing population density in each studied city.},

Abstract = {We propose in this paper a statistical framework to study the evolution
   of the co-occurrence of extreme daily rainfall in West Africa since
   1950. We consider two regions subject to contrasted rainfall regimes:
   Senegal and the central Sahel. We study the likelihood of the 3\%
   largest daily rainfall (considering all days) in each region to occur
   simultaneously and, in a 20year moving window approach, how this
   likelihood has evolved with time. Our method uses an anisotropic
   max-stable process allowing us to properly represent the co-occurrence
   of daily extremes and including the possibility of a preferred direction
   of co-occurrence. In Senegal, a change is found in the 1980s, with
   preferred co-occurrence along the E-50-N direction (i.e., along azimuth
   50 degrees) before the 1980s and weaker isotropic co-occurrence
   afterward. In central Sahel, a change is also found in the 1980s but
   surprisingly with contrasting results. Anisotropy along the E-W
   direction is found over the whole period, with greater extension after
   the 1980s. The paper discusses how the co-occurrence of extremes can
   provide a qualitative indicator on change in size and propagation of the
   strongest storms. This calls for further research to identify the
   atmospheric processes responsible for such contrasted changes in storm
   properties.

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this study, the projections of daily rainfall from an ensemble mean
   of 20 global climate models (GCMs) are used to examine projected trends
   in heavy rainfall distribution over Central Africa (CA), under the
   representative concentration pathway 8.5. For this purpose, two analyses
   periods of 40-years have been selected (2006-2045 and 2056-2095) to
   compute trends in the 90th and 99th percentiles of the daily rainfall
   distributions. We found that large increase trend is mostly found in the
   99th percentile of rainfall events, over southern Chad, northern
   Cameroon, northern Zambia, and in the Great Lakes Area. This can be
   attributed to the increase of moisture convergence intensified by the
   presence of the Congo Basin rainforest. It is also shown that the
   largest number of GCMs with a trend of the same sign as the average
   trend is observed over the above regions. It is thus clear that the
   projected increase trends in heavy rainfall events may further worse
   floods which are real problems in the CA countries. Therefore, strong
   subregional policies are needed to help design effective adaptation and
   mitigation measures for the region's countries.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of rainfall and runoff at selected locations of the basin
   can be good indicator of the flood prediction. In this study, Modified
   Man Kendall Test (MMKT) was undertaken to observe the existence of
   significant trends in the rainfall depth of both annual and monsoon
   periods for a period of 30 years (1980-2009), for six stations in the
   Jhelum River Basin (JRB) in India (viz. Srinagar, Quazigund, Pahalgam,
   Gulmarg, Kupwara and Kokernag). Besides this, the maximum and minimum
   stream flow measured at six hydrologic monitoring stations in JRB (viz.
   Sangam, Awantipora, Padshibagh, Munshibagh and Baramulla) for a period
   of 30 years (1980 to 2009) were also subjected to MMKT using a developed
   interface in MATLAB. It was observed that only Kupawara, Gulmarg and
   Kokernag stations exhibited significant decreasing trend of annual
   rainfall depth at 0.05 significance level corroborated by Sen's slope
   -12.51, -18.14 and -15.1 respectively. Whereas, the monsoon rainfall
   depth for only Kupwara showed significant decreasing trend at 0.05 level
   of significance but the magnitude of decrease was less as indicated by
   Sen's slope of -1.94 as compared to the annual rainfall depth. It was
   also observed that the decreasing trend of annual rainfall is more than
   that of the monsoon rainfall which indicated low probability of
   occurrence of flood due to rainfall in the JRB. Moreover, the Awantipora
   and Munshibagh runoff monitoring stations exhibited decreasing trend in
   the peak discharge and Baramulla, Awantipora, and Asham showed
   decreasing trend of minimum discharge at P=0.05. Nonetheless, it was
   observed that long term trend analysis of rainfall and surface runoff of
   JRB would serve as a good indicator of flood occurrences under changing
   climate.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian Southeast is considered a humid region. It is also prone
   to landslides and floods, a result of significant increases in rainfall
   during spring and summer caused by the South Atlantic Convergence Zone
   (SACZ). Recently, however, the region has faced a striking rainfall
   shortage, raising serious concerns regarding water availability. The
   present work endeavored to explain the meteorological drought that has
   led to hydrological imbalance and water scarcity in the region.
   Hodrick-Prescott smoothing and wavelet transform techniques were applied
   to long-term hydrologic and sea surface temperature (SST)-based climate
   indices monthly time series data in an attempt to detect cycles and
   trends that could help explain rainfall patterns and define a framework
   for improving the predictability of extreme events in the region.
   Historical observational hydrologic datasets available include monthly
   precipitation amounts gauged since 1888 and 1940 and stream flow
   measured since the 1930s. The spatial representativeness of rain gauges
   was tested against gridded rainfall satellite estimates from 2000 to
   2015. The analyses revealed variability in four time scale
   domains-infra-annual, interannual, quasi-decadal and inter-decadal or
   multi-decadal. The strongest oscillations periods revealed were: for
   precipitation-8 months, 2, 8 and 32 years; for Pacific SST in the
   Nio-3.4 region-6 months, 2, 8 and 35.6 years, for North Atlantic SST
   variability-6 months, 2, 8 and 32 years and for Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO) index-6.19 months, 2.04, 8.35 and 27.31 years. Other
   periodicities less prominent but still statistically significant were
   also highlighted.},

Abstract = {Land degradation in drylands has been investigated extensively over
   recent decades and several remote sensing based techniques attempt to
   decouple the human influence from the natural climate variability, but
   are contested in literature. We introduce a novel approach termed
   SeRGS-TREND that is designed to monitor land degradation by suppressing
   the impact from climate variability and highlight vegetation
   disturbances may it be human or climate-induced. SeRGS-TREND is based on
   the interpretation of the slope of a linear regression analysis within a
   sequentially moving window along the temporal axis of the time series of
   remote sensing data. The use of a moving window increases the
   probability of a statistically significant linear vegetation-rainfall
   relationship (VRR), which in turn provides an improved statistical basis
   for the results produced and thereby confidence in the assessment of
   degradation. We test and compare SeRGS-TREND and the commonly used
   RESTREND by simulating different degradation scenarios and find that
   SeRGS reveals both, more significant and more exact information about
   degradation events (e.g. starting and end point) while keeping the VRR
   correlation coefficients high, thus rendering results more reliable.},

Abstract = {This study presents a systematic analysis for identifying and
   attributing trends in the annual frequency of extreme rainfall events
   across the contiguous United States to climate change and climate
   variability modes. A Bayesian multilevel model is developed for 1244
   rainfall stations simultaneously to test the null hypothesis of no trend
   and verify two alternate hypotheses: trend can be attributed to changes
   in global surface temperature anomalies or to a combination of
   well-known cyclical climate modes with varying quasiperiodicities and
   global surface temperature anomalies. The Bayesian multilevel model
   provides the opportunity to pool information across stations and reduce
   the parameter estimation uncertainty, hence identifying the trends
   better. The choice of the best alternate hypothesis is made based on the
   Watanabe-Akaike information criterion, a Bayesian pointwise predictive
   accuracy measure. Statistically significant time trends are observed in
   742 of the 1244 stations. Trends in 409 of these stations can be
   attributed to changes in global surface temperature anomalies. These
   stations are predominantly found in the U.S. Southeast and Northeast
   climate regions. The trends in 274 of these stations can be attributed
   to El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the
   Pacific decadal oscillation, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation
   along with changes in global surface temperature anomalies. These
   stations are mainly found in the U.S. Northwest, West, and Southwest
   climate regions.},

Abstract = {Fluctuations in monthly and annual rainfall trends in the Limbang River
   Basin, Malaysia were characterized through Cramer's (t(k)) test and
   linear regression (LR) methods. Rainfall measurements from four rain
   gauging stations having 35 years (1981-2015) of data were grouped in to
   110 years non-overlapping and 15 years overlapping monthly and annual
   rainfall totals for the analysis. Analysis of monthly rainfall in the
   initial sub-periods of 10 years non-overlapping (1986-1995) indicate
   significantly decreasing trends in all rain gauging stations during the
   months January, October. December and 15 years overlapping (1981-1995
   and 1986-2000) in the months of January. March, April. October, November
   and December. Annual rainfall trend in these sub periods also confirms
   the same and suggesting dry condition in the region. During the
   sub-periods (1996-2005 and 1996-2010), the monthly and annual rainfall
   trends started showing significant increasing trends indicating wet
   condition in LRB. This period can be considered as a transition period
   in general rainfall pattern in LRB because the 10 years moving average
   rainfall also peaked above the long-term average rainfall in all
   stations. Significant increasing trend in monthly rainfall in 10 years
   non-overlapping (2006-2015) periods is associated with January, March,
   November and December whereas in 15 years overlapping period (2001-2015)
   indicate a significant increase during the months of Januaty, March,
   April, November and December. Increasing rainfall trend in monthly and
   annual total revealed by linear regression analysis shows an overall
   increase of >1000 mm annual rainfall in all rain gauging stations with
   approximately at the rate 1\% per year. However, fluctuation in annual
   rainfall indicate the influence of regional climatic phenomena on
   rainfall characteristics of LRB.},

Abstract = {Normally south west monsoon starts withdrawing from northwest India from

   provides input for forecasting excess (+20\% or more), normal (-19\% to
   +19\%) and deficient (-20\% or less) rainfall over Tamil Nadu during
   ensuing northeast monsoon. Anti cyclone, ridge, cyclonic circulation,
   trough and Col region (cyclonic flow) between 05 degrees-15 degrees N
   along east and west coast of India help in feeding moisture over Tamil
   Nadu before the start of northeast monsoon for normal and excess

Abstract = {In Japan, when a large-scale natural disaster occurs, numerous messages
   (i.e., ``tweets{''}) related to the disaster are posted on Twitter.
   Victims who need to be rescued use the hashtag \# (meaning \# Rescue) on
   the tweets to request a rescue. The effectiveness of tweets with this
   kind of hashtag has been discussed in several papers. In this paper, we
   collect and analyze tweets with the hashtag \# Rescue posted during and
   after the 2017 Northern Kyushu Heavy Rain Disaster. We also investigate
   the time trend of the tweet contents that has not been examined in
   previous papers.},

Abstract = {Trend analyses are the necessary tools for depicting possible general
   increase or decrease in a given time series. There are many versions of
   trend identification methodologies such as the Mann-Kendall trend test,
   Spearman's tau, Sen's slope, regression line, and Aen's innovative trend
   analysis. The literature has many papers about the use, cons and pros,
   and comparisons of these methodologies. In this paper, a completely new
   approach is proposed based on the crossing properties of a time series.
   It is suggested that the suitable trend from the centroid of the given
   time series should have the maximum number of crossings (total number of
   up-crossings or down-crossings). This approach is applicable whether the
   time series has dependent or independent structure and also without any
   dependence on the type of the probability distribution function. The
   validity of this method is presented through extensive Monte Carlo
   simulation technique and its comparison with other existing trend
   identification methodologies. The application of the methodology is
   presented for a set of annual daily extreme rainfall time series from
   different parts of Turkey and they have physically independent
   structure.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the spatio-temporal trends and dominant change
   points in the Regional Climate Model system (RegCM) simulations at 0.43
   degrees x 0.43 degrees resolution over Teesta river basin located in
   Sikkim. In this study, first the bias correction is done following the
   Local Intensity Scaling (LOCI) method by comparing the interpolated
   model values with the observed values of five stations for the
   historical period of 1983-2005. The estimated correction is applied to
   the interpolated future RegCM data for the rainfall projections of
   2021-2050 period under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)
   scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The historical rainfall and rainfall
   projections of the near future period of 2021-2050 are subjected to
   trend analysis using Mann-Kendall method and its sequential version
   (SQMK), Sen's slope estimator, linear trend fitting and Ensemble
   Empirical Mode Decomposition methods. The preliminary estimates using
   non-parametric tests showed a likely reversal in nature of trend in
   Gangtok and Kalimpong stations. The results of SQMK test detected
   possible trend turning points in 2030s except in future rainfall of
   Darjeeling station. The results of non-linear trend analysis showed that
   the future rainfall of Jalpaiguri shows an increasing trend while that
   of Gangtok shows decreasing trend irrespective of the two candidate RCP
   scenarios. The non-linear trend is different from linear trend in
   rainfall of Lachung and Kalimpong stations under both scenarios and that
   of Jaipalguri station under RCP8.5 scenario. The extraction of true
   shape of inherent non linear trend performed in this study may help for
   improved predictability and better management of water resources of
   Teesta river basin.},

Title = {Trend of Rainfall Indices at Kg. Kedaik Station, Pahang},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {593-600},
Abstract = {Malaysia has been constantly facing massive floods caused by excessive
   weather events during monsoon and inter-monsoon seasons. Major concerns
   on the consequences of flood include structural and erosional damage,
   loss of life and property and disruption of socio-economic activities.
   Mitigation efforts require proper planning, relying on credible
   quantification of such changes. The eastern part of Peninsular Malaysia
   is frequently affected by severe floods especially during north east
   monsoon season. Affected area includes Pahang state which is located in
   the middle and more towards the eastern part of Peninsular Malaysia. As
   such, this study examine the trend of rainfall indices to have a better
   understanding on rainfall distribution within the area. In particular,
   the performance of Gamma and Weibull distributions incorporated in
   Neyman Scott Rectangular Pulse model in reproducing rainfall indices was
   assessed at Kg. Kedaik station in Pahang. The trends of indices based on
   thirty years data were calculated and analysed using non-parametric,
   Mann Kendall test. Performance of both probability distributions was
   compared using Root Mean Square Error criteria. Results suggest that
   Gamma is the better distribution in reproducing the hourly rainfall
   series for Kg. Kedaik station. Further analysis indicate Gamma able to
   replicate the key rainfall characteristics such as the total amount of
   rainfall, mean rainfall amount on wet days or rainfall intensity,
   including the extreme indices; frequency of wet days exceeding the 95th
   percentile and rainfall intensity exceeding the 95th percentile.
   Meanwhile, the calculated trend in this study is consistent with
   previous studies, indicating the presence of positive trend at Kg.
   Kedaik station.},

   Lake Tana Basin, Ethiopia},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change and climate variability on human life have
   led the scientific community to monitor the behavior of weather and
   climate variables at different spatial and temporal scales. This paper
   explores seasonal and annual trends of rainfall in the Lake Tana basin
   (LTB) and their teleconnections with global sea surface temperatures
   (SSTs) over the period between 1979 and 2015. The nonparametric
   Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimate are applied to the rainfall
   data collected from the National Meteorology Agency (NMA) of Ethiopia
   for detecting and estimating rainfall trends. Additionally, Pearson's
   correlation coefficient method is used to determine the effect of SST
   variations on rainfall. The assessment of rainfall trends indicates that
   the amount of annual rainfall in the Lake Tana basin is increasing, but
   the rate of increase is not statistically significant. Seasonal analysis
   reveals that the smallest amount of rainfall occurs in the Bega season,
   and this season is getting drier with time. However, the analysis
   indicates that the other two seasons (Belg and Kiremt) are becoming
   wetter. The rainfall in Kiremt is increasing significantly (significant
   at the p = 0.05 level) in Debre Tabor station with a rate of 10.20
   mm/year. Besides, 78.1\% of the total annual rainfall in the basin
   occurs during this rainy (Kiremt) season, whereas Bega and Belg
   contribute some 9.4\% and 12.5\%, respectively. Furthermore, the
   correlation analysis of rainfall and SSTs indicates that rainfall of the
   LTB is highly affected by the variations of SSTs.},

Abstract = {Emerging changes in the ecosystem and global warming are among the
   humanity's most important issues in today's world. Global warming,
   melting of glaciers, rising sea water levels and irregularities in
   rainfall show the existence of these problems. The irregularities in
   rainfall are of great importance in terms of existing and planned water
   structures. Recently in our country; irregularities in averaged rainfall
   data measured over many years, declines and irregularities in the
   intensity of precipitation are frequently observed. These findings show
   that Turkey is also affected by ecosystem and global warming in
   different dimensions. Trends in rainfall intensity at stations were
   determined by using the standard duration rainfall intensity data
   obtained from the Maximum Rainfall Data observed in standard durations
   by 207 observation stations in Turkey, the observation period being over
   20 years. The data was obtained from the General Directorate of
   Meteorology. Mann Kendall and Spearman's Rho were used to identify
   trends, while Innovative Trend Analysis methods were used to determine
   dominance. Trends were determined by using Mann-Kendall and Spearman's
   Rho trend testing methods for each standard time of station data, and
   the dominance of data sets were determined by using innovative trend
   analysis. Trend and dominance maps of the stations used for each
   standard duration are prepared in the context of the determined results.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion by water is one of the main environmental concerns in the
   drought-prone Eastern Africa region. Understanding factors such as
   rainfall and erosivity is therefore of utmost importance for soil
   erosion risk assessment and soil and water conservation planning. In
   this study, we evaluated the spatial distribution and temporal trends of
   rainfall and erosivity for the Eastern Africa region during the period
   1981-2016. The precipitation concentration index, seasonality index, and
   modified Fournier index have been analysed using 5x5-km resolution
   multisource rainfall product (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
   Precipitation with Stations). The mean annual rainfall of the region was
   810mm ranging from less than 300mm in the lowland areas to over 1,200mm
   in the highlands being influenced by orography of the Eastern Africa
   region. The precipitation concentration index and seasonality index
   revealed a spatial pattern of rainfall seasonality dependent on
   latitude, with a more pronounced seasonality as we go far from the
   equator. The modified Fournier index showed high spatial variability
   with about 55\% of the region subject to high to very high rainfall
   erosivity. The mean annual R-factor in the study region was calculated
   at 3,246 +/- 1,895MJ mm ha(-1)h(-1)yr(-1), implying a potentially high
   water erosion risk in the region. Moreover, both increasing and
   decreasing trends of annual rainfall and erosivity were observed but
   spatial variability of these trends was high. This study offers useful
   information for better soil erosion prediction as well as can support
   policy development to achieve sustainable regional environmental
   planning and management of soil and water resources.},

Abstract = {A temporal rainfall analysis was carried out for the study area,
   Rajahmundry city located in lower Godavari basin, India, during the
   period 1960-2013. Both the parametric and non-parametric approaches were
   envisaged for identifying the trends at different temporal scales.
   Linear and robust regression analysis revealed a negative trend at
   weekly scale during monsoon months, but failed to signify the slope at
   95\% confidence level. The magnitude of Sen's slope was observed to be
   negative during the months of April-September. Results of the
   Mann-Kendall test ascertained the negative rainfall trends during the
   monsoon months of June and July with a significant trend at 95\%
   confidence interval. Application of robust statistics for long-term
   rainfall analysis helped to address the outlier's problem in the
   dataset. The Mann-Kendall test rejected the null hypothesis for all
   months except February-May and August after exclusion of outliers.
   Overall, a negative trend during monsoon season and a positive trend
   during post-monsoon season were observed using a robust non-parametric
   approach. Further, good correlation was found between the total rainfall
   and rainy days during the study period. On average, 21.25\% days of a
   year is considered as rainy, while heavy and extreme rainfall in this
   region together occupies nearly 15\% of the rainy days.},

Abstract = {The creation of baseline climate series is the first step towards the
   analysis of climate characteristics and behaviour in any region of the
   world. The objective of this article is to construct homogeneous
   precipitation series for the period 1982-2011, for the study of its
   spatial distribution and temporal evolution (dynamics) in the Province
   of Santa Elena, most occidental region of continental Ecuador. Data from
   22 rainfall stations at the study location enabled the construction of
   five precipitation series using statistical and correlation techniques
   to complete information gaps. Precipitations present irregular temporal
   and spatial variation throughout the year, with a wet season between
   December and May. The December-January-February (DJF) and
   March-April-May (MAM) trimesters account for 59.7 and 39.1 of annual
   rainfall. The dry season, between June and November, presents almost
   zero rainfall. Small precipitations were also identified in coastal,
   topographically low areas, with precipitations more frequent events
   towards the continental region. Throughout the years, there has been
   high variability in precipitations, with the occurrence of wet-dry
   episodes associated with the El Nino-La Nina' events, which were
   correlated with the sea surface temperature values of the Oceanic Nino
   Index. Trend analysis detected an average increase in rainfall of 2.1
   mmyear(-1) in the Province, however, the trimestral rates oscillated
   between 2.2 and 4.3 mmquart(-1). The construction of these precipitation
   series has been an important step for the spatial-temporal
   characterization of this peculiar tropical climate region that presents
   arid characteristics. These series can be applied to base scenarios for
   the development of climate studies and water resource management in the
   region.},

Abstract = {Storm-induced urban flooding is a global issue that causes large damages
   and fatalities. Characterizing extreme rainfall is critical to urban
   flood risk management. Although China's cities have been experiencing a
   rapid increase in urban flooding in recent decades, there is a lack of
   national-wide analysis of the occurrence of extreme urban rainfall. This
   study examined the trends in extreme rainfall in 146 cities in China for
   the period 1960-2014. The trends were also analysed in terms of city
   size (small, big and mega cities) in two city clusters (Jing-Jin-Jin
   City Cluster and Yangtze City Cluster). There was a strong spatial
   variation in the trends of extreme rainfall across the country, with
   negative trends in North China and positive trends in Southeast China.
   Both positive and negative trends were noted for the other regions of
   China. All the cities in Jing-Jin-Ji City Cluster had a decreasing trend
   in extreme rainfall, with a significant decline (p = 0.03) for mega
   cities. Then all cities in the Yangtze City Cluster had an increasing
   trend in extreme rainfall, with a significant increase (p=0.02) for big
   cities. The findings suggested that efforts to alleviate storm-induced
   urban flash floods should take into account both spatial disparities in
   climate and future changes in extreme rainfall events.},

Abstract = {This study investigated temporal variabilities and trends of rainfall
   and discharges in Tana River Basin in Kenya using Mann-Kendall
   non-parametric test. Monthly rainfall data from ten stations spanning
   from 1967 to 2016 and daily streamflow data time series of observations
   from 1941 to 2016 (75 years) were analyzed with the aim of capturing and
   detecting multiannual and seasonal variabilities and monotonic trends.
   The results for the datasets suggested that the streamflow is largely
   dependent on increasing rainfall at the highlands. The rainfall trends
   seemed to have been influenced by altitudinal factors. The coefficient
   of variation of the ten rainfall stations ranged from 12\% to 17\% but
   70\% of rainfall stations showed negative monotonic trends and 30\% show
   significant trends. The streamflow showed statistically significant
   upward monotonic trend and seasonal variability indicating a substantial
   change in the streamflow regime. Although the increasing trend of the
   streamflow during this period may not pose future risks and
   vulnerability of energy and irrigated agricultural production systems
   across the basin, variability observed indicates the need for enhanced
   alternative water management strategies during the low flow seasons. The
   trends and time series data indicate the potential evidence of climate
   and land use change and their impacts on the availability of water and
   sustainability of ecology and energy and agricultural production systems
   across the basin. Variability and trends of rainfall and streamflow are
   useful for planning studies, hydrological modeling and climate change
   impacts assessment within Tana River Basin.},

Abstract = {Study region: The Kara River basin, northern Togo and Benin, West
   Africa.
   Study focus: This study investigated long-term trends in annual rainfall
   (annRAIN), annual rainfall duration (DURATION) and annual maximum
   rainfall (MAXAN) for seven stations between 1950 and 2010. A Bayesian
   trend analysis was performed by fitting the Lognormal, Normal and
   Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions to annRAIN, DURATION and
   MAXAN, respectively, with a time covariate for both the location and
   scale parameters. Spatio-temporal variation of the mean decadal rainfall
   and the seasonality of the mean monthly rainfall were also analyzed.
   New hydrological insights for the region: The results indicate that the
   interannual variability of annRAIN is decreasing over time at all
   stations, and the average annRAIN is also markedly decreasing at several
   stations. However, DURATION is increasing at most stations suggesting
   that in those parts of the basin where annRAIN is decreasing, rainfall
   occurs more frequently but with less intensity. For MAXAN, evidence for
   decreasing trend is found in two stations, and for increasing trend in
   one station. It is also shown that the peak of the rainy season shifted
   from September to August since the 1980s. Furthermore, changes in the
   spatio-temporal distribution of the mean decadal rainfall are also
   observed. This study provides valuable new insights into trends
   affecting rainfall variables in the Kara River basin.},

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal structures of extreme rainfall trends in South
   Korea are investigated in the current study. The trends in the annual
   maximum rainfall series are detected and their spatial distribution is
   analyzed. The scaling exponent is employed as an index representing the
   temporal structure. The temporal structure of the annual maximum series
   is calculated and spatially analyzed. Subsequently, the block bootstrap
   based Mann-Kendall test is employed detect the trend in the scaling
   exponent series subsampled by the annual maximum rainfalls using a
   moving window. Significant trends are detected in a small number of
   stations and there are no significant trends in many stations for the
   annual maximum rainfall series. There is a large variability in the
   temporal structures of the extreme rainfall events. Additionally, the
   variations of the scaling exponent estimates for each month within a
   rainy season are larger than the variation of the scaling exponent
   estimates on an annual basis. Significant trends in the temporal
   structures are observed at many stations unlike the trend test results
   of annual maximum rainfall series. Decreasing trends are observed at
   many stations located in the coastal area, while increasing trends are
   observed in the inland area.},

Journal = {STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study examines the effect of autocorrelation on step and monotonic
   trends in seasonal and annual rainfall. Initially, for step change,
   modified-Pettitt test is applied in two ways. First, using the corrected
   and unbiased trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPWcu) approach. Second, using a
   new approach in which time series is modelled by intervention analysis
   for modified Pettitt test. Subsequently, for monotonic trends,
   Mann-Kendall (MK) and six approaches of modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test
   are applied to NCDC data for period 1901-2012 and its sub-periods.
   Approaches of MMK include pre-whitening (PW), trend-free-pre-whitening
   (TFPW), TFPWcu, two Variance Correction Approaches (VCAs) based on
   empirical formula (VCA:CF1) and Monte-Carlo-Simulations (VCA:CF2) and
   long term persistence (MK-LTP). A single change point is identified in
   1970 for annual and monsoon rainfall from original and
   modified-Pettitt's test using TFPWcu, while time series modelling
   approach has not exhibited any change point. Process shift in rainfall
   series is also studied using CUSUM and multiple change points are
   identified using Segment-Neighbourhood method. Outcomes of MMK show that
   TFPWcu is able to efficiently limit the effect of autocorrelation and
   may be preferred over PW and TFPW. The VCA:CF2 is not dependent on whole
   autocorrelation structure and corrects variance of all data series using
   lag-1 autocorrelation and may be preferred over VCA:CF1. MK-LTP
   considers long term persistence and it has exhibited presence of weaker
   trends than exhibited by other approaches. VCA:CF2 and MK-LTP are used
   to study trends of rainfall in Dehradun.},

Title = {Secular spring rainfall variability at local scale over Ethiopia: trend
   and associated dynamics},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {130},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {91-106},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Spring rainfall secular variability is studied using observations,
   reanalysis, and model simulations. The joint coherent spatio-temporal
   secular variability of gridded monthly gauge rainfall over Ethiopia,
   ERA-Interim atmospheric variables and sea surface temperature (SST) from
   Hadley Centre Sea Ice and SST (HadISST) data set is extracted using
   multi-taper method singular value decomposition (MTM-SVD). The
   contemporaneous associations are further examined using partial Granger
   causality to determine presence of causal linkage between any of the
   climate variables. This analysis reveals that only the northwestern
   Indian Ocean secular SST anomaly has direct causal links with spring
   rainfall over Ethiopia and mean sea level pressure (MSLP) over Africa
   inspite of the strong secular covariance of spring rainfall, SST in
   parts of subtropical Pacific, Atlantic, Indian Ocean and MSLP. High
   secular rainfall variance and statistically significant linear trend
   show consistently that there is a massive decline in spring rain over
   southern Ethiopia. This happened concurrently with significant buildup
   of MSLP over East Africa, northeastern Africa including parts of the
   Arabian Peninsula, some parts of central Africa and SST warming over all
   ocean basins with the exception of the ENSO regions. The east-west
   pressure gradient in response to the Indian Ocean warming led to secular
   southeasterly winds over the Arabian Sea, easterly over central Africa
   and equatorial Atlantic. These flows weakened climatological
   northeasterly flow over the Arabian Sea and southwesterly flow over
   equatorial Atlantic and Congo basins which supply moisture into the
   eastern Africa regions in spring. The secular divergent flow at low
   level is concurrent with upper level convergence due to the easterly
   secular anomalous flow. The mechanisms through which the northwestern
   Indian Ocean secular SST anomaly modulates rainfall are further explored
   in the context of East Africa using a simplified atmospheric general
   circulation model (AGCM) coupled to mixed-layer oceanic model. The
   rainfall anomaly (with respect to control simulation), forced by the
   northwestern Indian Ocean secular SST anomaly and averaged over the
   30-year period, exhibits prevalence of dry conditions over East and
   equatorial Africa in agreement with observation. The atmospheric
   response to secular SST warming anomaly led to divergent flow at low
   levels and subsidence at the upper troposphere over regions north of 5(A
   degrees) S on the continent and vice versa over the Indian Ocean. This
   surface difluence over East Africa, in addition to its role in
   suppressing convective activity, deprives the region of moisture supply
   from the Indian Ocean as well as the Atlantic and Congo basins.},

Abstract = {Satellite-derived estimates of precipitation are essential to compensate
   for missing rainfall measurements in regions where the homogeneous and
   continuous monitoring of rainfall remains challenging due to low density
   rain gauge networks. The Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed
   Information using Artificial Neural NetworksClimate Data Record
   (PERSIANN-CDR) is a relatively new product (released in 2013) but that
   contains data since 1983, thus enabling long-term rainfall analysis. In
   this work, we used three decades (1983-2014) of PERSIANN-CDR daily
   rainfall data to characterize precipitation patterns in the southern
   part of the Amazon basin, which has been drastically impacted in recent
   decades by anthropogenic activities that exacerbate the spatio-temporal
   variability of rainfall regimes. We computed metrics for the rainy
   season (onset date, demise date and duration) on a pixel-to-pixel basis
   for each year in the time series. We identified significant trends
   toward a shortening of the rainy season in the southern Amazon, mainly
   linked to earlier demise dates. This work thus contributes to monitoring
   possible signs of climate change in the region and to assessing
   uncertainties in rainfall trends and their potential impacts on human
   activities and natural ecosystems.},

Abstract = {This study attempt to examine the changing rainfall characteristics in
   Guinea Savanna of Nigeria. In view of the aim and targeted objectives,
   rainfall was carefully looked at on monthly and annual basis in brief
   and ecological spatial scales with data from 1980 to 2014. The study
   considered 12 stations which represent the area. Basic descriptive
   statistics like the mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation
   including other inferential statistics such as linear regression, and
   standardized anomaly were successfully utilized. Variables analyzed
   include monthly and annual rainfall amount and number of rain days.
   Geostatistical analysis was employed mainly for spatial analysis in
   geographical information system (GIS) environment. Highest coefficient
   of variation of rainy days in Northern Guinea occurs in Yola 37\% while
   highest in Ilorin in the Southern Guinea is 12.19\%. The coefficient of
   determination - (R-2) of annual rainfall amount and rainy days were 66,
   56, 63, 73 and 41\% for Ibi, Abuja, Lokoja, Makurdi and Lafia
   respectively. It was generally discovered that rainfall shows variation
   temporally. The high variations of rainfall at higher latitudes reveal
   the unreliable nature of rainfall as one progresses towards Northern
   Guinea and vice versa. This results will enable policy makers and
   general public particularly farmers to understand the rainfall
   variability so as to adapt strategies like irrigation schemes for food
   security. This work will also help government to establish more
   effective meteorological stations at micro level to have dense network
   of stations for more accurate results.},

Abstract = {Globally, climate change and extreme weather events are occurring more
   frequently, impacting water resources and farming systems. Therefore,
   spatio-temporal analysis of long-term rainfall is much needed to
   understand the variability of rainfall occurrence. The present study
   attempts to analyse spatio-temporal rainfall change scenarios in the
   20th century (1901-2000) over Bundelkhand, one of the drought hit
   regions of India. Analysis shows that major rainfall contributed from 3
   months, i.e. July, August and September. However, decreasing rainfall
   trend during monsoon season and increasing trend during pre-monsoon and
   post-monsoon season indicates the scenario of shifting rainfall from
   normal occurrence. This result is supported by decreasing seasonality
   index (SI) (1.94-1.1). The northern part of the region witnessed
   positive annual and monsoon rainfall trend but the southern part
   observed negative trend. Pettitt's test indicates 1983 is the most
   probable change year with 0.95 probability, after which annual and
   monsoon rainfall was found decreasing. Wavelet analysis revealed that
   extreme rainfall occurrence was observed with a periodicity of 2-16
   years. However, Bundelkhand rainfall pattern depicts declining rainfall
   trends, heading towards a further drier phase with more irregular
   rainfall in the coming era. The study will serve as future reference in
   similar regions in the world to determine vital weather patterns which
   may impact farming systems.},

Title = {Increasing trends in rainfall-runoff erosivity in the Source Region of
   the Three Rivers, 1961-2012},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {592},

Abstract = {As the head source of the two longest rivers in China and the longest
   river in Southeast Asia, the East Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is
   experiencing increasing thaw snowmelt and more heavy precipitation
   events under global warming, which might lead to soil erosion risk. To
   understand the potential driving force of soil erosion and its
   relationship with precipitation in the context of climate change, this
   study analyzed long-term variations in annual rainfall-runoff erosivity,
   a climatic index of soil erosion, by using the Mann-Kendall statistical
   test and Theil and Sen's approach in the Source Region of the Three
   Rivers during 1961-2012. The results showed the followings: (i)
   increasing annual rainfall-runoff erosivity was observed over the past
   52 years, with a mean relative trend index (RT1) value of 12.1\%. The
   increasing trend was more obvious for the latest two decades: RT1 was
   nearly three times larger than that over the entire period; (ii) more
   precipitation events and a higher precipitation amount were the major
   forces for the increasing rainfall-runoff erosivity; (iii) similar
   rising trends in sediment yields, which corresponded to rainfall-runoff
   erosivity under slightly increasing vegetation coverage in the study
   area, implied a large contribution of rainfall-runoff erosivity to the
   increasing sediment yields; and (iv) high warming rates increased the
   risk of soil destruction, soil erosion and sediment yields. Conservation
   measures, such as enclosing grassland, returning grazing land to
   grassland and rotation grazing since the 1980s, have maintained
   vegetation coverage and should be continued and strengthened. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Climate change in the Amazon region is the subject of many studies not
   only due to its stance as an emblematic ecosystem but also as a region
   where changes have been dramatic for over 30 years, mainly due to
   deforestation. We investigate how people settled in the Amazon perceive
   environmental changes by comparing these perceptions with satellite
   rainfall data for 12 sites representing the community diversity in the
   region. Perceptions are varied and agreement with physical, measured
   data is not always good. However, the arc of deforestation, where the
   downward trend of rainfall is more strongly observed, also appears as
   the region where the populations have the highest perception of rainfall
   change.},

Abstract = {In this study, 60-year monthly rainfall data of Bangladesh were analysed
   to detect trends. Modified Mann-Kendall, Spearman's rho tests and Sen's
   slope estimators were applied to find the long-term annual, dry season
   and monthly trends. Sequential Mann-Kendall analysis was applied to
   detect the potential trend turning points. Spatial variations of the
   trends were examined using inverse distance weighting (IDW)
   interpolation. AutoRegressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model
   was used for the country mean rainfall and for other two stations data
   which depicted the highest and the lowest trend in the Mann-Kendall and
   Spearman's rho tests. Results showed that there is no significant trend
   in annual rainfall pattern except increasing trends for Cox's Bazar,
   Khulna, Satkhira and decreasing trend for Srimagal areas. For the dry
   season, only Bogra area represented significant decreasing trend.
   Long-term monthly trends demonstrated a mixed pattern; both negative and
   positive changes were found from February to September. Comilla area
   showed a significant decreasing trend for consecutive 3 months while
   Rangpur and Khulna stations confirmed the significant rising trends for
   three different months in month-wise trends analysis. Rangpur station
   data gave a maximum increasing trend in April whereas a maximum
   decreasing trend was found in August for Comilla station. ARIMA models
   predict +3.26, +8.6 and -2.30 mm rainfall per year for the country,
   Cox's Bazar and Srimangal areas, respectively. However, all the test
   results and predictions revealed a good agreement among them in the
   study.},

   used to identify trends and the Theil-Sen's slope method to estimate
   magnitude of trend line. Sequential Mann Kendall test was also applied
   to detect the potential turning point. Results found significant
   decreasing precipitation trend in annual andmonsoon season over the
   basin except the southeastern part. The maximum decrease was found for
   annual and monsoon season at the northwestern part while minimum at the
   northeastern region. The sequential Mann Kendall test identified several
   non-significant as well as significant turning points for seasonal and
   annual rainfall at most of the locations.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate rainfall trends in chosen
   climatic stations in Syria. Syria is prone to extreme climate events
   such as drought and flood. Annual as well as seasonal rainfall trends

   applied to identify the magnitude of those trends. The results achieved
   for rainfall revealed more frequent significant decreasing trends.
   Achieved results can be the basis for the development of water resources
   management plans and within the framework of risk assessment they will
   address all aspects of risk management focusing on prevention,
   protection, preparedness (including forecasts and early warning systems)
   and taking into account the characteristics of specific area. The
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment
   Report concluded that precipitation has generally increased over
   latitudes north of 30 over the period of 1900-2005 and decrease in the

Abstract = {In this paper the long term trend of annual and seasonal rainfall over
   different districts, Meteorological (Met.) sub-divisions and whole India
   have been studied using the long term rainfall data for the period from
   1901 to 2013. The changes in amount and pattern of rainfall have a
   significant impact on agriculture, water resources management and
   overall economy of the country. Mann-Kendall test is applied to check
   the significance of the trend. Linear Regression and Theil-Sen's non
   parametric test has been applied to estimate the trend. The study is
   carried out for 632 districts and 34 sub divisions of India by utilizing
   the gridded rainfall data (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) over the main
   land except Andaman \& Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands. Many authors
   have studied that extreme events are increasing but there is no trend in
   Pan India's rainfall. It is observed from the annual rainfall analysis
   10\% of the number of districts are showing significant increasing trend
   and 13\% significant decreasing (mainly in Uttar Pradesh) trend whereas
   irrespective of high and low rainfall regions, 10\% area of the country
   is showing significant increasing trend and 8\% of the area of the
   country showing significant decreasing trend in annual rainfall. In
   Meteorological Sub divisions, east \& west UP are showing significant
   negative trend and some of the coastal sub divisions are showing
   positive trend. It is also observed that the country's rainfall is not
   showing any trend.},

Abstract = {Asset selection and timing decisions are major investment concerns. To
   resolve these issues simultaneously, a new class of rainbow trend
   options is proposed. The diversification effect of rainbow options can
   reduce the importance of asset selection decisions and trend options can
   mitigate unfavorable effects on market entry and exit decisions. We
   consider a general framework to facilitate the derivation of analytic
   pricing formulas for simple, pure, and Asian rainbow trend options using
   the martingale pricing method. The properties of these options and their
   Greeks are analyzed. We also investigate the performance of the dynamic
   delta hedging strategy for issuers of rainbow trend options. Last, this
   paper explores the applications of rainbow trend options for hedging
   price risks, designing executive stock options, modifying
   countercyclical capital buffer proposed by Basel Committee, and acting
   as control variates of the Monte Carlo simulation.},

Abstract = {The study of regional rainfall trends over South Asia is critically
   important for food security and economy, as both these factors largely
   depend on the availability of water. In this study, South Asian summer
   monsoon rainfall trends on seasonal and monthly (June-September) time
   scales have been investigated using three observational data sets. Our
   analysis identify a dipole-type structure in rainfall trends over the
   region north of the Indo-Pak subcontinent, with significant increasing
   trends over the core monsoon region of Pakistan and significant
   decreasing trends over the central-north India and adjacent areas. The
   dipole is also evident in monthly rainfall trend analyses, which is more
   prominent in July and August. We show, in particular, that the
   strengthening of northward moisture transport over the Arabian Sea is a
   likely reason for the significant positive trend of rainfall in the core
   monsoon region of Pakistan. In contrast, over the central-north India
   region, the rainfall trends are significantly decreasing due to the
   weakening of northward moisture transport over the Bay of Bengal. The
   leading empirical orthogonal functions clearly show the strengthening
   (weakening) patterns of vertically integrated moisture transport over
   the Arabian Sea (Bay of Bengal) in seasonal and monthly interannual time
   scales. The regression analysis between the principal components and
   rainfall confirm the dipole pattern over the region. Our results also
   suggest that the extra-tropical phenomena could influence the mean
   monsoon rainfall trends over Pakistan by enhancing the cross-equatorial
   flow of moisture into the Arabian Sea.},

Title = {Trends of climate changes in the rainfall in river basins of the state

Abstract = {Several studies have shown that the increasing of planet's average
   temperature causes an intensification of the hydrological cycle, which
   may lead to changes in rainfall regimes, such as increasing of the
   occurrence of extreme hydrological events, modifying the water
   availability of a region and the quality of life of its population. The
   trend analysis of time series of rainfall is one of the ways to
   determine the occurrence of local climate changes. In this context, this
   work aims to estimate the trend in rates of climate change detection,
   referring to daily rainfall, defined by World Meteorological
   Organization (WMO), using the software RClimDex, and to evaluate the
   implications of these trends in river basins of the state of Pernambuco.
   For this, 75 rain gauge stations uniformly distributed along the state,
   varying from 1962 to 2011, with about 50 years of data, were used.
   Several trends in detection rates of climate change in the basins of
   Goiana, Capibaribe, Ipojuca, Sirinhaem, Una, Mundau, Ipanema, Moxoto,
   Terra Nova, Brigida, Garcas e Pontal were observed. It was concluded
   that there is evidence of climate variability for some of its major
   river basins: it was verified evidence of acceleration in the process of
   dryness of the river basins of Ipanema, Brigida and Garcas, and it was
   observed a higher tendency of occurrence of extreme rainfall events for
   the basins of Mundau, Sirinhaem and Garcas.},

Title = {Trends and projections of Southern Hemisphere baroclinicity: the role of
   external forcing and impact on Australian rainfall},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {48},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {3261-3282},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Changes in the characteristics of Southern Hemisphere (SH) storms, in
   all seasons, during the second half of the twentieth century, have been
   related to changes in the annual cycle of SH baroclinic instability. In
   particular, significant negative trends in baroclinic instability, as
   measured by the Phillips Criterion, have been found in the region of the
   climatological storm tracks; a zonal band of significant positive trends
   occur further poleward. Corresponding to this decrease/increase in
   baroclinic instability there is a decrease/increase in the growth rate
   of storm formation at these latitudes over this period, and in some
   cases a preference for storm formation further poleward than normal.
   Based on model output from a multi-model ensemble (MME) of coupled
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, it is shown that these
   trends are the result of external radiative forcing, including
   anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, aerosols and land-use change. The
   MME is used in an analysis of variance method to separate the internal
   (natural) variability in the Phillips Criterion from influences
   associated with anomalous external radiative forcing. In all seasons,
   the leading externally forced mode has a significant trend and a loading
   pattern highly correlated with the pattern of trends in the Phillips
   Criterion. The covariance between the externally forced component of SH
   rainfall and the leading external mode strongly resembles the MME
   pattern of SH rainfall trends. A comparison between similar analyses of
   MME simulations using the second half of the twenty-first century of the
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios
   show that trends in the Phillips Criterion and rainfall are projected to
   continue and intensify under increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   concentrations.},

Title = {Evaluating persistence and identifying trends and abrupt changes in
   monthly and annual rainfalls of a semi-arid region in Western India},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this study, 43-year (1965-2007) monthly and annual rainfall time
   series of ten rainfall stations in a semi-arid region of western India
   are analyzed by adopting three tests for testing normality and by
   applying autoregressive technique for exploring persistence. Gradual
   trends are identified by three tests, and their magnitudes are assessed
   by the Sen's slope estimator. Also, abrupt changes are detected by using
   four tests and they are further confirmed by two tests. Box-whisker
   plots revealed that the rainfalls of June and September are right skewed
   for all the stations. The annual rainfalls of Bhinder, Dhariawad, and
   Gogunda stations are found considerably right skewed. The normality
   tests indicated that the rainfall of July does not deviate from the
   normal distribution at all the stations. However, the annual rainfall is
   found non-normal at five stations. The monthly rainfalls of June, July,
   and August have persistence respectively at three (Mavli, Salumber, and
   Sarada), two (Kherwara and Sarada), and one (Mavli) stations, whereas
   the annual rainfall has persistence at Girwa and Mavli stations.
   Significantly increasing trend is detected at Mavli in the rainfall of
   July and in the annual rainfall (p value > 0.05), while the negative
   trend in August rainfall at Dhariawad is found significant (p value >
   0.10). This study revealed that the presence of serial correlation does
   not affect the performance of the Mann-Kendall test. Mean values of
   trend magnitudes for the rainfalls of June, July, August, and September
   are 0.3, 0.8, -0.4, and 0.4 mm year(-1), respectively, and the overall
   mean value for the annual rainfall is 0.9 mm year(-1). It is found that
   the standard normal homogeneity test and the Pettitt test are biased
   towards the end of the series to locate a change point. Conversely, the
   Bayesian test has a tendency to look for a change point in the beginning
   of time series. Confirmed abrupt changes in the rainfall time series are
   found in the year 2003 (Bhinder) in June; years 1974 (Mavli) and 1989
   (Dhariawad and Salumber) in July; years 1972 (Sarada), 1990 (Dhariawad),
   and 2003 (Mavli) in August; years 1977 (Dhariawad), 1991 (Sarada), and
   2004 (Kotra) in September; and in the year 1972 (Mavli and Sarada
   stations) in the annual series. It is emphasized that the significantly
   increasing trend of rainfall may have linkages with climate change
   and/or variability. Finally, this study recommends use of multiple
   statistical tests for analyzing hydrologic time series in order to
   ensure reliable decisions.},

Title = {Seasonality of the Observed Amplified Sahara Warming Trend and
   Implications for Sahel Rainfall},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3073-3094},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Prior results indicate an amplified annual mean warming trend over the
   Sahara, with temperature trends that are 2-4 times that of the tropical
   mean rate. Trend analysis is conducted using five atmospheric reanalyses
   and three observational datasets to better understand the seasonality
   and physical processes of this amplified warming and the implications
   for Sahel precipitation. The seasonality of the amplified warming is
   maximum during July-October with a minimum during June. Two processes
   related to the amplified warming are identified. A ``dry process''
   supports amplified warming over the Sahara when there is limited latent
   heating and/or evaporation to cool the surface and distribute heat to
   the atmosphere. In this mechanism, the warming results from changes in
   the upward longwave and downward longwave fluxes that are tightly
   coupled to each other. The second, termed a ``wet process,'' occurs
   during the summer West African monsoon season. In this mechanism there
   are increases in the low-and midlevel atmospheric moisture over the
   Sahara that add to the surface warming by increasing the longwave
   downward radiation. This additional atmospheric moisture is transported
   over the Sahara because of a strengthening of the thermal low/Saharan
   high circulation system. A positive feedback mechanism is discussed in
   which enhanced moisture transport due to the stronger Saharan warming
   leads to increased Sahel rainfall that further strengthens the
   meridional temperature and height gradients by cooling the Sahel
   surface, further enhancing moisture transport into the region. Both
   processes contribute to the amplified warming, with the amplification
   being greater during the summer.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to examine the trends in magnitude and
   intensity of precipitation and peak floods of different magnitudes for
   seven major river basins in India. Data pertaining to daily flows for
   about 30-odd years and precipitation for 61 years (from 1951 to 2012)
   were analysed. Linear trends were calculated for the number of rainy
   days, rainfall intensity and occurrence of flood peaks for all basins.
   Using the Sen's slope estimator, it was found that annual peak rainfall
   increases for most of the basins in India. From the Mann-Kendall test
   and Sen's slope, it was found that the Cauvery and Brahamani and
   Baitarani basins show a rising trend in the number of rainy days, but
   the trend was falling for five other basins. When the basins were
   classified as mountains and plains, it was found that the number of
   daily rainfall events of different magnitudes was more in the mountains
   compared to the plains. The rivers which flow from west to east
   direction have more rainy days compared to those which flow towards the
   west. It was observed that in general the number of rainy days was
   falling while the number of intense events was increasing. The number of
   flood peaks of smaller magnitude in different decades showed slight
   falling trend. It was also found that there was falling or no trend for
   severe floods. Anthropogenic activities (construction of storage
   reservoirs, diversions, urbanization, land-use change, and soil and
   water conservation measures, etc.) have probably affected the generation
   of peak floods in the rivers of India. River regulation through storage
   reservoirs in the past 50 years has resulted in the reduction of peak
   flows. Hence with the same rainfall, the flood peaks would have
   increased under virgin conditions.},

Abstract = {Accurately predicting precipitation trends is vital in the economic
   development of a country. Ground observed data from the Nigeria
   Meteorological Agency (NIMET) was analyzed to study the long-term
   spatio-temporal trends of rainfall on annual and seasonal scales for 23
   stations in Nigeria during a 40-year period spanning from 1974 to 2013.
   After testing the presence of autocorrelation, Mann-Kendall (modified
   Mann-Kendall) test was applied to non-autocorrelated (autocorrelated)
   series to detect the trends in rainfall data. Theil and Sen's slope
   estimator test was used to find the magnitude of change over a time
   period. Pettitt's test, Standard Normal Homogeneity Test, and Buishand's
   test were further used to test the homogeneity of the rainfall series.
   The results show an increasing trend in annual rainfall; however, only
   nine stations have a significant increase during the period of study. On
   the seasonal time scale, a significant increasing trend was observed in
   the pre- and post-monsoon seasons, while only nine stations show a
   significant increasing trend in monsoon rainfall and a significant
   decreasing trend in the winter rainfall over the last 40 years. During
   the study period, 15.4 and 13.90 \% increase were estimated for annual
   and monsoonal rainfall, respectively. Furthermore, seven stations
   exhibit changes in mean rainfall while majority of the stations
   considered (Eighteen stations) exhibit homogeneous trends in annual and
   seasonal rainfall over the country. The performance of the different
   tests used in this study was consistent at the verified significance
   level.},

Title = {Spatial trend analysis of Hawaiian rainfall from 1920 to 2012},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Spatial patterns of rainfall in Hawaii are among the most diverse in the
   world. As the global climate warms, it is important to understand
   observed rainfall variations to provide context for future changes. This
   is especially important for isolated oceanic islands where freshwater
   resources are limited, and understanding the potential impacts of
   climate change on the supply of freshwater is critical. Utilizing a
   high-resolution gridded data set of monthly and annual rainfall for
   Hawaii from January 1920 to December 2012, seasonal and annual trends
   were calculated for every 250-m pixel across the state and mapped to
   produce spatially continuous trend maps. To assess the stability of
   these trends, a running trend analysis was performed on 34 selected
   stations. From 1920 to 2012, over 90\% of the state experienced drying
   trends, with Hawaii Island, and in particular the western part of the
   island, experiencing the largest significant long-term declines in
   annual and dry season rainfall. The running trend analysis highlighted
   the multi-decadal variability present in these trends, and revealed that
   the only region in the state with persistent annual and dry season
   trends through the study period is the western part of Hawaii Island;
   for most other regions, the drying trends were not significant until the
   most recent part of the record was included. These results support
   previous studies that indicate drying across the state over recent
   decades, and reveal the timing of upward and downward trends as well as
   important spatial details for natural resource management in Hawaii.},

Volume = {182},

Abstract = {Rainfall analyses are essential to evaluate the risk of soil erosion by
   water. Seasonality and concentration of precipitation need to be
   considered in the assessment of erosive potential of the rainfall.
   Spatial variations and trends in annual rainfall, seasonality and
   rainfall erosivity, have been studied in this work for the Western
   region of Andalusia in order to improve the analysis of soil degradation
   associated with erosivity and to determine potential alterations related
   to climate change. The present study is based on data from monthly
   rainfall recorded in the period 1945 to 2005 in a total of 225
   rain-gauge stations spread all over region. Rainfall seasonality has
   been obtained by means of the use of two seasonality indices: (i) the
   Walsh and Lawler index (SI) and (ii) the precipitation concentration
   index (PCI). Soil erosion risk has been determined estimating the
   erosivity by the Modified Fournier Index (MFI). For each year, the SI,
   PCI, MFI, and precipitation values for different seasons (fall, winter,
   spring, summer, fall-winter, and spring-summer) were calculated. The
   time-series trend of the annual and seasonal precipitation and the
   annual values of the SI, PCI, and MFI indices have been examined by
   using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test. The results show a marked
   seasonality in the rainfall. A small, although relevant, fraction of the
   area has a high erosivity index. Finally, a decreasing trend in the
   spring-summer rainfall has been detected in 72\% of the rain gauges
   considered.},

Title = {Historical rainfall trends in South Africa: 1921-2015},
Journal = {WATER SA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {285-297},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to update the analysis of historical rainfall
   trends with reference to the work from previous studies, through
   optimizing the highest spatial resolution with the longest possible
   period of analysis, i.e., 1921-2015. Two interlinked datasets, namely
   the district rainfall and individual rainfall stations datasets were
   used for the trend analyses, namely, daily time series of 60 individual
   rainfall stations and the daily district rainfall of 88 of 94 rainfall
   districts in South Africa. The extreme precipitation indices defined by
   the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Climate Change
   Detection and Indices were applied. In general, the results show an
   increase in rainfall for most rainfall stations in the southern interior
   of South Africa, and indications of decreases in rainfall in the far
   northern and north-eastern parts. The increase in the annual rainfall in
   the south is reflected in the seasonal trends, where summer rainfall
   shows a similar increase, but also extends into the central interior.
   For other seasons, most of the country shows no significant historical
   trends in annual total rainfall. From the extreme rainfall analyses, an
   increase in daily rainfall extremes in the southern to western interior
   is apparent. Also, most of the country experienced increases in the
   intensity of daily rainfall, which confirms global results in general.
   Decreases in rainfall from wet spells were noted in most places over the
   east and north-east, while the southern and eastern parts along the
   escarpment experienced shorter annual dry spells. This study improves on
   previous studies in the region by more than doubling the analysis
   period, largely eliminating the influence that decadal-scale cycles
   might have on analyses over shorter periods. However, some differences
   in the trend results compared to previous studies are apparent, e.g.,
   less pronounced drying in the east and the previously observed increase
   in rainfall in the western and southern interior not extending as far as
   the south-western Cape. The observed trends broadly confirm those of
   projected changes in summer rainfall, i.e., an increase in the west and
   decrease in the east.},

Abstract = {On the basis of past 115 years (1901-2015) rainfall data of five
   districts of south Gujarat, the Mann Kendall trend, Sen's slope and
   regression slope showed that annual and monsoon rainfall at Valsad, Dang
   and Surat shows the increasing trend while, that of Naysari and Bharuch
   districts are declining. The monsoon season (summer monsoon) rainfall
   variability of Valsad, Dang, Surat, Naysari and Bharuch districts was
   recorded is 30.1\%, 30.9\%, 35.9\%. 33.3\% and 38.6\%. The high
   coefficient of variation (CV) denoted that the variability of rainfall
   is not equally distributed and the amount of rainfall is lowest. The
   Bharuch district the annual and monsoon CV per cent denoted that the
   variability of rainfall in both seasons are very high. Valsad was
   recorded lowest CV with highest rainfall while the data are represent
   that variability of rainfall which can varies Bharuch to Dang in
   different districts of south Gujarat. The data shows that Dang district
   comes under high rainfall and Bharuch under low rainfall on south
   Gujarat. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to
   be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation
   indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of
   values. Similarly high SD is reported at Dang district because of high
   range of rainfall and lowest SD is found at Bharuch district because of
   low rainfall variability. The rainfall distribution different season
   viz., pre monsoon, monsoon post monsoon and winter season, the highest
   present contribution of rainfall is observed during monsoon season
   followed by post monsoon in all the five districts of south Gujarat.
   Rainfall contribution during remaining months was less than one per
   cent. While month wise analysis shows during monsoon season highest
   rainfall per cent contribution to annual rainfall is in July followed by
   August and June months at all the five districts of south Gujarat.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at identification of abrupt change points (CPs) and
   detection of gradual trends in 34-year (1980-2013) annual rainfall at
   nine stations of an Indian arid region. The CPs were determined by five
   tests and their significance was examined by two tests. Furthermore,
   trends were tested by three tests and their magnitudes were quantified
   by two tests. Novelty of the study lies in investigating significance of
   trends sequentially over years by applying Mann-Kendall (M-K) test. The
   identified CPs were similar for standard normal homogeneity test and
   cumulative deviations test at most stations. In contrast, Pettitt and
   Bayesian tests detected CP in years 2002 and 2005 at six and three
   stations, respectively, and their significance was verified. Results of
   sequential M-K test did not match with other tests' results. The mean
   annual rainfall after CP (350-627 mm) increased by 14-80\% of the amount
   before CP (306-444 mm) with 7-42\% reduction in coefficient of
   variation. The box-whisker plots supported these findings. Results of
   trend tests indicated statistically significant trends at Anjar,
   Bhachau, Mandvi and Rapar. Trend magnitudes by linear regression prior
   to CP (-6.2 to 7.1 mm year(-1)) showed an overall increase after CP
   (4.7-40.8 mm year(-1)) with negative trend at one station. Sen's slope
   test, showing good harmony with linear regression, revealed that trend
   magnitudes after CP were 2-10 times higher than that for 34-year period
   at six stations. Results of M-K test applied for sequential periods
   emphasized that rainfall trends are becoming stronger over time. This
   finding suggests that significance level of increasing rainfall trends
   may further increase in future. Finally, findings of this study are
   useful for planners and decision makers for developing policies to meet
   the challenges of the heightened rainfall in study area. Also, the
   approach used here may be adopted in other parts of the globe.},

Abstract = {Understanding rainfall trend can be a first step in the planning and
   management of water resources especially at the basin scale. In this
   study, standard tests are used to examine rainfall trends based on
   monthly, seasonal and mean annual series at the Niger-South Basin,
   Nigeria, between 1948 and 2008. Rainfall variability index showed that
   the decade 2000s was the driest (-2.1), while 1950s was the wettest
   (+0.8), with the decade 1980s being the driest in the second half of the
   last century, whereas the year 1983 was the driest throughout the
   series. Over the entire basin, rainfall variability was generally low,
   but higher intra-monthly than inter-annually. Annual rainfall was
   dominated by August, contributing about 15\%, while December contributed
   the least (0.7\%). On a seasonal scale, July-August-September (JJA)
   contributed over 40\% of the annual rainfall, while rainfall was lowest
   during December-January-February (DJF) (4.5\%). The entire basin
   displayed negative trends but only 15\% indicated significant changes
   (alpha < 0.1), while the magnitudes of change varied between -3.75 and
   -0.25 mm/yr. Similarly, only JJA exhibited insignificant upward trend,
   while the rest showed negative trends. About eight months of the year
   showed reducing trends, but only January trend was significant. Annual
   downward trend was generally observed in the series. The trend during
   1948-1977 was negative, but it was positive for the 1978-2008 period.
   Hence, water resources management planning may require construction of
   water storage facilities to reduce summer flooding and prevent possible
   future water scarcity in the basin.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is a primary component of the water cycle, and its variability
   is associated with drought and flood events. This study investigates the
   trends in annual and seasonal rainfall at 14 rainfall stations in
   Shaanxi Province, China, using an innovative trend analysis (ITA),
   Mann-Kendall test and linear regression analysis. Moreover, using ITA,
   annual rainfall is analysed for different rainfall intensities, and
   seasonal rainfall is analysed for extreme values. The results show
   non-uniform trends in rainfall intensities on a regional and seasonal
   scale. Annual rainfall shows a significant decreasing trend in the Wei
   River Basin and north of the Loess Plateau. Overall, the trend is
   reinforced with the increase of rainfall intensity. A few stations show
   significant trends in seasonal rainfall. Spring rainfall is the major
   contributor to the decline in annual rainfall. Heavy rainfall (more than
   90th percentile) in summer exhibits a marked downward trend mainly in
   the basin, which makes it possible for flooding to abate along the Wei
   River. Light rainfall (less than 10th percentile) shows a prevailing
   increasing trend in summer, but a decreasing trend in other seasons.
   From north to south, the seasonal trends become clearer and stronger. In
   terms of management, more attention should be paid to autumn droughts in
   the Wei River Basin. A quantitative measurement of a trend for ITA is
   proposed. Comparison of the three methods endorses the ITA method.
   Moreover, the ITA shows many advantages, such as graphical results and
   for observing sub-trends. It is hoped that this study can provide
   support for water resources planning, for coping with droughts and
   floods and for future development of the ITA method.},

Abstract = {A significant poleward shift of tropical cyclones (TCs or typhoons) and
   TC-induced storm surge in the western North Pacific has occurred in
   recent decades. Here we use 64 year rainfall observations around Taiwan
   to provide an independent evidence of the shift. We show that, due to
   the island's unique location relative to typhoon tracks, TC-induced
   rainfall trends are significantly rising west and north of the island
   but are insignificant east and southeast, caused by a preference in
   recent decades for TCs to veer more poleward. Analyses of large-scale
   fields indicate that the TCs' poleward shift is caused by the weakening
   of the steering flowand western North Pacific subtropical high, which in
   turn is due to tropic-subtropical Indo-Pacific warming and a weakened
   monsoon, consistent with the expansion of the tropics due to climate
   change.},

Title = {Modelling nonlinear trend for developing non-stationary rainfall

Pages = {1265-1281},

Abstract = {The infrastructure design is primarily based on rainfall
   intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, and the existing IDF curves
   are based on the concept of stationary extreme value theory (EVT) (i.e.
   the occurrence probability of extreme precipitation is not expected to
   change significantly over time). But, the extreme precipitation events
   are increasing due to global climate change and questioning the
   reliability of our current infrastructure design. Based on recent
   developments in the EVT, recent studies proposed a method for developing
   non-stationary rainfall IDF curve by incorporating linear trend in the
   location parameter of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution.
   Upon detecting a significant trend in the extreme rainfall series,
   directly applying the linear trend to develop non-stationary IDF curves
   may increase the bias of the non-stationary model. Hence, it is
   important to develop non-stationary GEV model which has less bias than
   the stationary model by modelling nonlinear trend in the series.
   In this study, we try to develop non-stationary GEV models with less
   bias by modelling nonlinear trend in the series using multi-objective
   genetic algorithm (MOGA). In addition, the proposed GEV model is
   compared with the stationary GEV model and the linear trend-based
   non-stationary GEV model. Furthermore, the Wilmington city and the
   Hyderabad city non-stationary IDF curves are developed and compared with
   stationary IDF curves. From the study results, it is observed that the
   proposed MOGA-based method is able to build the good quality and less
   bias non-stationary GEV models by modelling nonlinear trend in the
   series. In addition, it is also observed that the usage of linear trend
   for modelling non-stationarity in the time series sometimes increase the
   bias of non-stationary model.},

Abstract = {Urban stormwater is a major cause of urban flooding and natural water
   pollution. It is therefore important to assess any hydrologic trends in
   urban catchments for stormwater management and planning. This study
   addresses urban hydrological trend analysis by examining trends in
   variables that characterize hydrological processes. The original and
   modified Mann-Kendall methods are applied to trend detection in two
   French catchments, that is, Chassieu and La Lechere, based on
   approximately 1decade of data from local monitoring programs. In both
   catchments, no trend is found in the major hydrological process driver
   (i.e., rainfall variables), whereas increasing trends are detected in
   runoff flow rates. As a consequence, the runoff coefficients tend to
   increase during the study period, probably due to growing imperviousness
   with the local urbanization process. In addition, conceptual urban
   rainfall-runoff model parameters, which are identified via model
   calibration with an event based approach, are examined. Trend detection
   results indicate that there is no trend in the time of concentration in
   Chassieu, whereas a decreasing trend is present in La Lechere, which,
   however, needs to be validated with additional data. Sensitivity
   analysis indicates that the original Mann-Kendall method is not
   sensitive to a few noisy values in the data series.},

Abstract = {The national economy and food security of many sub-Saharan countries
   relies on rain-fed agriculture, hence the impact of rainfall variability
   is highly significant. The intent of this study is to characterize
   rainfall variability and trend in Awash River Basin for agricultural
   water management using standard rainfall statistical descriptors.
   Long-term climate data of 12 stations were analyzed. Onset and cessation
   dates, length of growing period (LGP) and probability of dry spell
   occurrences were analysed using INSTAT Plus software. The Mann-Kendall
   test and the Sen's slope method were used to assess the statistical
   significance of the trend. The results show high variability of rainfall
   (38-73\%), LGP (30-38 days) and high probability of dry spell occurrence
   (up to 100\%) during the Belg season (the short rainy season from March
   to May) compared with the Kiremt season (the main rainy season from June
   to September) in all stations. Belg season showed a non-significant
   decline trend in most of the stations, whereas the Kiremt season
   indicated the contrary. The finding also revealed that supplementary
   irrigation is vital, especially in the Belg season to cover up to 40\%
   of the crop water requirement deficit.},

Title = {Desertification in western Rajasthan (India): an assessment using remote

Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {86},

Pages = {297-313},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Owing to its impact on global ecosystem, climate change and related
   effects is being perceived as a serious issue worldwide especially in
   the arid and semi-arid regions. Climatic variability has been considered
   as a major cause for degradation of natural resources. Desertification
   caused by climatic or human-induced processes negatively affects the
   productivity of land within an ecosystem. It is noteworthy that
   depletion of vegetation cover plays a key role in land degradation; in
   fact reduction in plants and perennial cover is regarded as an indicator
   of the onset of desertification. Temporal analysis of satellite-based
   NDVI is one of the major remote sensing tools which can identify the
   depletion of vegetation cover. In the present study, rain-use efficiency
   (RUE) method has been used for monitoring vegetation degradation and,
   substantially, the process of desertification in western Rajasthan. RUE,
   the ratio between normalized growing season NDVI and rainfall, has been
   calculated for individual years (1983-2013). A correlation analysis was
   carried out by considering yearly RUE as dependent variable and time
   (years) as the independent variable. It shows that regression slope of
   RUE mainly depends upon the dynamic condition of integrated NDVI and
   rainfall. In order to monitor the areas under human-induced
   desertification, the residual trend method has been adopted. The
   correlation between rainfall and NDVI was found significant (p < 0.05)
   except some portion in the middle east. The study reveals that about
   35\% of the total area has experienced high human-induced
   desertification process.},

Title = {Implementation Trends for Rainwater-Harvesting Technologies and
   Strategies and Their Relationship with Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Various societies across the globe, including that in the United States,
   encounter difficulties fulfilling freshwater consumption needs.
   Implementation of decentralized systems, such as rainwater-harvesting
   technologies and strategies (RwHTS), in capital projects not only
   alleviates developmental patterns of humans on water resources but also
   helps facilities achieve net-zero resource consumption. However,
   implementation of RwHTS can quickly become complex because of multiple
   factors associated with the design of the capital facility. Although
   building information modeling (BIM) possesses inherent capabilities to
   reduce the complexity of systems, the impact it has on the adoption of
   RwHTS needs to be assessed. This research characterized implementation
   patterns for RwHTS and BIM by architectural firms for facilities
   constructed between 2000 and 2010 in six southeastern states and
   Washington, DC, using electronic surveys. In addition, the authors
   analyzed the relationship between the implementation of RwHTS and BIM
   from architectural firms' perspectives. Furthermore, the study also
   identified the relationship between RwHTS/BIM implementation and a
   firm's demographics, previous experience with federal projects, and
   green buildings. Last, the study identified the least and most adopted
   RwHTS types and BIM functions. Future research needs to investigate into
   reasons for adopting RwHTS and the process associated with it. (C) 2016

Title = {Trends in CMIP5 Rainfall Patterns over Southwestern Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1779-1788},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Previous work has shown that the sharp fall in winter rainfall over
   coastal southwestern Australia in the 1970s was mainly due to a fall in
   the frequency of fronts; the gradual reduction in rainfall since the
   late 1990s was due to a reduction in the number of light-rain days; and
   the increased inland summer rainfall in the 1970s was due to an
   increased number of easterly troughs. The current paper extends this
   earlier work by identifying the rainfall patterns in the region in 14
   CMIP5 models for the period 1980-2005 and by calculating how these
   patterns are projected to change in the twenty-first century. The
   patterns are identified using k-means clustering of the rainfall, which
   are validated against observed rainfall clusters. Although the agreement
   between the models and the observation is generally good, the models
   underestimate the frequency of raining fronts. In both representative
   concentration pathway 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios the
   number of dry days increases significantly at the expense of light-rain
   days and frontal rainfall. However, these trends are twice as large in
   the RCP8.5 scenario as in the RCP4.5 scenario. The reduction in the
   rainfall from the historical period to the second half of the
   twenty-first century is produced mainly by a reduction in both the
   frequency and intensity of light rain and a reduction in the frequency
   of fronts in the westerlies.},

Title = {Long Term Spatiotemporal Variability in Rainfall Trends over the State
   of Jharkhand, India},
Journal = {CLIMATE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The current study was conducted to examine the impact of climate change
   on rainfall in Jharkhand state of India. It deals with the analysis of
   the historical spatiotemporal variability of rainfall on the annual,
   seasonal and monthly scale in 18 districts of the state Jharkhand over a
   period of 102 years (1901-2002). Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope
   method were applied to detect trends and the magnitude of change over
   the time period of 102 years (1901-2002). Mann Whitney Pettit's method
   and Cumulative deviations test were applied for detection of shift point
   in the series. The results obtained year 1951 to be the most probable
   shift point in annual rainfall. The trend analysis along with the
   percent change for the data series before (1901-1951) and after the
   shift point (1952-2002) was also done. A significant downward rainfall
   trend was found in annual, monsoon and winter rainfall over the period
   of 102 years. The maximum decrease was found for the Godda (19.77\%) and
   minimum at Purbi Singhbum station (1.95\%). Trend analysis before shift
   point, i.e., during 1901-1951 showed an upward trend in annual rainfall
   and after shift point (1952-2002) a downward trend. The trend analysis
   for entire Jharkhand demonstrated a significant downward trend in annual
   and monsoon rainfall with a decrease of 14.11\% and 15.65\%
   respectively. A downward trend in seasonal rainfall will have a more
   pronounced effect on agricultural activities in the area as it may
   affect the growth phase of the kharif crops (May-October) in the region.},

Abstract = {In this work, we examined spatial and temporal trends for light rain
   days based on daily precipitation measurements, obtained from 1960 to
   2014, from 590 meteorological stations in China. For the analyzed time
   interval, light rain days over eastern China were determined to decrease
   by 0.23 daysyear(-1). In western China, they increased by 0.3
   daysyear(-1). To detect underlying causes for changes in light rain
   days, lower-tropospheric relative humidity was set as a proxy for light
   rain days. We then calculated the respective impacts of
   lower-tropospheric temperature and specific humidity on changes in light
   rain days. A comparison of the contributions of temperature and specific
   humidity resulted in the identification of the main cause of changes.
   Our results indicated that increases in lower-tropospheric temperatures
   reduced light rain days over the entire country, while variations in
   specific humidity dominated regional differences for light rain day
   trends.},

Title = {Which downscaled rainfall data for climate change impact studies in
   urban areas? Review of current approaches and trends},

Abstract = {Changes in extreme precipitation should be one of the primary impacts of
   climate change (CC) in urban areas. To assess these impacts, rainfall
   data from climate models are commonly used. The main goal of this paper
   is to report on the state of knowledge and recent works on the study of
   CC impacts with a focus on urban areas, in order to produce an
   integrated review of various approaches to which future studies can then
   be compared or constructed. Model output statistics (MOS) methods are
   increasingly used in the literature to study the impacts of CC in urban
   settings. A review of previous works highlights the non-stationarity
   nature of future climate data, underscoring the need to revise urban
   drainage system design criteria. A comparison of these studies is made
   difficult, however, by the numerous sources of uncertainty arising from
   a plethora of assumptions, scenarios, and modeling options. All the
   methods used do, however, predict increased extreme precipitation in the
   future, suggesting potential risks of combined sewer overflow
   frequencies, flooding, and back-up in existing sewer systems in urban
   areas. Future studies must quantify more accurately the different
   sources of uncertainty by improving downscaling and correction methods.
   New research is necessary to improve the data validation process, an
   aspect that is seldom reported in the literature. Finally, the potential
   application of non-stationarity conditions into generalized extreme
   value (GEV) distribution should be assessed more closely, which will
   require close collaboration between engineers, hydrologists,
   statisticians, and climatologists, thus contributing to the ongoing
   reflection on this issue of social concern.},

Abstract = {The eastern flanks of the Central Andes are characterized by deep
   convection, exposing them to hydrometeorological extreme events, often
   resulting in floods and a variety of mass movements. We assessed the
   spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall trends and the changes in the
   magnitude and frequency of extreme events (ae<yen>95th percentile) along
   an E-W traverse across the southern Central Andes using rain-gauge and
   high-resolution gridded datasets (CPC-uni and TRMM 3B42 V7). We
   generated different climate indices and made three key observations: (1)
   an increase of the annual rainfall has occurred at the transition
   between low (< 0.5 km) and intermediate (0.5-3 km) elevations between
   1950 and 2014. Also, rainfall increases during the wet season and, to a
   lesser degree, decreases during the dry season. Increasing trends in
   annual total amounts characterize the period 1979-2014 in the arid,
   high-elevation southern Andean Plateau, whereas trend reversals with
   decreasing annual total amounts were found at low elevations. (2) For
   all analyzed periods, we observed small or no changes in the median
   values of the rainfall-frequency distribution, but significant trends
   with intensification or attenuation in the 95th percentile. (3) In the
   southern Andean Plateau, extreme rainfall events exhibit trends towards
   increasing magnitude and, to a lesser degree, frequency during the wet
   season, at least since 1979. Our analysis revealed that low (< 0.5 km),
   intermediate (0.5-3 km), and high-elevation (> 3 km) areas respond
   differently to changing climate conditions, and the transition zone
   between low and intermediate elevations is characterized by the most
   significant changes.},

Title = {Spatial variability of rainfall trends in Iran},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to analyze the spatial variability
   of rainfall trends using the spatial variability methods of rainfall
   trend patterns in Iran. The study represents a method on the
   effectiveness of spatial variability for predicting rainfall trend
   patterns variations. In rainfall trend analysis and spatial variability
   methods, seven techniques were used: Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope
   method, geostatistical tools as a global polynomial interpolation and
   the spatial autocorrelation ( Global Moran's I), high/ low clustering (
   Getis-Ord General G), precipitation concentration index, generate
   spatial weights matrix tool, and activation functions of semiliner,
   sigmoid, bipolar sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent in the artificial
   neural network technique. For the spatial variability of monthly
   rainfall trends, trend tests were used in 140 stations of spatial
   variability of rainfall trends in the 1975-2014 period. We analyzed the
   long and short scale spatial variability of rainfall series in Iran.
   Spatial variability distribution of rainfall series was depicted using
   geostatistical methods ( ordinary kriging). Relative nugget effect (
   RNE) predicted from variograms which showed weak, moderate, and strong
   spatial variability for seasonal and annual rainfall series. Moreover,
   the rainfall trends at each station were examined using the trend tests
   at a significance level of 0.05. The results show that temporal and
   spatial trend patterns are different in Iran and the monthly rainfall
   had a downward ( decreasing) trend in most stations, and the trend was
   statistically significant for most of the series ( 73.5\% of the
   stations demonstrated a decreasing trend with 0.5 significance level).
   Rainfall downward trends are generally temporal-spatial patterns in
   Iran. The monthly variations of rainfall decreased significantly
   throughout eastern and central Iran, but they increased in the west and
   north of Iran during the studied interval. The variability patterns of
   monthly rainfall were statistically significant and spatially random.
   Activation functions in the artificial neural network models, in annual
   time scale, had spatially dispersed distribution with other clustering
   patterns. The results of this study confirm that variability of rainfall
   revealing diverse patterns over Iran should be controlled mainly by
   trend patterns in the west and north parts and by random and dispersed
   patterns in the central, southern, and eastern parts.},

Abstract = {Future rainfall dynamics in the Kilimanjaro region will mainly be
   influenced by both global climate and local land-cover change. An
   increase in rainfall is expected, but rising temperatures are also
   predicted for the ecosystem. In situ rainfall of five stations is
   analyzed to determine seasonal variability and multidecadal trends in
   the lowlands and lower elevations of the Kilimanjaro region. Monthly
   rainfall totals are obtained from the Tanzanian Meteorological Agency,
   from two mission stations, and from a sugar cane plantation. The
   datasets of the two mission stations cover time spans of 64 and 62
   years, starting in 1940 and 1942, while rainfall data obtained from the
   Tanzanian Meteorological Agency and from the sugar cane plantation start
   in 1973 and 1974 and thus cover 40-41 years. In one out of five
   stations, a significant weak negative linear long-term trend in rainfall
   is observable, which is also evident in the other locations but is not
   significant. However, humid and dry decades are evident and seasonality
   has changed, especially during the long rains between March and May. El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in combination with positive Indian
   Ocean dipole (IOD) leads to enhanced rainfall during the year of ENSO
   onset and the following year. During La Nina years, rainfall increases
   in the following year, while during the onset year rainfall patterns are
   more diverse. Positive IOD leads to enhanced rainfall amounts.},

   to standardized precipitation index (SPI) analysis, homogeneity tests,
   trend analysis and exponential smoothing in order to make a short time
   rainfall prediction. The results showed that the annual rainfall amount
   was highly dependent on latitude and elevation. Through the SPI
   analysis, a severe dry period closely related to the North Atlantic
   Oscillation (NAO) was observed during the last three decades in the
   Cheliff watershed, the most significant negative trend in the annual
   rainfall was registered above a latitude of 35 degrees; indeed, above
   this latitude, there was a highly significant decrease in the
   probability of exceedance of a specific precipitation amount during the
   last 30 years. The major rainfall shift occurred around 1980, and
   according to simple exponential smoothing, the area will witness
   relative rainfall stability below a latitude of 35 degrees and a small
   increase above this latitude over the next 10 years.},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of hydro-climatic variables provide useful information
   for effective planning, designing and management of water resources and
   agricultural production. Trends in observed stream flow at upstream and
   midstream gauging stations (GS), Wellawaya, Thanamalwila \& rainfall and
   temperature in the Kirindi Oya river basin were assessed using the
   Mann-Kendall, Modified Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope. Average rainfalls
   for the two catchments and for the entire basin were computed using
   `Thessen polygon' method. The relationships between trends in stream
   flow and catchment rainfall were studied by Spearman's Rho correlation
   coefficient (rho).
   Five year Moving averaged Standardize Anomalies (FMSA) of both annual
   stream flow and rainfall at Wellawaya and Thanamalwila catchments were
   in a non-significant (p < 0.05) decreasing trend for 1994 to 2010.Though
   there was a positive correlation between annual catchment rainfall and
   stream flow of these two catchments, correlation was significant (p <
   0.05) only at Thanamalwila (0.69) suggesting that the variation of
   annual stream flow at Thanamalwila GS was mainly attributed to the
   variation of catchment rainfall. However, variation of stream flow
   during North East Monsoon (NEM) season was mainly attributed to the
   variation of respective catchment rainfall of both the catchments as
   evident by significant higher `rho' at Wellawaya (0.61) and Thanamalwila
   (0.69). This study also found that trend of FMSA of South West Monsoon
   (SWM) rain was significantly (p < 0.05) decreasing for the entire basin,
   Thanamalwila and Wellawaya sub-catchments. Stream flow at Wellawaya GS
   during SWM was also found to be significantly decreasing while
   Thanamalwila stream flow was non-significantly decreasing. Both rainfall
   and stream flow during First Inter Monsoon (FM) was in a significant
   increasing trend particularly in the month of April. These observed
   trends during SWM and FIM suggest an apparent early onset of SWM in the
   basin, or drastic deviation in receiving rain during SWM in the Kirindi
   Oya river basin.},

Abstract = {Rainfall and potential evapotranspiration are important variables in
   water balance study. Rainfall data were obtained from Malaysian
   Meteorological Department while estimates of potential
   evapotranspiration were calculated using Penman-Monteith method. Trend
   analysis of monthly and annual rainfall, potential evapotranspiration
   and rainfall deficit are essential to manage irrigation system in
   agricultural systems. This is because changes in trend of these
   parameters may affect the water cycle and ecosystem. Annual and monthly
   values of these variables were analysed from 1980-2009. Results
   indicated increasing trends of 16.2mm yr(-1) and 3.01 mm yr(-1) for both
   annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, respectively.
   Consequently, these trends resulted in annual rainfall deficit of 1.69mm
   per year.},

Abstract = {The trends in annual maximum rainfall (AMR) intensity data in New South
   Wales, Australia, were examined. Data from 60 stations were used
   covering three study periods, 1955-2010, 1965-2010 and 1978-2010.
   Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman's rho (SR) tests were applied to assess
   trends at local stations. Pre-whitening (PW), trend-free pre-whitening
   (TFPW) and the variance correction (VC) tests were used to assess the
   effects of serial correlation on trend results. For regional trend
   analysis, the regional MK test was employed. The impacts of climatic
   variability modes on the observed trends in AMR intensity and seasonal
   maximum rainfall data were investigated. It was found that positive
   trends were more frequent than the negative ones. The PW, TFPW and VC
   tests resulted in a slight reduction in the count of stations exhibiting
   significant positive trends. The number of stations exhibiting
   significant trends decreased when the impact of climate variability
   modes was considered.},

Title = {Trends in Rainbow Trout Recruitment, Abundance, Survival, and Growth
   during a Boom-and-Bust Cycle in a Tailwater Fishery},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {146},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1043-1057},
Abstract = {Data from a large-scale mark-recapture study were used in an
   open-population model to determine the cause for long-term trends in
   growth and abundance of a Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss population
   in the tailwater of Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona. Reduced growth affected
   multiple life stages and processes, causing negative feedbacks that
   regulated the abundance of the population, including higher mortality of
   larger fish; lower rates of recruitment (young of the year) during years
   when growth was reduced; and lower rates of sexual maturation in the
   following year. High and steady flows during spring and summer 2011
   resulted in a very large recruitment event. The population had declined
   tenfold by 2016 due to a combination of lower recruitment and reduced
   survival of larger trout. Survival rates for 225-mm and larger Rainbow
   Trout in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 11, 21, and 22\% lower, respectively,
   than average survival rates between 2012 and 2013. Abundance at the end
   of the study would have been threefold to fivefold higher if survival
   rates for larger individuals had remained at the elevated levels
   estimated for 2012 and 2013. Growth declined between 2012 and 2014 owing
   to reduced prey availability, which led to very poor fish condition
   (similar to 0.90-0.95) by fall 2014. Poor condition in turn resulted in
   low survival rates of larger fish during fall 2014 and winter 2015,
   which contributed to the population collapse. In Glen Canyon, large
   recruitment events driven by high flows can lead to population increases
   that cannot be sustained due to limitations in prey supply. When the
   ability to regulate prey supply is lacking, flows that reduce the
   probability of large recruitment events can be used to avoid
   boom-and-bust population cycles. Our study demonstrates that
   mark-recapture is a very informative approach for understanding the
   dynamics of tailwater trout populations.},

Abstract = {Huge number of irrigation projects are planned and executed throughout
   the globe for boosting agricultural production. However, in many of the
   irrigation projects the problem of efficient water management is
   becoming more complex with every passing year. The main reason for this
   may be the changing trends of water availability and demand, which is
   mainly dependent on precipitation. Though the irrigation projects are
   designed considering long-term historical climatic conditions, however,
   the accelerated climatic shift and change has put forward situations
   which were unimaginable in the past. Keeping this as background, in the
   present study, rainfall trend analysis has been done over the command
   area of Eastern Ganga Canal (EGC) command for both pre project
   implementation phase (1901-1970) and post project implementation phase
   (1971-2012). Daily rainfall data of 102 years has been analysed using
   the non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods to highlight the
   trends in annual, seasonal rainfall and number of rainy days. Analysis
   result showed increasing trend of 0.93 mm/year and 2.03 mm/year in
   annual rainfall and monsoon rainfall respectively, in the pre-project
   implementation phase, while decreasing trend of 0.27 mm/year and 1.11
   mm/year in annual rainfall and monsoonal rainfall, respectively, in
   post-implementation phase has been observed. Further, occupancy of dry
   years was analysed using five year moving average analysis. The results
   indicated increase in probability of occurrence of dry years in pre to
   post project implementation phase from 7.1\% to 14.3\%. These results
   will help project managers in development of alternative management
   strategy.},

Abstract = {This study developed a standard methodology for identifying spatial
   trends using satellite-based raster datasets. It involves the novelty of
   exploring the capabilities of a geographic information system in
   implementing the procedures of three trend tests, the Spearman rank
   order correlation (SROC) test, the Kendall rank correlation (KRC) test
   and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, on raster datasets of the Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees resolution.
   Comparative evaluation of the three tests revealed fair agreement of a
   major part of the test results for pre-, post- and non-monsoon and
   one-day maximum rainfall. Also, similar results from KRC and MK tests
   were obtained over a considerable area for annual, monsoon and monthly
   maximum rainfall. These findings suggest the importance of selecting the
   appropriate test depending on rainfall magnitudes at the chosen time
   scale and emphasize the robustness of the KRC and MK tests.},

Abstract = {This study examined trends and change points in 100-year annual and
   seasonal rainfall over hot and cold arid regions of India. Using k-means
   clustering, 32 stations were classified into two clusters: the
   coefficient of variation for annual and seasonal rainfall was relatively
   high for Cluster-II compared to Cluster-I. Short-term and long-term
   persistence was more dominant in Cluster-II (entirely arid) and
   Cluster-I (partly arid), respectively. Trend tests revealed prominent
   increasing trends in annual and wet season rainfall of Cluster-II. Dry
   season rainfall increased by 1.09 mm year(-1) in the cold arid region.
   The significant change points in annual and wet season rainfall mostly
   occurred in the period 1941-1955 (hot and cold), and in the dry season
   in the period 1973-1975 (hot arid) and in 1949 (cold arid). The findings
   are useful for managing a surplus or deficiency of rainwater in the

Abstract = {The green roofs appear as technology for the improvement water quality.
   This article identifies trends in the conditions of design, construction
   and operation of green roofs, which aim is to improve the quality of
   rainwater. A literature review was carried out in order to collect 45
   original research papers from databases as Scopus, Science Direct, and
   Redalyc. From the information collected trends in increments and
   reductions in the concentrations of the main water quality parameters,
   seasons of the year with the best results, types of green roofs, types
   of substrate and most common components, construction trends
   (dimensions, inclination, Materials and layers) and vegetation used in
   these systems have been determined. The results show that green roofs
   have the ability to neutralize acid rain. Extensive type roofs are the
   ones most commonly used, due to its characteristics of construction,
   functionality and low maintenance requirements.},

Abstract = {In this study, a possible trend that may be occurring is being
   investigated, and the trend being investigated is the total annual
   rainfalls fall in Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. For this reason,
   Mann-Kendall test, Spearman's Rho test and Sen's slope method was
   applied to total annual rainfall data collected from 38 rainfall
   observation stations.
   According to the study results; there has been a significant decrease in
   rainfall in 4 observation stations: Baskil, Dogansehir, Ercis and
   Sivrice, with 95\% confidence level. There is a 10\% significance level,
   that Agin and Elazig have also seen decreasing trends in rainfall.
   According to Sen's slope method there has been a a decrease observed in
   28 stations, also there has been no significant increase in rainfall
   being observed in 10 other observation stations. There is a general
   increasing trend in rainfall that dominates Eastern Anatolia Region's
   northern parts, while a decreasing trend is occurring in the southern
   and western region. These results could be due to regional climate
   changes and are consistent with projections related to climate change

Title = {Meteorological hazard assessment based on trends and abrupt changes in
   rainfall characteristics on the Korean peninsula},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {127},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {This study presents a statistical approach for assessing meteorological
   hazards based on trends and abrupt changes in precipitation
   characteristics. Daily rainfall data from 64 stations in South Korea
   (SK) and 27 stations in North Korea (NK) were used to identify temporal
   patterns in the rainfall characteristics of both regions using seven
   rainfall indices, such as the total annual rainfall and annual number of
   wet days. This study suggests the use of three steps in identifying
   meteorological hazards based on two statistical analyses. In step 1, we
   conducted a trend analysis of a 10-year moving average of the rainfall
   index using the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test. Most stations (65.6 \%) in
   SK exhibit clear increasing trends in five indices, whereas far fewer
   have data indicating any trends in five of the indices in NK (25.9 \%).
   In step 2, abrupt changes in all rainfall indices were identified using
   a Bayesian Change Point (BCP) approach. The results contradict those
   from the MK trend analysis. The proportion of stations in NK where
   trends were identified is much higher than that in SK. In step 3, the
   results from the two previous steps were integrated to identify the
   meteorological hazards based on the identified trend and change point.
   The BCP approach can be used to identify meteorological hazards that MK
   cannot, as the former approach focuses on the change point during the
   entire period. As a result, meteorological stability at the sites of
   weather stations can be identified, and then the meteorological hazards
   across the entire Korean peninsula can be spatially interpolated.
   Although SK and NK are located on the same peninsula, distinct
   differences in the trends were observed.},

Abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a
   comprehensive review of the potential impacts on the hydrological
   variables of the man induced climate changes. It states that such
   changes will likely increase runoff in the higher latitude regions
   because of increased precipitation; also, the flood frequency is
   expected to change in some locations and the severity of drought events
   could also increase as a result of the changes both in precipitation and
   evaporation. Observations show that changes are occurring in the amount,
   intensity, frequency and type of precipitation. The frequency of extreme
   temperatures during the summer is likely to be higher. The Mann-Kendall
   test coupled with the Sen's slope was applied to identify the
   significant trends, positive or negative trend and the magnitude of
   those trends. The results achieved for rainfall revealed more frequent
   significant decreasing trends in Syria in the last 19 years.},

Title = {Analyses of rainfall trends in the Nile River Basin},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {36-51},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Trends in rainfall at 39 locations of the Nile River Basin (NRB) in
   Africa were analyzed. Comparison was made between rainfall trend results
   from the long-term data and those of short-term series selected over
   different time periods. The bias on trend results from series of
   short-term records was quantified. Homogeneity test was conducted to
   assess the coherence of the trend directions on a regional basis. Based
   on an assumed population (for simplicity) of rainfall data time periods
   in the range 75-100 years, bias in the short-term trend analysis was
   noted to reduce by about 10\% for every 10\% increase in record length.
   Under some conditions if respected, it was possible to derive trends at
   stations with short rainfall records based on those at nearby stations
   with longer term records but in the same region. Using the same data
   record length and uniform time period at all the selected stations, an
   improved regional coherence of rainfall trend results was obtained. In
   the equatorial region, trend in annual rainfall was found mainly
   positive and significant at level alpha = 5\% in 4 of the 7 stations.
   Collectively for Sudan, Ethiopia and Egypt, trends in the annual
   rainfall were mostly negative and significant at alpha = 5\% in 69\% of
   the 32 stations. Heterogeneity in the trend directions for the entire
   NRB was confirmed at alpha = 1\% in 13\% of the 39 stations. These
   findings are vital for water and agricultural management practices. (C)

Abstract = {Rainfall erosivity is an important factor for estimating soil erosion
   rates. Understanding the spatial distribution and temporal trends of
   rainfall erosivity is especially critical for soil erosion risk
   assessment and soil conservation planning in mainland China. However,
   reports on the spatial distribution and temporal trends of rainfall
   erosivity for China, especially of its eight soil erosion regions, are
   still lacking, which reduces the accuracy of predicting soil losses,
   assessing soil erosion risks and evaluating the effects of soil
   conservation measures. Additionally, the lack of the most suitable
   spatial interpolation method in mainland China, to some degree, has
   reduced the applicability and reliability of the interpolation results.
   In this study, long-term (1951-2010) daily rainfall data from 756
   national weather stations were assembled to characterize the spatial and
   temporal patterns of annual rainfall erosivity across mainland China.
   Sixteen spatial interpolation methods were compared to select the most
   suitable one for accurately mapping the spatial distribution of rainfall
   erosivity, and the Mann-Kendall test was employed to detect the temporal
   trends. The results indicated that 1) the universal co-kriging method
   with the aid of elevation was superior to the other spatial
   interpolation methods; 2) long-term average rainfall erosivity increased
   from the northwest to the southeast, ranging from 31 to 30,051 MJ mm
   ha(-1) h(-1) a(-1); 3) overall, rainfall erosivity across China and
   water erosion regions experienced an insignificant increasing trend over
   the study period. Significant decreasing trends were observed in the
   northwest Loess Plateau region (0.01 level), the northeast black soil
   region and the north earth and gravel mountain region (0.05 level).
   Significant increasing trends (0.05 level) were found in the southern
   red soil hilly region and the southwest Karst region; and 4) two lines
   were identified according to the temporal trends of rainfall erosivity
   from the east to the west. In total, this study offers useful
   information both for soil erosion prediction and land management
   practices of mainland China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {The changes in extreme rainfall associated with a warming climate have
   drawn significant attention in recent years. Mounting evidence shows
   that sub-daily convective rainfall extremes are increasing faster than
   the rate of change in the atmospheric precipitable water capacity with a
   warming climate. However, the response of extreme precipitation depends
   on the type of storm supported by the meteorological environment. Here
   using long-term satellite, surface radar and rain-gauge network data and
   atmospheric reanalyses, we show that the observed increases in
   springtime total and extreme rainfall in the central United States are
   dominated by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), the largest type of
   convective storm, with increased frequency and intensity of long-lasting
   MCSs. A strengthening of the southerly low-level jet and its associated
   moisture transport in the Central/Northern Great Plains, in the overall
   climatology and particularly on days with long-lasting MCSs, accounts
   for the changes in the precipitation produced by these storms.},

Title = {Exploring climate change perceptions, rainfall trends and perceived
   barriers to adaptation in a drought affected region in India},
Journal = {NATURAL HAZARDS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {84},
Number = {2},
Pages = {777-796},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change poses major challenges to agricultural systems in drought
   prone regions of the world especially in the areas with high poverty,
   lack of irrigation facilities and low productivity. Towards this it is
   essential to understand the climate change perceptions, adaptation
   practices and barriers to effective adaptation at household and
   community level. This paper using household surveys and focus group
   discussions in one of the drought prone areas of Odisha in India,
   explores various aspects of perception on climate change and barriers to
   adaptation. It also analyses the accuracy of perceptions based on
   rainfall data from nearest meteorological stations. The study reinforces
   the argument by earlier studies that the perception by people simply
   cannot be wrong because they may have a just a low correlation with
   underlying meteorological data. Results suggest that farmers
   increasingly perceive the changes in the rainfall and temperature
   patterns. However, when compared with the trend in actual rainfall data,
   perceptions on rainfall are found to more closely align with the results
   from the nearest station as compared to the station farther from it.
   Analysis revealed that seasonal rainfall variability has a profound
   influence on the farmers' perceptions on climate change and drought in
   the study region. Farmers' are still dependent on the traditional
   forecasting system because of the lack of access to modern climate
   forecasting and tailored information for agricultural practice. Although
   farmers in the study region are already adapting to the changing
   climate, the study finds that while lack of access to water and
   irrigation, information on climate change adaptation and early warning
   systems are major barriers to adaptation at the household level lack of
   government intervention, lack of knowledge on drought resistant crops
   and varieties and lack of renovation of water bodies and irrigation were
   mentioned as the major barriers at the community level. Findings from
   the paper argue for better adaptation planning at the local level
   incorporating local level perceptions and barriers to adaptation. In
   such areas local level planning can be crucial in enhancing the adaptive
   capacity of the farmers.},

Abstract = {Precipitation is one of the main components in water budget balance and
   its trend analysis could help to understand the hydrological features of
   a basin in the future. In this study, 10 subbasins in western Iran are
   selected. One rain gauge station is chosen as a control station and
   three more are selected upstream, in the middle, and downstream of each
   subbasin. Average monthly and annual rainfall time series are analyzed
   and then the trends are investigated. Analysis of mentioned time series
   of control stations reveals that 51\% of time series have decreasing
   trends, while 49\% experience increasing trends. Six out of 10 studied
   subbasins have decreasing trend of average annual rainfall time series
   all over the basin. Among the most rainy months in the country (November
   to May), in November 68\% of the stations have upward trend, while in
   March 92\% of the stations have downward trend. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {Australia experienced record high rainfall in austral spring 2010, which
   has previously been attributed to the concurrence of a strong La Nia
   event and a strong positive excursion of the Southern Annular Mode
   (SAM). In this study, we examine the role of the sea surface temperature
   (SST) trend over the recent 50 years, which has large warming over the
   tropical Indian, western Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, in driving
   the extraordinary climate conditions of spring 2010, using the
   Australian Bureau of Meteorology coupled model seasonal forecast system.
   Four forecast sensitivity experiments were designed by using randomly
   chosen atmospheric initial conditions but with: (1) observed ocean
   initial conditions for 1 September 2010; (2) the same ocean initial
   conditions except the linear temperature trend over the period 1960-2010
   was removed; (3) ocean initial conditions in which the trend was added
   to the climatological ocean state for 1 September; and (4)
   climatological ocean conditions only. A synergistic response to the La
   Nia SST anomalies and the SST trend was detected: the tropical rainfall
   anomalies were amplified over the western side of the Indo-Pacific
   warm-pool, which led to a significant increase of tropical upper
   tropospheric warming and a resultant increase of meridional temperature
   gradient in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropics. Consequently, the
   SH eddy-driven jet was shifted poleward (i.e. positive phase of the
   SAM), which induced rainfall over subtropical Australia. Our findings
   highlight that the interaction of interannual anomalies and the trend
   may play an important role in the amplification of extreme events.},

Abstract = {Precipitation patterns worldwide are changing under the effects of
   global warming. The impacts of these changes could dramatically affect
   the hydrological cycle and, consequently, the availability of water
   resources. In order to improve the quality and reliability of
   forecasting models, it is important to analyse historical precipitation
   data to account for possible future changes. For these reasons, a large
   number of studies have recently been carried out with the aim of
   investigating the existence of statistically significant trends in
   precipitation at different spatial and temporal scales. In this paper,
   the existence of statistically significant trends in rainfall from
   observational datasets, which were measured by 245 rain gauges over
   Sicily (Italy) during the 1921-2012 period, was investigated. Annual,
   seasonal and monthly time series were examined using the Mann-Kendall
   non-parametric statistical test to detect statistically significant
   trends at local and regional scales, and their significance levels were
   assessed. Prior to the application of the Mann-Kendall test, the
   historical dataset was completed using a geostatistical spatial
   interpolation technique, the residual ordinary kriging, and then
   processed to remove the influence of serial correlation on the test
   results, applying the procedure of trend-free pre-whitening. Once the
   trends at each site were identified, the spatial patterns of the
   detected trends were examined using spatial interpolation techniques.
   Furthermore, focusing on the 30 years from 1981 to 2012, the trend
   analysis was repeated with the aim of detecting short-term trends or
   possible changes in the direction of the trends. Finally, the effect of
   climate change on the seasonal distribution of rainfall during the year
   was investigated by analysing the trend in the precipitation
   concentration index. The application of the Mann-Kendall test to the
   rainfall data provided evidence of a general decrease in precipitation
   in Sicily during the 1921-2012 period. Downward trends frequently
   occurred during the autumn and winter months. However, an increase in
   total annual precipitation was detected during the period from 1981 to
   2012.},

Abstract = {This study has been attempted to investigate the seasonal and annual
   trends and variations in the occurrence{''} of extreme rainfall over
   different Indian region and India as a whole. Trends and variations are
   examined on the basis of following parameters (i) frequency and
   magnitude of extreme rainfall intensity (ERI) and its contribution in
   total rainfall (ii) highest rainfall events (iii) frequency of extreme
   rainfall events and days (iv) frequency of rainfall events and days with
   daily rainfall above 100 mm and 200 mm in a grid box (1 degrees x 1
   degrees) over different Indian regions and India as a whole. Daily
   gridded rainfall data from India Meteorological Department (AVID)
   available at 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution has been used to examine
   trends and variations associated with extreme rainfall events. Based on
   the long term 95 and 99 percentile values of daily total/maximum
   rainfall as a threshold for extreme rainfall intensity/events of
   category 1 and category 2 respectively, the trends and variations in
   above mentioned parameters are analyzed for the periods 1951-2007,
   1951-1980 and 1981-2007.
   The magnitude of highest intensity rainfall is increased over country as
   a whole and over peninsular India; it is found to be increased by 1\%
   during 1981-2007 as compared to period 1951-1980. The frequency of
   extreme rainfall intensity (ERI) days of category 1 is found to be
   significant increasing (0.4 days/decade) over north central region and
   significant decreasing trend is found over north east region (0.5
   days/decade) during the pre-monsoon season. The magnitude of 24 hours
   highest rainfall in a grid box is found to be significant increasing
   over all regions under consideration except over north east and south
   peninsular regions. Over the last ten years period of the present study,
   most of the 24 hours highest rainfall events in a grid box are seen over
   west peninsular region. Generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution
   fitted with annual highest rainfall event over the country as a whole
   and over different Indian region indicates an increase in magnitude of
   most probable 24 hours highest rainfall in a grid box during second half
   of the study period over north central region of the country. Analysis
   also reveals an increase in frequency and severity of extreme rainfall
   over north west, north central and west peninsular regions during the
   period of 1981-2007 as compared to 1950-1980.
   Annual frequency of days and events with extreme rainfall of both
   categories is increased most significantly over country during the
   period of present study (1951-2007). Significant increasing trends in
   frequency of days with extreme rainfall of both categories is noticed
   only during the monsoon season while extreme rainfall events showed
   increasing trends during monsoon and winter season over country as a
   whole. Number of days and events with daily rainfall in any grid box
   above 100 mm and 200 mm is observed to be significantly increased over
   the country. Out of six regions, significant increasing trends in annual
   number of days with rainfall above 100 mm in a grid box is observed over
   north central and north east regions and for rainfall above 200 mm
   significant increase is observed over north west and north central
   regions.},

Abstract = {Between 1950 and 2012, boreal summer (rainy season) rainfall in the
   Sahel changed from a multi-decadal decreasing trend to an increasing
   trend (positive trend shift) in the mid-1980s. We found that this trend
   shift was synchronous with similar trend shifts in global oceanic
   evaporation and in land precipitation on all continents except the
   Americas. The trend shift in oceanic evaporation occurred mainly in the
   Southern Hemisphere (SH) and the subtropical oceans of the Northern
   Hemisphere (NH). Because increased oceanic evaporation strengthens the
   atmospheric moisture transport toward land areas, the synchrony of
   oceanic evaporation and land precipitation is reasonable. Surface scalar
   winds over the SH oceans also displayed a positive trend shift. Sea
   surface temperature (SST) displayed a trend shift in the mid-1980s that
   was negative (increasing, then decreasing) in the SH and positive in the
   NH. Although SST had opposite trend shifts in both hemispheres, the
   trend shift in evaporation was positive in both hemispheres. We infer
   that because strong winds promote evaporative cooling, the trend shift
   in SH winds strengthened the trend shifts in both SST and evaporation in
   the SH. Because high SST promotes evaporation, the trend shift in NH SST
   strengthened the NH trend shift in evaporation. Thus differing oceanic
   roles in the SH and NH generated the positive trend shift in
   evaporation; however, the details of moisture transport toward the Sahel
   are still unclear, or perhaps there is no single determining influence.},

Abstract = {Extreme rainfall events are meteorological hazards that cause great
   damage and many casualties in the world. This paper examines the trends
   in extreme rainfall from 10 sub-daily time series and 44 daily time
   series in Cote d'Ivoire. Rainfall data were converted into indices. In
   total, six (6) indices were used for daily extreme rainfall and one (1)
   index for sub-daily extreme rainfall (15 to 240 min). Two statistical
   tests for trend detection were used to evaluate the possible trend in
   these precipitation data. The first is a Mann-Kendall non-parametric
   trend test, used to evaluate the existence of monotonic trends. The
   second is a linear regression method, based on a parametric approach to
   trend detection. Results show that very few statistically significant
   decreasing trends can be detected at the sub-daily and daily timescales.
   Some decreasing trends in extreme rainfall events were localized in the
   south and southeast. These results could enhance the implementation of
   adaptation systems to flood risk.},

   1942-2002 of the Sindh river basin, India, were analysed for monthly,
   seasonal and annual trends. The conventional Mann-Kendall test (MK) and
   Mann-Kendall test (MMK), after the removal of the effect of all
   significant autocorrelation coefficients, and Sen's slope estimator were
   used to identify the trends. Kriging technique was used for
   interpolating the spatial pattern using Arc GIS 9.3. The analysis
   suggested significant increase in the trend of rainfall for seasonal and

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability of rainfall patterns in the
   northwestern belt of India has been monitored over a period of 60 years
   (1949-2009). The trends and shifts in the data have been calculated
   using the Modified Mann-Kendall test (MMK) and the Pettitt-Mann-Whitney
   test (PMW), respectively. To explain the shifts in rainfall at different
   stations in the northwestern region, the dominant climate indices were
   analysed for pre- and post-shift years. The climate indices and rainfall
   distribution data were subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   in order to understand the nature of rainfall distribution and the
   dominant indices related to its variability. The analysis of PCA results
   with respect to season shows that each station is influenced by one or
   more climatic factors; however, these factors are themselves influenced
   by other important atmospheric phenomena, such as western disturbances.
   The preliminary principle component analysis of rainfall data with
   respect to climatic indices indicates that Nino 3.4 and Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO) are the dominant climatic indices that have caused a
   shift in the rainfall pattern of western India, along with land use/land
   cover changes.},

Abstract = {This study was based on daily rainfall data of 48 stations distributed
   over the entire island covering a 30-year period from 1981 to 2010. Data
   analysis was done to identify the spatial pattern of rainfall trends.
   The methods employed in data analysis are linear regression and
   interpolation by Universal Kriging and Radial Basis function. The slope
   of linear regression curves of 48 stations was used in interpolation.
   The regression coefficients show spatially and seasonally variable
   positive and negative trends of annual and seasonal rainfall. About half
   of the mean annual pentad series show negative trends, while the rest
   shows positive trends. By contrast, the rainfall trends of the Southwest
   Monsoon (SWM) season are predominantly negative throughout the country.
   The first phase of the Northeast Monsoon (NEM1) displays downward trends
   everywhere, with the exception of the Southeastern coastal area. The
   strongest negative trends were found in the Northeast and in the Central
   Highlands. The second phase (NEM2) is mostly positive, except in the
   Northeast. The Inter-Monsoon (IM) periods have predominantly upward
   trends almost everywhere, but still the trends in some parts of the
   Highlands and Northeast are negative. The long-term data at Watawala
   Nuwara Eliya and Sandringham show a consistent decline in the rainfall
   over the last 100 years, particularly during the SWM. There seems to be
   a faster decline in the rainfall in the last 3 decades. These trends are
   consistent with the observations in India. It is generally accepted that
   there has been changes in the circulation pattern. Weakening of the SWM
   circulation parameters caused by global warming appears to be the main
   causes of recent changes. Effect of the Asian Brown Cloud may also play
   a role in these changes.},

Abstract = {India's agricultural output, economy, and societal well-being are
   strappingly dependent on the stability of summer monsoon rainfall, its
   variability and extremes. Spatial aggregate of intensity and frequency
   of extreme rainfall events over Central India are significantly
   increasing, while at local scale they are spatially non-uniform with
   increasing spatial variability. The reasons behind such increase in
   spatial variability of extremes are poorly understood and the trends in
   mean monsoon rainfall have been greatly overlooked. Here, by using
   multi-decadal gridded daily rainfall data over entire India, we show
   that the trend in spatial variability of mean monsoon rainfall is
   decreasing as exactly opposite to that of extremes. The spatial
   variability of extremes is attributed to the spatial variability of the
   convective rainfall component. Contrarily, the decrease in spatial
   variability of the mean rainfall over India poses a pertinent research
   question on the applicability of large scale inter-basin water transfer
   by river inter-linking to address the spatial variability of available
   water in India. We found a significant decrease in the monsoon rainfall
   over major water surplus river basins in India. Hydrological simulations
   using a Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model also revealed that
   the water yield in surplus river basins is decreasing but it is
   increasing in deficit basins. These findings contradict the traditional
   notion of dry areas becoming drier and wet areas becoming wetter in
   response to climate change in India. This result also calls for a
   re-evaluation of planning for river inter-linking to supply water from
   surplus to deficit river basins.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate 50 years (1964-2013) of
   seasonal and annual rainfall trends and their fluctuation over time in
   northern Bangladesh. After testing the autocorrelation, non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test along with Sen Slope estimator was used to examine
   rainfall trends and their magnitudes. The sequential Mann-Kendall test
   was used to identify any fluctuations in the trends over time and to
   detect the possible points of change in the rainfall series. We found
   that pre-monsoon and post-monsoon rainfall is increasing in most of the
   rainfall stations. The only decrement in pre-monsoon rainfall was found
   for Ishurdi (128 mm/year). However, the sequential Mann-Kendall test
   detected decreasing pre-monsoon rainfall trend after early the 1990s.
   Monsoon rainfall showed a decreasing trend in the majority of the area
   studied. The maximum decrement in monsoon rainfall was found for Sylhet
   station (8.10 mm/year) and minimum in Mymensingh (1.53 mm/year). An
   upward monsoon rainfall trend was found for Rangpur (2.02 mm/year).
   Annual rainfall followed the monsoon rainfall trend. However, all of the
   positive and negative trends were found statistically non-significant at
   95\% confidence limit with the only exception for monsoon and annual
   rainfall at Rajshahi station. Rajshahi station was the only region where
   the monsoon and annual rainfall has a significant negative trend at 95\%
   confidence limit. The sequential Mann-Kendall test detected several
   non-significant points of change for seasonal and annual rainfall at
   most of the stations. Periodic fluctuations were also detected. We
   observed that there were decreasing seasonal rainfall trend after early
   the 1990s for the majority of the stations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Cold fronts with associated westerly waves (mid-latitude low pressure
   systems: 30 degrees S-60 degrees S) move north of 30 degrees S from west
   coast of South Africa (10 degrees E or even from 40 degrees W) to west
   coast of Australia (120 degrees E) during southwest monsoon season
   (winter season: southern hemisphere). They influence Indian summer
   monsoon rainfall significantly. Geo-potential height field of 850 hPa
   levels undergoes large changes in association with the movement of cold
   fronts/upper air troughs from 040 degrees W to 120 degrees E / 140
   degrees E and north of 30 degrees S/40 degrees S during April-May.
   Moisture generated over Atlantic and Indian Oceans (from east of 40
   degrees W to 120 degrees E) by cold fronts/upper air troughs augment
   south easterly trades through low level subtropical anticyclones during
   summer monsoon season as they move eastwards and equator-wards. Positive

Abstract = {The Indian summer monsoon rainfall had three-decade long alternate dry
   and wet epochs during the 150 years from 1840 to 1989. The dry epochs
   had frequent drought monsoons affecting agriculture, power generation
   and the overall economy of the country. A high percentage of severe
   cyclones in the Bay of Bengal moved northwards during the dry epochs
   causing disasters in Bangladesh, Myanmar and the Indian states of Odisha
   and West Bengal. These dry epochs have been shown to be associated with
   the cold phase of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation in sea-surface
   temperature. Using the available tropospheric temperature (re-analysis)
   data since 1948, the recent dry epoch during 1960-89 which had 10
   monsoon drought years was found to have cold upper tropospheric
   temperature anomaly over Central Asia. This cold anomaly region has also
   experienced a long-term cooling trend. Extrapolating the naturally
   occurring epochal nature of the ocean-atmosphere system into the future,
   we fear that the epoch 2020-49 is likely to be another dry one, and the
   cooling trend over the Asian continent is likely to make it even more
   severe in its impact than 1960-89. This article presents details of an
   ocean-atmosphere instability that generates frequent drought monsoons
   during dry epochs which needs urgent research.},

Abstract = {The historical rainfall and rainy days data of Agra for the period of
   1959 to 2010 have been critically analyzed for observing any change.
   These were subjected to Mann-Kendall test, Spearman's rho test, Sen's
   slope test, Regression analysis and Change point analysis. The study
   reveals that significant decreasing trend in annual, monsoon and winter
   and August rainfall are observed at Agra, whereas May shows increasing
   rainfall. Rainy days have significantly decreasing trend in annual,
   monsoon and August. Though, rainfall in the month of May has increased
   significantly; there is no significant trend in rainy days, indicating
   an increase in rainfall intensity in the month of May. For the period
   1975-1990, Pettitt change point analysis (1979) revealed that
   significant change in rainfall and rainy days has been observed around
   1990 +/- 5 years, which is at par with the IPCC statement. The main aim
   of this paper is to address that for agricultural planning in a smaller
   area such as district level, one should go for micro level climate data
   analysis.},

Abstract = {In this paper, using the wavelet technique we analysed rainfall
   behaviour in the country across different agro-climatic zones over a
   century. Findings indicate that at the national level there is no
   significant trend in rainfall in the long run, but there are pockets of
   change in the rainfall pattern. There was a significant increase in the
   rainfall in the arid zone, whereas in the humid, semi-arid tropics and
   semi-arid temperate zones the trend was downward but insignificant. The
   behaviour of rainfall was different during this period. Except in the
   arid zone, we find a similar trend in other zones - increasing
   initially, tapering off in the middle and then declining but with some
   difference in time intervals. In the arid zone, the behaviour of
   rainfall had been erratic. In the short run, the direction of change in
   trend remains the same as in the long run but the change is
   statistically significant.},

Abstract = {The warm (cold) phase of El Nio (La Nia) and its impact on all Indian
   Summer Monsoon rainfall (AISMR) relationship is explored for the past
   100 years. The 103-year (1901-2003) data from the twentieth century
   reanalysis datasets (20CR) and other major reanalysis datasets for
   southwest monsoon season (JJAS) is utilized to find out the simultaneous
   influence of the El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-AISMR relationship.
   Two cases such as wet, dry monsoon years associated with ENSO(+) (El
   Nio), ENSO(-) (La Nia) and Non-ENSO (neutral) events have been discussed
   in detail using observed rainfall and three-dimensional 20CR dataset.
   The dry and wet years associated with ENSO and Non-ENSO periods show
   significant differences in the spatial pattern of rainfall associated
   with three-dimensional atmospheric composite, the 20CR dataset has
   captured the anomalies quite well. During wet (dry) years, the rainfall
   is high (low), i.e. 10 \% above (below) average from the long-term mean
   and this wet or dry condition occur both during ENSO and Non-ENSO
   phases. The Non-ENSO year dry or wet composites are also focused in
   detail to understand, where do the anomalous winds come from unlike in
   the ENSO case. The moisture transport is coherent with the changes in
   the spatial pattern of AISMR and large-scale feature in the 20CR
   dataset. Recent 50-year trend (1951-2000) is also analyzed from various
   available observational and reanalysis datasets to see the influence of
   Indo-Pacific SST and moist processes on the South Asian summer monsoon
   rainfall trend. Apart from the Indo-Pacific sea surface temperatures
   (SST), the moisture convergence and moisture transport among India
   (IND), Equatorial Indian Ocean (IOC) and tropical western pacific (WNP)
   is also important in modifying the wet or dry cycles over India. The
   mutual interaction among IOC, WNP and IND in seasonal timescales is
   significant in modifying wet and dry cycles over the Indian region and
   the seasonal anomalies.},

Title = {Homogeneity and trends in long-term rainfall data, Kelantan River Basin,

Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Pages = {151-163},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The Kelantan River Basin, situated in the northeastern Malaysian
   Peninsula, suffers serious flood/inundation damage, related to the
   northeast monsoon season (November-January), every few years. In this
   river basin, rainfall observation systems have been progressively
   developed since 1948, and long-term time-series data at distributed
   rainfall stations have been accumulated. This study firstly investigated
   the homogeneity of the accumulated time-series data for the purpose of
   constructing a reliable database for various hydrologic analyses. The
   homogeneity of rainfall time-series data was established using four
   absolute homogeneity tests: the Pettitt test, standard normal
   homogeneity test, Buishand range test, and von Neumann ratio test. It
   was found that among 50 rainfall stations within the river basin, 9 were
   flagged by the tests. Of these, inhomogeneous time-series data from four
   stations were omitted from further analysis. Secondly, using the
   homogenous time-series rainfall data, a trend analysis of annual
   rainfall variability was conducted by means of the Mann-Kendall (MK)
   test. To investigate long-and short-term characteristics of rainfall
   variability, three sampling methods of the MK test were applied:
   30-year, sequentially increased, and 10-year moving segmented sampling.
   The MKtest using the 30-year sampling showed a decreasing trend between
   1957 and 1987, and an increasing trend between 1981 and 2011. The MK
   test using the sequentially increased sampling detected neither
   significant increasing nor decreasing trends through the same 70-year
   period. The MK test using 10-year moving segmented sampling clearly
   showed significant rainfall variability, which corresponded to the El
   Nino and La Nina events of 1972, 1982, 1988, the mid-1990s, and
   2000-2004. Extending the plot, by comparing the turning points with the
   occurrence of El Nino and La Nina events, the results showed that the
   influence of the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) is the most likely
   to significantly influence rainfall trends in the Kelantan River Basin.},

Abstract = {The seasonality of solar irradiance and precipitation may regulate
   seasonal variations in tropical forests carbon cycling. Controversy
   remains over their importance as drivers of seasonal dynamics of net
   primary productivity in tropical forests. We use ground data from nine
   lowland Amazonian forest plots collected over 3 years to quantify the
   monthly primary productivity (NPP) of leaves, reproductive material,
   woody material, and fine roots over an annual cycle. We distinguish
   between forests that do not experience substantial seasonal moisture
   stress ({''}humid sites{''}) and forests that experience a stronger dry
   season ({''}dry sites{''}). We find that forests from both precipitation
   regimes maximize leaf NPP over the drier season, with a peak in
   production in August at both humid (mean 0.39 +/- 0.03 MgC ha(-1)
   month(-1) in July, n = 4) and dry sites (mean 0.49 +/- 0.03 Mg C ha(-1)
   month(-1) in September, n = 8). We identify two distinct seasonal carbon
   allocation patterns (the allocation of NPP to a specific organ such as
   wood leaves or fine roots divided by total NPP). The forests monitored
   in the present study show evidence of either (i) constant allocation to
   roots and a seasonal trade-off between leaf and woody material or (ii)
   constant allocation to wood and a seasonal trade-off between roots and
   leaves. Finally, we find strong evidence of synchronized flowering at
   the end of the dry season in both precipitation regimes. Flower
   production reaches a maximum of 0.047 +/- 0.013 and 0.031 +/- 0.004 MgC
   ha(-1) month(-1) in November, in humid and dry sites, respectively.
   Fruitfall production was staggered throughout the year, probably
   reflecting the high variation in varying times to development and loss
   of fruit among species.},

Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Rainfall is a key component of the hydrological cycle, and its
   spatiotemporal variability is essential from the both scientific and
   practical perspectives. This study is focused on analysis of temporal
   variability and trends in historical rainfall records for stations in
   the Geba River basin. The Geba catchment is surrounded by the Danakil
   basin in the east, by the Tekeze River basin in the south, and the Werie
   River basin in the west which is located in the northern Ethiopia
   regional state of Tigray between 38 degrees 38' E and 39 degrees 48' E
   and 13 degrees 18' N and 14 degrees 15' N. The climate over the basin is
   semi-arid and has large elevation differences varying from 926 to 3301 m
   above mean sea level. Daily rainfall data of 43 years measured at seven
   stations in the basin for the period of 1971 to 2013 for annual and
   seasonal rainfall trends have been processed and used for the analysis.
   The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the Sen's slope estimator have
   been used to identify the existence of trends and slope magnitude in
   rainfall. Results revealed that although there was a mix of positive and
   negative trends, they were no statistically significant except at one
   station which showed an increasing trend in annual rainfall. Considering
   rainfall in different seasons, an increase in rainfall was observed in
   two stations in the wet season which, however, was not statistically
   significant. For the remaining stations, a weak decline in wet season
   rainfall (not statistically significant at 95 \% confidence level) for
   four stations and absence of trend for one station were noticed.
   Furthermore, no statistically significant trend (positive or negative)
   was evident for the dry season rainfall. Results of this study may prove
   useful in the preparation of climate change mitigation and adaptation
   strategies in rainfed agricultural and water supply systems in the
   region.},

Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Climate and land use changes impact hydrological records and especially
   precipitation time series, which have significance priority in any water
   resource planning, operation, management, and maintenance studies. In
   this paper, Macta watershed monthly precipitation records at 25 stations
   are studies by the innovative trend analysis method application in order
   to identify the climatological tendencies in each station leading to the
   regional variation pattern in the precipitation over the study area. For
   this purpose, innovative trend template is prepared separately for each
   station. The comparison of the arithmetic averages provides the trend
   slope in the meteorological records and the standard deviations provide
   a measure of variability. These templates also provide qualitative
   interpretations about the ``low,{''} ``medium,{''} and ``high{''}
   precipitation range trends. It is noticed that there is the sub-region
   of decreasing trends in the northern part close to the Mediterranean Sea
   coastal area in the Macta basin, whereas at the south, the trends are in
   the increasing style. It is noticed from the quantitative analysis that
   in the Macta watershed ``low{''} and ``medium{''} rainfall ranges have
   commonly no-trend cases, but ``high{''} rainfall values have decreasing

Abstract = {Pre-monsoon (March, April and May - MAM) rainfall over India is highly
   variable. A pre-whitened Mann-Kendall test was used to investigate
   trends in rainfall during MAM. The results indicate the presence of a
   significant (at the 10\% level) increasing trend at four stations
   (Ajmer, Bikaner, Indore and Kolkata), out of which two stations (Ajmer
   and Bikaner) show a statistically significant increasing trend. A
   decreasing trend is observed at two stations (Belgaum and Minicoy).
   Practical significance was also explored in terms of percentage changes,
   using the Theil-Sen median slope estimator. Forecasts made using a
   univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for
   MAM indicate that there has been a significant rise in the pre-monsoon
   rainfall over the northwestern part of India.},

Abstract = {Rain gauge studies have shown that the incidence of rain at rates
   associated with outage on terrestrial links has shown an increasing
   trend in several countries over the last 30years. However, no evidence
   is available from microwave links to show whether outage rates, or the
   incidence of fade, is similarly increasing. This paper presents evidence
   of fade trends, derived from a decade of rain radar data. Although a
   decade is too short a period to observe rain rate trends, evidence is
   presented that trends in the size of rain events is leading to changes
   in the relationship between point rain rates and rain fade. Furthermore,
   these trends are shown to vary significantly across the UK. Temporal
   trends in both rain rates and their link to rain fade, make it more
   difficult to adapt International Telecommunication Union
   Radiocommunication Reccomendations to a changing climate.},

Abstract = {In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of trends in the
   extremes during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) months (June to
   September) at different temporal and spatial scales. Our goal is to
   identify and quantify spatiotemporal patterns and trends that have
   emerged during the recent decades and may be associated with changing
   climatic conditions. Our analysis primarily relies on quantile
   regression that avoids making any subjective choices on spatial,
   temporal, or intensity pattern of extreme rainfall events. Our analysis
   divides the Indian monsoon region into climatic compartments that show
   different and partly opposing trends. These include strong trends toward
   intensified droughts in Northwest India, parts of Peninsular India, and
   Myanmar; in contrast, parts of Pakistan, Northwest Himalaya, and Central
   India show increased extreme daily rain intensity leading to higher
   flood vulnerability. Our analysis helps explain previously contradicting
   results of trends in average ISM rainfall.},

Title = {Analysis of trends in streamflow and its linkages with rainfall and

Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {123},

Abstract = {Trend analysis of hydro-climatic variables such as streamflow, rainfall,
   and temperature provides useful information for effective water
   resources planning, designing, and management. Trends in observed
   streamflow at four gauging stations in the Gomti River basin of North
   India were assessed using the Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope for the 1982
   to 2012 period. The relationships between trends in streamflow and
   rainfall were studied by correlation analyses. There was a gradual
   decreasing trend of annual, monsoonal, and winter seasonal streamflow (p
   < 0.05) from the midstream to the downstream of the river and also a
   decreasing trend of annual streamflow for the 5-year moving averaged
   standardized anomalies of streamflow for the entire basin. The declining
   trend in the streamflow was attributed partly to the increased water
   withdrawal, to increased air temperature, to higher population, and
   partly to significant reducing trend of post monsoon rainfall especially
   at downstream. Upstream gauging station showed a significant increasing
   trend of streamflow (1.6 m(3)/s/year) at annual scale, and this trend
   was attributed to the significant increasing trend of catchment rainfall
   (9.54 mm/year). It was further evident in the significant coefficient of
   positive correlation (rho = 0.8) between streamflow and catchment
   rainfall. The decreasing trend in streamflow and post-monsoon rainfall
   especially towards downstream area with concurrent increasing trend of
   temperature indicates a drying tendency of the Gomti River basin over
   the study period. The results of this study may help stakeholders to
   design streamflow restoration strategies for sustainable water
   management planning of the Gomti River basin.},

Title = {A multi-decadal assessment of the performance of gauge- and model-based
   rainfall products over Saudi Arabia: climatology, anomalies and trends},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {656-674},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many arid and semi-arid regions have sparse precipitation observing
   networks, which limits the capacity for detailed hydrological modelling,
   water resources management and flood forecasting efforts. The objective
   of this work is to evaluate the utility of relatively high-spatial
   resolution rainfall products to reproduce observed multi-decadal
   rainfall characteristics such as climatologies, anomalies and trends
   over Saudi Arabia. Our study compares the statistical characteristics of
   rainfall from 53 observatories over the reference period 1965-2005, with
   rainfall data from six widely used gauge-based products, including
   APHRODITE, GPCC, PRINCETON, UDEL, CRU and PREC/L. In addition, the
   performance of three global climate models (GCMs), including CCSM4,
   EC-EARTH and MRI-I-CGCM3, integrated as part of the Fifth Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), was also evaluated. Results indicate
   that the gauge-based products were generally skillful in reproducing
   rainfall characteristics in Saudi Arabia. In most cases, the gauge-based
   products were also able to capture the annual cycle, anomalies and
   climatologies of observed data, although significant inter-product
   variability was observed, depending on the assessment metric being used.
   In comparison, the GCM-based products generally exhibited poor
   performance, with larger biases and very weak correlations, particularly
   during the summertime. Importantly, all products generally failed to
   reproduce the observed long-term seasonal and annual trends in the
   region, particularly during the dry seasons (summer and autumn).
   Overall, this work suggests that selected gauge-based products with
   daily (APHRODITE and PRINCETON) and monthly (GPCC and CRU) resolutions
   show superior performance relative to other products, implying that they
   may be the most appropriate data source from which multi-decadal
   variations of rainfall can be investigated at the regional scale over
   Saudi Arabia. Discriminating these skillful products is important not
   only for reducing uncertainty in climate, hydrological and environmental
   assessments but also for advancing model developments in the region.},

Title = {Estimation of trends in rainfall extremes with mixed effects models},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {24-32},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Estimates of seasonal rainfall maxima at durations as short as 6 min are
   needed for many applications including the design and analysis of urban
   drainage systems. It is also important to investigate whether or not
   there is evidence of changes in these extremes, both as an indicator of
   the sensitivity of rainfall to anthropogenic and natural climate change
   and as an aid to the calibration of future scenarios. Estimation of
   trends in extreme values in a region needs to be based on all the
   available data if precision is to be achieved. However, extremes at
   different periods of accumulation at neighbouring sites are not
   independent because there are temporal and spatial correlations,
   respectively. A linear mixed effects (Ime) model allows for this
   correlation structure, and can be fitted to unequal record lengths at
   different sites. The modelling technique is demonstrated with an
   analysis of monthly maximum rainfall, at nine aggregations between 6 min
   and 24 h, from six sites, with record lengths between 10 and 25 years,
   from a region in South Australia. In terms of mean value, there is no
   evidence of a trend or change in the seasonal distribution of the
   monthly extreme rainfall. However, there is a strong evidence of an
   increase in variability of monthly extreme rainfall, estimated as a 58\%
   increase in absolute value of deviation from the mean over a 25 year
   period. Rainfall records are often only available as a daily
   accumulation. A formula for the ratio of the monthly maxima at durations
   shorter than 24 h, down to 6 min, to the 24 h monthly maximum, in terms
   of: duration, month of the year, and a site specific adjustment is
   estimated. There is a clear seasonal variation in the ratios and there
   is evidence of a difference between rainfall stations. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {Modelling rainfall trends in England and Wales},
Journal = {COGENT GEOSCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The monthly England and Wales precipitation (EWP) series (once power
   transformed to induce symmetry and to stabilise variance) may be
   characterised as having linear seasonal trends with a white noise error
   process superimposed. However, these trends are not stable, for they are
   interrupted by four regime shifts occurring in 1828, 1871, 1917 and
   1976. If these shifts are ignored then the series is consistent with a
   trend pattern in which winters are becoming increasingly wet and summers
   drier. If only the last regime from 1976 is considered, then summers are
   still becoming drier but winters have no trend, with spring becoming
   wetter. The unusually wet winter of 2014 is seen to have been a
   consequence of very high January and February rainfall relative to that
   predicted, the conjunction of which is unprecedented during the two and
   a half centuries over which the EWP series has been available, during
   which time such pairs of values have been essentially uncorrelated.},

Abstract = {We studied rainfall characteristics of Brazil for the period 1979-2011.
   This is an update for an earlier study with data from 1958 to 1978. We
   compared the three consecutive wet and dry months in the two data sets.
   In the northern most part rainy season earlier was in April to July and
   now it is occurring later. In a large part of the south central region
   the rainy season in austral summer and dry season in austral winter did
   not change. However, to the east of this region rainy season in the
   latter data occurs earlier. Calculation of linear tendencies showed,
   that over the northern Amazon region there is a significant increase of
   rainfall. This agreed with previous results. Over this region dry season
   is becoming drier and wet season wetter. In the west of Northeast Brazil
   (NEB) there is an increase of rainfall. In southeast Brazil there is a
   region of highly significant decrease of rainfall in both wet and dry
   seasons. This is confirmed in our analysis on river discharges in Sao
   Paulo and Minas Gerais states. The negative tendencies in rainfall have
   great impact on the hydroelectric generation not only in this region but
   also at the national level because the hydroelectric dams furnish energy
   on a national level. The increase in rainfall in Northern Amazon is
   probably associated with Atlantic warming that resulted in higher
   moisture transport from east. The decrease of rainfall in southeast
   Brazil seems to be associated with the plummet of rain producing systems
   from south due to increase of mean sea level pressure in the south.},

Volume = {25},

Abstract = {In hydraulic engineering, it is of vital importance to estimate
   suspended load correctly in planning and projecting stream structures.
   On the other hand, problems increase with the effect of heating and
   climate changes in a globalizing world, and it is thought that the
   decrease of usable freshwater sources would pose a serious risk. Due to
   these risks, studies on the potential effect of climate change and on
   hydraulic time series have increased in recent years. Therefore, in this
   study, the trend analysis method will be applied to annual average
   rainfall, stream flow and suspended load of West, East Black Sea Basins
   and Sakarya Basin. While there was no trend in the data of most stations
   obtained from West Black Sea Basin, there was a decreasing trend in the
   data of some stations in stream flow and suspended load. While there was
   an increase trend in data of most stations obtained from rainfall
   stations for East Black Sea Basin, there was no trend in the data of
   some stations in stream flow and suspended load data. There was a
   decrease trend in data of most of the stations obtained from rainfall,
   stream flow and suspended load measurement stations for Sakarya},

Title = {Assessment and reconstruction of catchment streamflow trends and
   variability in response to rainfall across Victoria, Australia},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-60},
Abstract = {Catchments in Victoria, Australia, are essential to the state's water
   supply, yet have experienced increased stress over the last 30 yr. To
   gain a better understanding of streamflow variability, 27 catchments
   across the state were analysed: the majority showed a declining trend in
   streamflow from 1977-2012, which was largest in the far west and east of
   the state and smallest close to the Australian Alps. The same spatial
   pattern was observed for the streamflow reduction during the Millennium
   Drought. The response of streamflow across the state is strongly related
   to the mean runoff rather than the pattern of rainfall reduction. In
   terms of large-scale climate forcings, strong correlations were found
   during the cool season with the subtropical ridge intensity and to a
   lesser extent with its position. Tropical modes of variability are
   important in catchments other than those on the southern flank of the
   Great Dividing Range; however, they do not explain the streamflow
   reduction during the Millennium Drought. A simple linear regression was
   tested based on a temporal range of rainfall parameters with short (from
   1 mo) to long (up to 10 yr) memory, combined with temperature, to
   reconstruct streamflow. High correlations were found between observed
   and best-reconstructed monthly streamflow. The reconstruction was able
   to capture the long-term trends and the magnitude of the Millennium
   Drought well, an important step toward the application of the method to
   generate streamflow projections using downscaled rainfall from climate
   models.},

Title = {Variability and Trend of Annual Maximum Daily Rainfall in Northern
   Algeria},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {The daily rainfall dataset of 35 weather stations covering the north of
   Algeria was studied for a period up to 43 years, recorded after 1970s.
   The variability and trends in annual maximum daily rainfall (AMDR) time
   series and their contributions in annual rainfall (AR) were
   investigated. The analysis of the series was based on statistical
   characteristics, Burn's seasonality procedure, Mann-Kendall test, and
   linear regression technique. The contribution of the AMDR to AR analysis
   was subjected to both the Buishand test and the double mass curve
   technique. The AMDR characteristics reveal a strong temporal
   irregularity and have a wide frequency of occurrence in the months of
   November and December while the maximum intensity occurred in October.
   The observed phenomenon was so irregular that there was no dominant
   season and the occurrence of extreme event can arrive at any time of the
   year. The AMDR trends showed that only six of 35 stations have
   significant trend. For other stations, no clear trend was highlighted.
   This result was confirmed by the linear regression procedure. On the
   contrary, the contribution of AMDR in annual totals exhibited a
   significant increasing trend for 57\% of the sites studied with a growth
   rate of up to 50\%.},

Title = {Transition of dominant peak flow source from snowmelt to rainfall along
   the Colorado Front Range: Historical patterns, trends, and lessons from
   the 2013 Colorado Front Range floods},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {52},

Pages = {407-422},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Colorado Front Range has a large elevation gradient with deep
   seasonal snowpack in the mountains and limited snow accumulation in the
   foothills and plains. This study examines how the sources of annual peak
   flows (snowmelt, rainfall, mixed) change with the fraction of time snow
   persists on the ground, snow persistence (SP), and whether these sources
   have changed over time. Sources of peak flows for 20 gaging stations are
   estimated using a gridded rain and snow model forced with PRISM daily
   precipitation and both PRISM and TopoWx temperature. The mean snowmelt
   contribution to peak flow is highly correlated with SP (r(2) =
   0.86-0.90). Watersheds with S P< 0.3 (low snow, elevation <2000 m) are
   rainfall-dominated, and watersheds with SP > 0.7 (persistent snow,
   elevation >3100 m) are mostly snowmelt-dominated, with mixed sources
   between these thresholds. Rainfall runoff peak flows are possible at all
   elevations, but their likelihood declines with increasing SP. Rainfall
   runoff from an extreme storm in September 2013 produced the highest
   annual peaks at many stations, including some snowmelt-dominated
   watersheds. Regional Kendall trend tests indicate that the contributions
   of snowmelt to peak flows and total annual inputs have declined in the
   mixed source zone. These changes may affect hydrographs, as analyses
   confirm that snowmelt runoff generally produces more attenuated peaks
   than rainfall runoff. Discrimination of peak flow source is sensitive to
   input data and model structure for mixed rain and snowmelt events, and
   both observation and modeling research are needed to help understand
   potential runoff changes in these conditions.},

Title = {Assessment of Seasonal and Annual Rainfall Trends and Variability in
   Sharjah City, UAE},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Although a few studies on rainfall spatial and temporal variability in
   the UAE have been carried out, evidence of the impact of climate change
   on rainfall trends has not been reported. This study aims at assessing
   the significance of long-term rainfall trends and temporal variability
   at Sharjah City, UAE. Annual rainfall and seasonal rainfall extending
   over a period of 81 years (19342014) recorded at Sharjah International
   Airport have been analyzed. To this end, several parametric and
   nonparametric statistical measures have been applied following
   systematic data quality assessment. The analyses revealed that the
   annual rainfall trend decreased from -3mm to -9.4mm per decade over the
   study periods. The decreasing annual rainfall trend is mainly driven by
   the significant drop in winter rainfall, particularly during the period
   from 1977 to 2014. The results also indicate that high probability
   extreme events have shifted toward low frequency (12.7 years) with
   significant variations in monthly rainfall patterns and periodicity. The
   findings of the present study suggest reevaluating the derivation of
   design rainfall for infrastructure of Sharjah City and urge developing
   an integrated framework for its water resources planning and risk under
   climate change impacts scenarios.},

Title = {Geospatial Trends and Decadal Anomalies in Extreme Rainfall over Uganda,
   East Africa},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Trends and variability in series comprising the mean of fifteen highest
   daily rainfall intensities in each year were analyzed considering entire
   Uganda. The data were extracted from high-resolution (0.5 degrees x 0.5
   degrees) gridded daily series of the Princeton Global Forcings covering
   the period 1948-2008. Variability was analyzed using nonparametric
   anomaly indicator method and empirical orthogonal functions. Possible
   drivers of the rainfall variability were investigated. Trends were
   analyzed using the cumulative rank difference approach. Generally,
   rainfall was above the long-term mean from the mid-1950s to the late
   1960s and again in the 1990s. From around 1970 to the late 1980s,
   rainfall was characterized by a decrease. The first and second dominant
   modes of variability correspond with the variation in Indian Ocean
   Dipole and North Atlantic Ocean index, respectively. The influence of
   Nino 3 on the rainfall variability of some parts of the country was also
   evident. The southern and northern parts had positive and negative
   trends, respectively. The null hypothesis H-0 (no trend) was
   collectively rejected at the significance level of 5\% in the series
   from 7 out of 168 grid points. The insights from the findings of this
   study are vital for planning and management of risk-based water
   resources applications.},

   phenomenon has already begun to transform the rainfall patterns in
   Malaysia. It was clearly proven when the northern and eastern states of
   Peninsular Malaysia such as Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Perak and
   Johor were hit by the catastrophic floods in December 2014, events that
   have been described as the worst in decades. Although there are a number
   of studies in climate change and extreme rainfall events in Malaysia,
   there are still large knowledge gaps about their relationship.
   Understanding the shifts and predicting changing trends in rainfall
   distribution is needed for predicting and managing the floods. In this
   paper, Mann Kendall (MK) test and Sen's Slope estimator are employed to
   determine the trend of extreme rainfall events of various storm
   durations in the Pahang and Kelantan river basins. The results indicate
   that annual maximum daily rainfall for Pahang River basin and Kelantan
   River basin increased throughout 45 years. Results show that the
   percentage of stations with statistically significant trend (at 0.05
   significance level) in the Kelantan River basin are higher compared to
   the Pahang River basin. Percentage of stations showing increasing trends
   were much higher for short duration rainfall (10, 30 and 60 minutes and
   3 hours) compared to long duration rainfall (6, 12, 24, 48, 120 and 240
   hours). This study will be useful for planning, designing and managing
   floods and stormwater systems in this area. (C) 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to characterize Mediterranean
   rainfall spatiotemporal features from 1950 to 2013, with a focus on
   intense events. Results show a general decrease in precipitation amounts
   during the September to April period. The Mediterranean Basin also shows
   a strong decrease in the number of rainy days in northern Portugal,
   Algeria, northeast Anatolia, in southern Balkans and in almost all of
   Italy. In the current context of global warming, changes in intense
   Mediterranean precipitation events remain less obvious, with no
   significant evolutions in the number and intensities of such events.
   Only few zones such as southwest Anatolia, eastern Balkans and parts of
   the Iberian Peninsula, show an increase in the contribution of intense
   rainfall in the total precipitation amount over the 1950-2013 period.},

Title = {Trends in grain production and yield gaps in the high-rainfall zone of

Journal = {CROP \& PASTURE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {67},

Pages = {921-937},
Abstract = {The high-rainfall zone (HRZ) of southern Australia is the arable areas
   where annual rainfall is between 450 and 800 mm in Western Australia and
   between 500 and 900 mm in south-eastern Australia, resulting in a
   growing-season length of 7-10 months. In the last decade, there has been
   a growing recognition of the potential to increase crop production in
   the HRZ. We combined (1) a survey of 15 agricultural consultants, each
   of whom have similar to 40-50 farmer clients across the HRZ, (2) 28 farm
   records of crop yields and area for 2000-2010, (3) 86 wheat and 54
   canola yield observations from well managed experiments, and (4)
   long-term simulated crop yields at 13 HRZ locations, to investigate
   recent trends in crop production, quantify the gap between potential and
   actual crop yields, and consider the factors thought to limit on-farm
   crop yields in the HRZ. We found in the past 10 years a trend towards
   more cropping, particularly in WA, an increased use of canola, and
   advances in the adaptation of germplasm to HRZ environments using winter
   and longer-season spring types. Consultants and the farm survey data
   confirmed that the rate of future expansion of cropping in the HRZ will
   slow, especially when compared with the rapid changes seen in the 1990s.
   In Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia the long-term
   water-limited potential yield in HRZ areas, as measured by experimental
   yields, consultant estimates and simulations for slow developing spring
   cultivars of wheat and canola was 5-6 and 2-3 t/ha for a decile 5
   season. For Western Australia it was 4-5 and 2-3 t/ha, where yields were
   less responsive to good seasons than in the other states. The top
   performing farmers were achieving close to the water-limited potential
   yield. There are yield advantages of similar to 2 t/ha for `winter' over
   `spring' types of both wheat and canola, and there is scope for better
   adapted germplasm to further raise potential yield in the HRZ.
   Consultants stated that there is scope for large gains in yield and
   productivity by encouraging the below-average cropping farmers to adopt
   the practices and behaviours of the above-average farmers. The scope for
   improvement between the below- and above-average farmers was 1-3 t/ha
   for wheat and 0.5-1.5 t/ha for canola in a decile 5 season. They also
   stated that a lack of up-to-date infrastructure (e.g. farm grain
   storage) and services is constraining the industry's ability to adopt
   new technology. Priorities for future research, development and
   extension among consultants included: overcoming yield constraints where
   growing-season rainfall exceeds 350 mm; adaptation of winter and
   long-season spring types of cereals and canola and management of inputs
   required to express their superior yield potential; and overcoming
   barriers to improved planning and timeliness for crop operations and
   adoption of technology.},

Title = {Analysis of Extreme Rainfall Trends in Sicily for the Evaluation of
   Depth-Duration-Frequency Curves in Climate Change Scenarios},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {The design of urban drainage systems and the development of flood
   mitigation strategies commonly require knowledge of extreme rainfall for
   a given return period. In the context of climate variability that is no
   longer imputable to only natural forces, the estimation of this variable
   represents a critical issue. Climate change effects, particularly on
   precipitation, should be considered in the design and planning of
   hydraulics infrastructures. The aim of this study is to provide an
   assessment of the effects of statistically significant trends in extreme
   rainfall on the rainfall depth-duration-frequency (DDF) curves for the
   return periods typically used in design in order to obtain useful
   information for the definition of DDF curves in climate change
   scenarios. The study was applied in Sicily, in the center of the
   Mediterranean Area, because the study may provide interesting insights
   in a highly populated coastal region. The first step of the study
   consisted of the detection and quantification of trends in the annual
   maximum rainfall series of different durations (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h)
   observed in Sicily. The annual maximum rainfall series recorded using 65
   rain gauges over the period 1950-2008 has been selected and analyzed.
   For each duration, the moving averages have been computed and then the
   Mann-Kendall test has been applied, considering different levels of
   confidence. The results showed that, for all the durations, increasing
   and decreasing trends occurred over the examined period. Once trends
   have been detected and quantified, the generalized extreme value
   distribution (GEV) has been employed to compute extreme rainfall with
   return periods equal to 5, 10, and 20 years. Finally, the parameters of
   the DDF curves have been updated for the Sicilian rain gauges,
   incorporating the information obtained from the trend analysis carried
   out on the local scale. The updating of the DDF parameters has been
   carried out by defining two climate scenarios on the basis of the trend
   analysis results. For each duration, results showed that, in the area of
   study, extreme rainfall series have been affected by both negative and
   positive statistically significant trends. (C) 2015 American Society of

Abstract = {The coastlines have been identified as the most vulnerable regions with
   respect to hydrological hazards as a result of climate change and
   variability. The east of peninsular Malaysia is not an exception for
   this, considering the evidence of heavy rainfall resulting in floods as

   the region. This study examines recent trends in rainfall and
   rainfall-related extremes such as, maximum daily rainfall, number of
   rainy days, average rainfall intensity, heavy rainfall days, extreme
   rainfall days, and precipitation concentration index in the east coast
   of peninsular Malaysia. Recent 40 years (1971-2010) rainfall records
   from 54 stations along the east coast of peninsular Malaysia have been
   analyzed using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the Sen's slope
   method. The Monte Carlo simulation technique has been used to determine
   the field significance of the regional trends. The results showed that
   there was a substantial increase in the annual rainfall as well as the
   rainfall during the monsoon period. Also, there was an increase in the
   number of heavy rainfall days during the past four decades.},

Title = {Uncertainty Analysis in the Evaluation of Extreme Rainfall Trends and

Abstract = {Future projections provided by climate models suggest that the
   occurrence of extreme rainfall events will increase and this is evidence
   that the climate is changing. Because the design of urban drainage
   systems is based on the statistical analysis of past events, variations
   in the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall represent a critical
   issue for the estimation of rainfall. For this reason, the design
   criteria of drainage systems should take into account the trends in the
   past and the future climate changes projections. To this end, a Bayesian
   procedure was proposed to update the parameters of
   depth-duration-frequency (DDF) curves to assess the uncertainty related
   to the estimation of these values, once the evidence of annual maximum
   rainfall trends was verified. Namely, in the present study, the
   historical extreme rainfall series with durations of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24
   h for the period of 1950-2008, recorded by the rain gauges located near
   the Paceco urban area (southern Italy), were analyzed to detect
   statistically significant trends using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall
   test. Based on the rainfall trends, the parameters of the DDF curves for
   a five-year return period were updated to define some climate scenarios.
   Finally, the implications of the uncertainty related to the DDF
   parameters estimation on the design of a real urban drainage system was
   assessed to provide an evaluation of its performance under the
   assumption of climate change. Results showed that the future increase of
   annual maximum precipitation in the area of study would affect the
   analyzed drainage system, which could face more frequent episodes of
   surcharge.},

Abstract = {The long rains season of East Africa has recently experienced a series
   of devastating droughts, whereas the majority of climate models predict
   increasing rainfall for the coming decades. This has been termed the
   East African climate paradox and has implications for developing viable
   adaptation policies. A logical framework is adopted that leads to six
   key hypotheses that could explain this paradox. The first hypothesis
   that the recent observed trend is due to poor quality data is promptly
   rejected. An initial judgment on the second hypothesis that the
   projected trend is founded on poor modeling is beyond the scope of a
   single study. Analysis of a natural variability hypothesis suggests this
   is unlikely to have been the dominant driver of recent droughts,
   although it may have contributed. The next two hypotheses explore
   whether the balance between competing forcings could be changing.
   Regarding the possibility that the past trend could be due to changing
   anthropogenic aerosol emissions, the results of sensitivity experiments
   are highly model dependent, but some show a significant impact on the
   patterns of tropical SST trends, aspects of which likely caused the
   recent long rains droughts. Further experiments suggest land-use changes
   are unlikely to have caused the recent droughts. The last hypothesis
   that the response to CO2 emissions is nonlinear explains no more than
   10\% of the contrast between recent and projected trends. In conclusion,
   it is recommended that research priorities now focus on providing a
   process-based expert judgment of the reliability of East Africa
   projections, improving the modeling of aerosol impacts on rainfall, and
   better understanding the relevant natural variability.},

Title = {Extraction of Nonlinear Rainfall Trends Using Singular Spectrum Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rainfall plays a crucial role in the socioeconomic development of a
   country. Knowledge of both the amount of rainfall and its pattern of
   distribution are equally important for proper management of water
   resources systems. In the present study, trends of two rainfall series
   from different locations having different time periods and time steps
   have been extracted using the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method.
   Data analyzed include monthly data of England and Wales precipitation
   (EWP) from 1766 to 2002 in which no periodic component is prevailing and
   daily rainfall data of Koyna watershed, Maharashtra, India from 1961 to
   2009, which shows a strong periodic component of 365 days. Method of
   periodogram analysis has been used in order to select the components
   corresponding to trend in the grouping stage of SSA. The Mann-Kendall
   (MK) test is also used to detect trends in EWP monthly series and the
   performance of SSA and MK test is compared. The result showed that the
   MK test could detect the presence of a positive or negative trend at a
   significant level, whereas the proposed SSA method could extract the
   nonlinear trend present in the series along with its shape. Trends
   extracted from the England and Wales precipitation are compared with a
   previously published EWP trend extraction study. The comparison shows
   that the method of SSA in trend extraction could extract nonlinear
   trends along with its shape whereas the previous study extracted linear
   trends. The EWP monthly rainfall series showed an increasing trend
   during the winter season and a decreasing trend during summer. The trend
   extracted for the Koyna series has very small values (almost constant),
   implying that the rainfall series is almost stationary. The study proves
   the applicability of SSA for extracting nonlinear trends that provide
   more insight into the observed time series. (C) 2015 American Society of

Title = {The role of external forcing in prolonged trends in Australian rainfall},
Journal = {CLIMATE DYNAMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {2455-2468},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Based on model output from a multi-model ensemble (MME) of coupled
   atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, it is shown that prolonged
   trends in Australian rainfall over the southwest during winter and the
   monsoonal northwest during summer are associated with trends in the
   large scale Southern Hemisphere circulation. These trends, in turn, are
   the result of external radiative forcing, including anthropogenic
   greenhouse gases, ozone, aerosols and land use change. The MME is used
   in an analysis of covariance method to separate the internal (natural)
   variability in the coupled rainfall-atmospheric circulation relationship
   from influences associated with anomalous external radiative forcing. In
   both seasons, the leading coupled external mode (singular vector) in the
   twentieth century runs has rainfall and circulation loading patterns
   with associated time-series that have statistically significant trends.
   The associated rainfall loading patterns qualitatively resemble the
   patterns of observed rainfall trends. The circulation loading patterns
   reflect the thermal expansion of the tropics and the Hadley Cell. A
   comparison between similar analyses using the second half of the
   twenty-first century of the representative concentration pathways (RCP)
   RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios show that trends in rainfall and the
   circulation are projected to continue and intensify under increasing
   anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The technique developed
   here is generally applicable to separate the climate change signal from
   natural variability in any relevant pair of coupled climate fields.},

Title = {Daily rainfall data to identify trends in rainfall amount and
   rainfall-induced agricultural events in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {16-26},

Abstract = {Widely variable inter- and intra-seasonal rainfall increases risks of
   agricultural production in the Nuba Mountains of Sudan, which are one of
   the country's most vulnerable areas with respect to climate change. This
   study aims to identify trends in rainfall amount at different temporal
   resolutions as well as changes and probabilities of rainfall-induced
   agricultural events. Long-term daily rainfall records (60 years) from
   two weather stations, Kadugli and Rashad, were computed to daily,
   monthly and annual values and rainfall-induced events were computed
   using the INSTAT + software. Subsequently, these calculated values and
   events were checked for possible monotonic trends from 1950 to 2009 and
   1970 to 2009 by Mann-Kendall tests.
   Over the period from 1970 to 2009, annual rainfall showed no
   statistically significant change for either station. However, during
   this period an increase of low rainfall events (>0.85 mm to <= 3 mm) by
   15 days coinciding with a decline in the number of medium daily rainfall
   classes (>10 mm to <= 20 mm) by 4 days was observed in Rashad. This
   increase is of concern since low rainfall events do not contribute to
   the crop water balance and therefore may thus be largely irrelevant for
   rainfed farmers' crop production. Furthermore, daily rainfall data
   enabled frequency calculations of a successful or failed start of the
   growing season, of high intensity rainfall events (90th, 95th and 99th
   percentiles) and of different dry spell length classes (>7, >14 and >21
   days; 1 to <= 7 days, 8 to <= 14, 15 to <= 21 and >21). Additionally,
   probability calculations of the minimum lengths of growing season and
   the occurring of dry spell lengths based on specific dates were
   conducted. Since for these rainfall-induced agricultural events either
   no statistically significant changes or trends resulting only in minor
   changes of probabilities were observed, our risk statements seem to be
   reliable for the next years. The results of this study may contribute to
   a better assessment of crop management risks under rainfed farming in
   the Nuba Mountains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Historical data on climatic parameters as well as yield data on maize
   are important to look into past setbacks and achievements. In the
   present study, we have analysed the grain yield of the best entry, the
   best check and trial mean of full season maturity group grown during the
   monsoon (kharif)season in All India Coordinated Maize Improvement
   Project (AICMIP) trials from 1991 to 2012 in four agro-climatic zones of
   the country. The monthly fluctuations in rainfall during maize cropping
   season are high in all the zones during maize crop season and the trend
   was significantly increasing in the month of August in Zone V. The
   seasonal rainfall decreased during the month of October in all the
   Zones. The yield performance of best test entry was at par or higher
   than the best check with significant and strong correlation with each
   other and with trial mean. There was increasing trend for maize yields
   from 1991 to 2012 in all the zones. The new maize hybrids from AICMIP
   are superior even under the changing climatic conditions in different
   agro-climatic zones, however, there was a stabilization of the zonal
   yields (pooled over states within agro-climatic zones) of maize around
   year 2002 for 7 to 12 years in different zones of the country. In spite
   of high fluctuations in rainfall, there was continuous improvement in
   the new genotypes developed at AICMIP especially in past two decades.
   Thus, AICMIP had an important contribution in overall increase in zonal
   yields of the country even though the differential impact in different
   zones. The impact of new hybrids in zonal or state productivity and
   production took less time for Zone II and Zone III and this impact
   lasted for more years in Zone II than Zone III.},

Abstract = {The Valencia lake basin is the endorheic watershed larger of Venezuela
   (VLB). VLB is densely populated and industrialized; therefore the
   extreme climate events can cause severe impacts. In the Venezuelan
   territory, it is known that ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) can
   modulate the rainfalls, however no has been explored in detail as ENSO
   can affect the rainfalls on VLB. This study analyzes the spatio-temporal
   trends of the seasonal rainfalls and explores the association between
   the occurrence of extreme rainfall months and the phases of ENSO (El
   Nino, La Nina and Neutral) on VLB. Eight stations were selected by the
   quality control of their registers. We considered two periods for our
   analysis: 1934-2005 (local scale) and 1966-1992 (regional-local scale).
   In addition, were identified the months of occurrence of the rainy and
   dry seasons. The accumulated rainfall by season in each station was
   calculated and after was explored the occurrence of a long-term trend by
   Mann-Kendall test. Seasonal precipitation in each station and season was
   categorized in extreme dry, extreme-no, or extreme wet (ED, EN and EW)
   using the 10th and 90th percentiles as threshold. The likelihood of
   occurrence of a month ED, EN or EW at local scale according to season
   and phase of ENSO was estimated. The association between these
   categorical variables was analyzed by chi-square test for independence.
   The results more remarkable were: there is no evidence of a long-term
   trend at local scale on seasonal precipitation; the Nino/Nina episodes
   are partially associated with the occurrence of extreme rainfall at
   seasonal scale; a high-proportion of the extreme rainfall events could
   have been driven by local factors which were not evaluated here.},

Abstract = {Rainfall extremes are thought to have increased over recent years.
   Typically linear trends have been considered to describe the temporal
   evolution of high quantiles of the daily rainfall distribution. For long
   records it is important to allow more flexibility. Quantile regression
   methods are available to estimate monotone trends for single stations.
   Having multiple stations in a region, the significance of the trend at
   the regional scale is often of interest. From this perspective the
   authors propose a regression approach that can be used to estimate a
   common monotone trend for the site-specific quantiles. Moreover, the
   method allows for the construction of confidence bands and testing the
   hypothesis of an existing nondecreasing trend against the null
   hypothesis of no trend. The approach is applied to 102 series of daily
   rainfall over the Netherlands for the period 1910-2009. The results are
   compared with those from a (regional) Mann-Kendall test. Significantly
   increasing trends are found for the winter season and for the whole
   year. In the summer season trends are less consistent over the region
   and are only significant in the western part of the Netherlands. For the
   summer season, linearity of the trend seems less apparent than for
   winter and for the whole year. However, the deviation from linearity is
   not significant.},

Abstract = {In Laos, the extent of rural groundwater use is largely unknown. This
   paper presents results of a study conducted in Champasak province,
   Southern Laos, to examine rural household attitudes to groundwater use
   and management; and to gauge farmer perceptions of the
   opportunities/constraints of increased groundwater use for smallholder
   agriculture. Significant differences in groundwater use, total cash
   income and perceived groundwater quality were found. Further
   agricultural expansion was constrained by insufficient labour and the
   limited area of individual landholdings, not by the limited groundwater
   supply, which was the preferred source to fulfil increased demands for
   domestic/agricultural use. There were no groundwater regulations.},

Title = {A conceptual model for assessing rainfall and vegetation trends in

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {Policymakers, governments and aid agencies require operational
   environmental monitoring in support of evidence-based policy-making and
   resource deployment in crisis situations. For Africa, this is only
   feasible at sub-continental scale with a large network of automated
   meteorological stations, a large number of highly coordinated field
   observers or with satellite remote sensing. The challenge with satellite
   data lies in the derivation of meaningful environmental indicators. This
   article describes a conceptual framework for understanding
   satellite-derived indicators of rainfall and vegetation greenness trends
   over Africa. It attributes observed vegetation changes to climatic (i.e.
   rainfall linked) and non-climatic drivers. A decade of annual rainfall
   and vegetation data over sub-Saharan Africa was analysed using
   satellite-based rainfall estimates {[}Famine Early Warning System
   Rainfall Estimation 2.0 (FEWSNET RFE 2.0)] from National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Climate Prediction Centre and the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from the
   Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) sensor.
   Rainfall and vegetation greenness trends were analysed for 759
   administrative regions of sub-Saharan Africa to identify those regions
   that have experienced a negative, positive or stable rainfall/vegetation
   trend over the period 2001-2010. The character of the relationship
   between the annual rainfall and max NDVI trends were examined to
   identify areas where the changes in greenness could be attributed to
   climatic (rainfall) and non-climatic (human land use or ecological
   disturbance) changes. Regions where increasing rainfall was associated
   with vegetation greening were found in West Africa, Central African
   Republic, West Cameroon and northeastern part of South Africa, whereas
   areas with evidence of climatic vegetation degradation' were located in
   Southern Madagascar, Nigeria, Kenya and the Garden Route region of South
   Africa.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated rainfall erosivity and its changes in China's
   dryland region during 1961-2012, using a daily rainfall erosivity model,
   ArcGIS based spatial interpolation tools, and the Mann-Kendall and Sen's
   methods. It was found that mean rainfall erosivity was 2-4098 MJ mm
   ha(-1) h(-1) a(-1) in the region, with the regional average of 794 MJ mm
   ha(-1) h(-1) a(-1), showing a significant increase trend accordingly
   with an increase in rainfall from northwest to southeast. Rainfall
   erosivity varied annually with the CV of 32.4-491.3\%, and varied
   seasonally with about three-quarter distributed in summer. During
   1961-2012, a statistically significant increase/decrease trend in
   rainfall erosivity was detected only for 24/10 stations or about
   4.6/0.4\% of the region, and a nonsignificant increase/decrease trend
   was observed for 32/45 stations or 16.5/10.0\% of the region at the 50
   to 90\% confidence level. No statistically confidential trend was found
   for other 126 stations or 68.5\% of the region. At regional level, mean
   annual erosivity of the arid zone indicated an upward trend, while the
   sub-humid zone a downward, but the semi-arid zone generally had no
   evidential trend. Comparing the 26 year's averages during 1987-2012 and
   1961-1986, mean erosivity of the arid zone increased by 17.4\%, the
   sub-humid zone decreased by 6.1\%, and the semi-arid zone reduced
   slightly by 0.45\%. The results suggest that change in the rainfall
   characteristics during the past half century had no significant
   influence on water erosion in the majority of the region, but it could
   probably induce an increase of water erosion risk in parts of the drier
   west and a slight decrease in parts of the wetter east including the
   Loess Plateau. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We analyzed rain-on-snow (ROS) events in two reanalysis products. ROS
   events are a relatively rare phenomenon outside of a few regional maxima
   including western Eurasia, the higher elevations of western North
   America, the northeastern United States, and southeastern Canada. ROS
   events occur at the high latitudes, especially away from the continental
   interior, and no robust trends were found in the frequency of ROS
   events. We also explored the variability of ROS events with dominant
   large climate modes. The most robust relationship was found with the
   Arctic Oscillation or North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO). The most
   notable variability associated with the AO/NAO was a northeast/southwest
   dipole feature across western Eurasia. More ROS events were found for
   northeastern Europe for the positive phase of the AO/NAO due to the
   increased frequency of rainfall. However, more ROS events were found for
   Central Europe for the negative phase of the AO/NAO due to the increased
   frequency of snow cover.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of trends and causes of changes of
   selected hydroclimatic variables influencing the runoff regime in the
   upper Hron River basin (Slovakia). Different methods for identifying
   trends in data series are evaluated and include: simple mass curve
   analysis, linear regression, frequency analysis of flood events, use of
   the Indicators of Hydrological Alteration software, and the Mann-Kendall
   test. Analyses are performed for data from two periods (1931-2010 and
   1961-2010). The changes in runoff are significant, especially in terms
   of lower Q(Max) and 75 percentile values. This fact is also confirmed by
   the lower frequency and extremity of flood events. The 1980s are
   considered a turning point in the development of all hydroclimatic
   variables. The Mann-Kendall test shows a significant decrease in runoff
   in the winter period. The main causes of runoff decline are: the
   considerable increase in air temperature, the decrease in snow cover
   depth and changes in seasonal distribution of precipitation amounts.},

Abstract = {Observed trends in severe weather conditions based on public alert
   statements issued by Environment Canada are examined for Canada. Changes
   in extreme heat and extreme cold events represented by various humidex
   and wind chill indices are analyzed for 1953-2012 at 126 climatological
   stations. Changes in heavy rainfall events based on rainfall amounts
   provided by tipping bucket rainfall gauges are analyzed for 1960-2012 at
   285 stations. The results show that extreme heat events, defined as days
   with at least one hourly humidex value above 30, have increased
   significantly at more than 36\% of the stations, most of which are
   located south of 55 degrees N; days with nighttime hourly humidex values
   remaining above 20 have increased significantly at more than 52\% of the
   stations, most of which are located south of 50 degrees N. Extreme cold
   events represented by days with at least one hourly wind chill value
   below -30 have decreased significantly at more than 76\% of the stations
   across the country. No consistent changes were found in heavy rainfall
   events. Because city residents are very vulnerable to severe weather
   events, detailed results on changes in extreme heat, extreme cold, and
   heavy rainfall events are also provided for ten urban centres.},

Title = {Evolutionary trends of the Niger Delta shoreline during the last 100
   years: Responses to rainfall and river discharge},
Journal = {MARINE GEOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {367},
Pages = {202-211},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {There is growing evidence that the world river deltas are influenced by
   climate change and anthropogenic activities. In this study, shoreline
   changes along the Niger Delta coast of the Gulf of Guinea, North
   Atlantic Ocean in the last ten decades were investigated. The
   relationships between these changes and hydrometeorologic variables of
   rainfall and river discharge were considered. Topographic maps and
   satellite imagery, in addition to rainfall and hydrological data from
   the lower Niger River basin, were used for the study.
   The results show two distinct shoreline dynamics patterns/phases: first,
   mobility with high net retreat between 1923 and 1987 interval and;
   second, mobility with low net progradation from 1987 to 2013. During the
   first phase, shoreline retreat is mainly concentrated on the western and
   arcuate sections of the delta. In the second phase, all sections of the
   Niger Delta coast prograded seaward.
   Strong correlations between: shoreline change and the river discharge
   (R-2 = 0.95), shoreline change and rainfall variability (R-2 = 0.8), and
   rainfall variability and river discharge (R-2 = 0.63) further confirm
   that shoreline changes of the delta during the last 100 years have been
   influenced by the variations in river discharge and rainfall, which are
   ultimately driven by climate change. It is therefore concluded that
   shoreline changes during the last 100 years along the Niger Delta coast
   have been influenced by rainfall variability and the resultant river
   discharge variations, which are ultimately driven by the regional
   climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Extreme rainfall events are among the natural hazards with catastrophic
   impacts on human society. Trend analysis is important to understand the
   effects of climate change and variability on extreme rainfalls. In this
   study, extreme rainfall (i.e., annual maximums) trends were investigated
   in Victoria (Australia) using data from 23 stations for storm durations
   of 10 and 30 min, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. The Mann-Kendal and
   Spearman's Rho tests were employed for detection of temporal trends.
   Moreover, the spatial variability of extreme rainfall trends was
   investigated through interpolation of Theil-Sen's estimator over
   Victoria. In general, increasing extreme rainfall trends were detected
   for short storm durations (i.e., 10 and 30 min, and 1 and 3 h), whereas
   decreasing extreme rainfall trends were found for long storm durations
   (i.e., 6, 12, 24 and 48 h). Increasing trends for short storm durations
   were mostly statistically significant, while decreasing trends for long
   storm durations were statistically insignificant. Trend analysis with
   respect to the four regions (i.e., Western, Northern, Central and
   Gippsland) in Victoria showed that increasing trends were present in
   general in the Northern and east Central Region, whereas decreasing
   trends were detected in the Western and west Gippsland Regions.},

Abstract = {This study is intended to determine potential trends in annual rainfall
   series with the parametric Student's t test and the nonparametric
   Mann-Kendall, Spearman's rho, and Sneyers tests. The study includes a
   trend analysis of annual rainfall data from 47 rain gauges, mostly
   located at rural sites, in the Aegean region of Turkey. The chi-square
   and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests showed that the null hypothesis of
   normality for the majority of the data (45 out of 47 stations) is
   acceptable. Moreover, the serial independence assumption, based on the
   lag-1 sample autocorrelations, is rejected in 14 datasets. The
   parametric Student's t test detected significant downward trends at 15
   rain gauge stations; 14 of them were also confirmed by the three
   nonparametric tests and by the trend-free version of the Mann-Kendall
   test. The results of the Sneyers test revealed that the approximate
   start years of significant downward trends were in the early 1970s and,
   sometimes, in the early 1980s. Moreover, the testing found that the
   normalized slopes of linear downward trends were significantly dependent
   on the station's longitude, which meant that the farther the station was
   located from the coast, the smaller the decreasing trend in annual
   rainfall was. Additional studies carried out on the normalized regional
   data and on the 5-yr running means showed that a considerable portion of
   the detected downward trends were mainly due to interactions of the
   particular start and end times of a large number of stations with
   interdecadal fluctuations and the dry conditions over the Mediterranean
   region during the last 25-30 years.},

Abstract = {Impacts of the changing climatic regime on the trends of Indian summer
   monsoon rainfall (ISMR) are explored in this study for the Indian
   Himalayan region (IHR). The analysis is carried out for the period of
   1951-2007 using a daily high resolution gridded data from APHRODITE
   project. At first, the percent departures of decadal rainfall are
   estimated from the long-term June to September rainfall values for the
   western, central, and eastern Himalayan (WH, CH, and EH) regions. Next,
   changes in the frequency of strong and weak phases of monsoon
   intra-seasonal oscillation are investigated. A non-parametric
   statistical method (Sen's slope estimator) is applied to the seasonal
   (i) mean rainfall, (ii) maximum rainfall, and (iii) frequency of extreme
   rainfall events of WH, CH, and EH regions to identify changes in their
   decadal, multiple year normals (NY1; 1951-1980 and NY2; 1981-2007) and
   long-term (NY3; 1951-2007) trends. The inter annual to inter decadal
   variabilities of the frequency of extreme rainfall events are explored
   by analyzing statistically significant intrinsic mode functions of the
   empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. Results of our analyses have
   revealed existence of an alternative decadal oscillation of scanty and
   excessive summer monsoon rainfall trends for the WH, whereas excessive
   rainfall is observed in the last three decades (1980-2007) over the CH
   region. It is also observed that the frequencies of both monsoon strong
   and weak phases are decreasing for the entire Himalayan region. No
   significant trend is observed for the WH and CH regions for the normal
   periods NY1, NY2, and NY3 when seasonal average rainfall is considered.
   However, a significant (p value < 0.05) negative trend of -0.04 mm/day
   rain is observed for the EH region during NY1 period. Similarly, the
   seasonal maximum rainfall trends for all the normal periods are found to
   be negative of which trends of -0.12 and -0.43 mm/day during NY3 and NY1
   are observed for WH and EH regions, respectively (p value < 0.05). No
   significant enhancement in the extreme rainfall event frequencies is
   observed for the entire IHR during 1951-2007. However, a statistically
   insignificant positive trend in the extreme event frequencies is
   observed for the EH region. A dominant cycle of similar to 2.7 years of
   high frequency of extreme rainfall events is observed for all the
   regions whereas, a 12.2-, 15.3-, and 5.8-year cycles are observed for
   the WH, CH, and EH regions, respectively.},

Title = {Assessment of trends in point rainfall using Continuous Wavelet

Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The existence of trends in hydro-climatic variables such as rainfall is
   an indication of potential climate variability and climate change and
   the identification of such trends in rainfall is essential for the
   planning and design of sustainable water resources. This study focuses
   on identifying existing trends in annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall
   at thirteen stations in the Onkaparinga catchment in South Australia
   during the period 1960-2010. A relatively new trend detection approach,
   which combines a Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) with the Mann
   Kendall (MK) test, was applied in this study. The original rainfall time
   series was decomposed to different periodic components using a CWT and
   then the MK test was applied to detect the trends. One station showed a
   statistically significant (at the 5\% level) negative trend for annual
   rainfall. Winter rainfall exhibited significant positive trends at four
   stations. In the case of monthly rainfall, significant positive trends
   were observed in June (at seven stations), November (at one station) and
   December (at one station). The study showed that the periodic components
   might have significant trends even when there are no significant trends
   in the original data. The periodic component that dominates the trend in
   the original data varies from season to season. A sequential
   Mann-Kendall analysis was found useful for identifying the trend turning
   points. Most of the trends, whether positive or negative, started during
   the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. The technique developed in this study may
   also be applied for trend detection of other hydro-climatic variables in
   other catchments, particularly where temporal and spatial variabilities
   are high. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Frontal convection (FC) and diurnal convection (DC) are the two most
   frequently observed weather systems affecting the pre-summer (May and
   June, MJ) rainfall formation over Taiwan and Southeast China. Focusing
   on the time period of 1982-2012 MJ months, this study found that the
   occurrence frequency of FC has declined, but the occurrence frequency of
   DC has significantly increased over Taiwan and Southeast China.
   Diagnoses of the atmospheric thermodynamic conditions over the East
   Asian-Western North Pacific (EAWNP) region indicate that the area
   favourable for the FC formation (i.e. the area with a locally enhanced
   meridional temperature gradient) has shifted northward from 20(o)-30(o)N
   to north of 30(o)N during the recent three decades; this shift has led
   to a decline in FC numbers over Taiwan and Southeast China. Analyses
   also indicate that the recent increase in DC activities over Taiwan and
   Southeast China after 1982 occurred in association with an observed
   strengthening of the daytime land-sea thermal contrast coupled with an
   intensification of the afternoon sea-breeze over the EAWNP region and a
   locally enhanced moisture flux convergence over Taiwan and Southeast
   China. Possible causes for the observed changes in the atmospheric
   thermodynamic conditions over the EAWNP region are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Using 34 years of hourly observational data collected from 1976 to 2009,
   the frequency of hourly heavy-rain events during the warm season in
   eastern Japan was studied. A significant regional trend of heavy rain
   was not recognized over the area as a whole; however, stations with
   increasing trends in heavy rain were detected when daytime convergences
   towards the central mountains were strong. These stations were
   concentrated in a mesoscale region at the southern foot of the mountains
   in the northern Kanto district. In addition, the surface-specific
   humidity (q(sfc)) in the mountainous region nearby also displayed an
   increasing trend, which was correlated with the increasing frequency of
   hourly heavy-rain events. It is thought that the mechanism driving the
   recent increasing trend in heavy rain is an increase in q(sfc) in the
   mountainous region under the conditions that mesoscale convergence of
   surface winds developed.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is a complex phenomenon with high spatiotemporal variability.
   Identification of homogeneous rainfall zones to better analyse the
   rainfall intensity and extent is of vital significance for water
   resources management and mitigation of potential hazards from extreme
   events, i.e. droughts and floods. Appropriate zoning of homogeneous
   rainfall regions may give better understanding of rainfall patterns by
   resolving small scale variations. Although homogeneous rainfall zones
   have been established at country scale based on climatological mean
   behaviour, there has been little attempt to identify zones over broader
   scale with consistently homogeneous rainfall variability. This study
   employed K-means and Hierarchical clustering methods to establish
   homogeneous rainfall zones in the East Asia monsoon region (20 degrees
   N-50 degrees N, 103 degrees E-149 degrees E) using 30 years (1978-2007)
   monthly rainfall data at 0.5 degrees grid resolution. Various cluster
   validation indices were used to assess the optimal number of homogeneous
   rainfall zones. The comparison of K-means and Hierarchical clustering
   showed that although both methods were able to define the homogeneous
   rainfall zones well with spatial contiguity, the K-means clustering
   outperformed the Hierarchical clustering in identifying more distinct
   zones with diverse rainfall characteristics. Mann-Kendall and linear
   regression tests were used for seasonal and annual rainfall trend
   analysis in the homogeneous rainfall zones. The study revealed that the
   region experiences distinct rainfall regimes over different zones.
   Furthermore, significant increasing and decreasing trends were observed
   over different zones with strong seasonal variation that indicate the
   aggravated stress of climate induced disasters, i.e. droughts and floods
   over the East Asia monsoon region.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a global issue that has impact on every living being
   in the world. One of the most noticeable consequences of these global
   phenomena is the inevitable water cycle modification, with precipitation
   being a major component in these processes. Consequently, research into
   the occurrence and distribution of precipitation has increased over the
   past few decades. As Malaysia is located in the tropical area where
   there is no distinct four seasons, analysing rainfall has therefore
   become one of the common assessment tools for climate change. In this
   study, rainfall trends of Langat River Basin were examined on a monthly
   and seasonal basis (monsoon and non-monsoon) for the period of
   1970-2012. Only rainfall time series with duration more than 25 years
   and missing data less than 10\% have been considered for this study. The
   Holt's test has been employed to model the rainfall trends for the 10
   selected time series; while Kendall's Tau test and Spearman's Rho test
   were used to test, compare and support for the significance of the
   trends. For monthly rainfall trends analysis, it was found that March,
   July and November are among the months those have most of the stations
   with increasing rainfall trends; while May and September are the months
   with the highest number of stations showing decreasing rainfall trends.
   Specifically, station 2815001 shows the highest number of months with
   changing rainfall trends throughout the year; while station 44255 has
   the least number of months with changing rainfall trends. Based on the
   seasonal rainfall trend analysis, there are seven stations during the
   Northeast Monsoon that revealed upward trends and the result is found to
   be consistent with the monthly rainfall trend analysis.},

Abstract = {This research investigates spatial patterns of Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) and rainfall variability in South America and
   their relationships based on analyses of the Standardized Difference
   Vegetation Index (SDVI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
   for the period April 1998-March 2012. The time series of SPOT-Vegetation
   10-daily composite NDVI data at 1-km resolution was smoothed and
   subsequently synthesized to monthly images using the maximum value
   composite technique. Furthermore, 10-daily rainfall estimates at 0.25A
   degrees resolution, available from the European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts through MeteoConsult and the Monitoring Agricultural
   ResourceS unit, were combined to retrieve monthly composites. In order
   to assess spatial patterns and rates of change, linear least squares
   trend analyses were performed on the SDVI time series and the SPI time
   series, taking into account the accumulated rainfall over the respective
   best lag. Only trends with Pearson's correlation coefficients
   significantly different from zero (p < 0.05) were considered
   significant. The results indicated that vegetation degradation is
   coupled to a significant decrease in the amount of rainfall in the last
   14 years in 8 \% of South America's area. In contrast, in 18 \% of the
   subcontinental area, vegetation greenness has significantly increased
   over the last 14 years, coupled to an increase in rainfall. For 46 \% of
   the study area, significant degradation or greening processes could not
   be linked to changes in rainfall over time, indicating human impact or
   the influence of other climatic factors, such as temperature and net
   radiation.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to obtain a better understanding of
   the spatial and temporal variability and trends of rainfall and river
   flow in the Cobres River basin, southern Portugal, using statistical
   tools. The present study is focused on the analysis of the trends in
   annual precipitations and river flow at a regional scale over 40 years
   (1960-2000). Datasets of daily precipitation recorded in eight rainfall
   stations and three river flow stations were analyzed. The nonparametric
   Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods were used to determine whether there was
   a positive or negative trend in rainfall data with their statistical
   significance. A detailed statistical analysis applied to the river flow
   and rainfall time series of all gauges indicates that rainfall is highly
   temporally variable and there is a decrease in the annual rainfall
   amount for the period studied (1960-2000). Thus, there are signs of
   significant rainfall reduction in the basin, and in fact, some rain
   gauges show a small rainfall increase during the recent decades. The
   annual river flow variation has a cyclic behavior with a period length
   of approximately 10 years. The results seem integrated to the global and
   European continental scale findings: Decreasing trends are dominant for
   almost all indices; most of the calculated slopes are statistically
   insignificant; the distribution of positive and negative slopes in the
   area is extremely irregular; and the changes in basin are more
   significant compared to other studies.},

Abstract = {Monthly rainfall data from 1901 to 2011 for 45 stations of Madhya
   Pradesh were used to analyze the changed rainfall trend of the region.
   Spatial distribution and temporal variation of rainfall were observed in
   the seasonal and annual series. Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope were
   used in the study for the trend analysis. Standard normal homogeneity
   test and Mann-Whitney-Pettitt test were applied for detection of break
   point in the series. Change percentage was calculated for seasonal and
   annual series for 111 years. Trend analysis was then done by dividing
   the entire series into two divisions before and after the break point.
   The impact of extreme events of rainfall on the trend was evaluated on
   the whole and partial series (before and after the break point).
   Variation in the spatial distribution of annual and monsoon rainfall was
   observed, which showed decreasing trend. The probable break point in the
   series was 1978 and extreme negative event of rainfall became frequent
   in the years after the break point from 1979 to 2011. The annual
   decrease of -6.75 \% of rainfall is observed from 1901 to 2011.},

Abstract = {This study examines the climatological features of tropical cyclone (TC)
   rainfall in Hong Kong in association with different TC-related
   parameters, and investigates the changes in TC rainfall, non-TC
   rainfall, and total rainfall during the past few decades in Hong Kong.
   On average, rainfall induced by TCs can account for about 25\% of the
   total precipitation during summer and fall, and the contribution can be
   even greater in extreme cases. Composite analysis suggests that extreme
   TC rainfall is often related to TCs in closer proximity to Hong Kong,
   with higher intensity, and is associated with stronger convection and
   moisture convergence in the vicinity of Hong Kong. Evaluations of the
   observed trends of different rainfall indices suggest that the rainfall
   variability in Hong Kong is considerably affected by the TC rainfall,
   which has a decreasing trend in frequency and intensity in recent
   decades. Taking out the TC rainfall from the total rainfall reveals that
   there is an increasing trend in daily rainfall frequency and intensity
   for non-TC rainfall in Hong Kong. Moreover, time-dependent generalized
   extreme value analysis of non-TC rainfall also reveals an increase in
   the return values of the maximum daily rainfall in Hong Kong. Results of
   this study suggest that, in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture
   of the long-term rainfall variations in Hong Kong, the contributions of
   TC rainfall should definitely be taken into account in the analysis.},

Title = {Temporal and elevation trends in rainfall erosivity on a 149

Abstract = {Temporal changes in rainfall erosivity can be expected to occur with
   changing climate, and because rainfall amounts are known to be in part
   of a function of elevation, erosivity can be expected to he influenced
   by elevation as well. This is particularly true in mountainous regions
   such as are found over much of the western United States. The objective
   of this study was to identify temporal and elevation trends in rainfall
   erosivity on a 149 km(2) (58 miles(2)) watershed in a semi-arid region
   of southeastern Arizona. Data from 84 rain gages for the years 1960-2012
   at elevations ranging from 1231 to 1644 in (4038-5394 ft) were used in
   the analyses. The average annual erosivity over the watershed as a whole
   was 1104MJ mm ha rh I yr I (65 hundreds of foot ton inch acre(-1) h(-1)
   yr(-1)), and ranged from approximately 950 to 1225 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)
   yr(-1) (56-72 hundreds of foot ton inch acre(-1) h(-1)yr(-1) ), with a
   statistical trend showing greater erosivity at the higher elevations. No
   statistically significant temporal changes in annual or summer
   erosivities were found. This result stands in contrast to recent
   modeling studies of runoff and erosion in the area based on downscaled
   GCM information that project significant levels of erosivity changes
   over coining decades. These results are consistent with known orographic
   rainfall effects, but contrast with recent studies that presented
   projections of significant trends of increasing erosivity in the future
   based on downscaled GCM outputs for the area. The results illustrate the
   need for testing and developing improved techniques to evaluate future
   erosion scenarios for purposes of making targeted soil conservation
   decisions. Production and Hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Abstract = {In recent times, trend analysis and change point detection in
   hydroclimatic variables receiving significant attention due to climate
   change and its socioeconomic consequences. In this study, long-term
   trends of rainfall in four subdivisions of southern India namely Kerala,
   Tamil Nadu, North Interior (NI) Karnataka and Telangana regions are
   analysed using linear regression, nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test
   and Sen's slope estimator methods. Trend analysis of annual rainfall
   time series shows an increasing trend in three subdivisions - Tamil
   Nadu, NI Karnataka and Telangana, and a decreasing trend in Kerala
   subdivision. Further the sequential change in trend of annual and
   seasonal rainfalls in the four subdivisions is conducted using
   sequential MK (SQMK) method. The SQMK analysis shows an early divergence
   of progressive and retrograde modes of post-monsoon rainfall of Kerala
   and winter rainfall of Telangana subdivisions. Further it is observed
   that among different seasonal rainfalls, the post-monsoon rainfall of
   Kerala subdivision shows a statistically significant increase in the
   recent past. Then the trend analysis based on discrete wavelet transform
   (DWT) in conjunction with SQMK method is performed on the post-monsoon
   rainfall time series of Kerala subdivision, and the results show that
   there is a dominancy of short-term periodicity of less than a decade in
   the subdivision.},

Abstract = {Climate variability and climate change have become key issues for the
   research community. In particular, precipitation plays a crucial role in
   the process because its variations in seasonal and monthly values,
   coupled with changes in extreme events, can impact on water resources,
   on natural environments and human activities, as well as on human health
   and safety. In this paper, an investigation of the precipitation
   variability in New Zealand has been carried out by means of a daily
   precipitation dataset of 294 rain gages with more than 50 years of
   observation. First, a statistical analysis was performed through the
   Mann-Kendall non-parametric test to detect possible trends at seasonal
   and monthly scale. Then, the daily rainfall series were studied by
   classifying the events into six different rainfall categories and by
   analyzing the presence of any significant trend through the
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. Results did not show a marked trend;
   however, a positive trend in winter and in spring and a negative trend
   in summer and autumn have been detected. The spatial analysis of the
   trend in the South Island for several time aggregations showed a
   negative trend in the eastern side and a positive trend in the
   southwestern side. Moreover, the trend analysis of the different
   rainfall categories showed a decreasing trend of the middle categories
   and an increasing trend of the weaker category.},

   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series is defined as
   the fraction of the difference between the observed NDVI and the NDVI
   predicted from climate data. It has been widely used to study
   desertification and other forms of land degradation in drylands. The
   method works on the assumption that a negative trend of vegetation
   photosynthetic capacity is an indication of land degradation if it is
   independent from climate variability. In the past, many scientists
   depended on rainfall data as the major climatic factor controlling
   vegetation productivity in drylands when applying the RESTREND method.
   However, the water that is directly available to vegetation is stored as
   soil moisture, which is a function of cumulative rainfall, surface
   runoff, infiltration and evapotranspiration. In this study, the new NDVI
   third generation (NDVI3g), which was generated by the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center Global
   Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (NASA-GSFC GIMMS) group, was used
   as a satellite-derived proxy of vegetation productivity, together with
   the soil moisture index product from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC)
   and rainfall data from the Climate Research Unit (CRU). The results show
   that the soil moisture/NDVI pixel-wise residual trend indicates land
   degraded areas more clearly than rainfall/NDVI. The spatial and temporal
   trends of the RESTREND in the region follow the patterns of drought
   episodes, reaffirming the difficulties in separating the impacts of
   drought and land degradation on vegetation photosynthetic capacity.
   Therefore, future studies of land degradation and desertification in
   drylands should go beyond using rainfall as a sole predictor of
   vegetation condition, and include soil moisture index datasets in the
   analysis.},

Abstract = {The minute study of the magnitude of changeability and the trend of the
   rainfall erosivity index has not been taken carried out yet in Iran. The
   present research therefore aimed to analyze the trends of the rainfall
   erosivity index as an initial step in the study of the consequences of
   climatic change on soil environments. The trend analyses were done at
   three time scales, viz., monthly, seasonal and annual, by the
   Mann-Kendall (M-K) nonparametric statistical test. The study was
   conducted for 18 synoptic stations distributed throughout Iran with a
   23-year (1970-1992) common data period. The results of the application
   of the M-K test considering the weighted area on a monthly basis showed
   that all months except August and December had decreasing trends in the
   rainfall erosivity index for the study period, while only June (p value
   = 0.06) and November (p value = 0.01) had a significant decreasing trend
   in the rainfall erosivity index at a confidence level beyond 94 \%.
   According to the results, there was also a small general decreasing
   trend in the seasonal rainfall erosivity index in all time series, but
   not all were statistically significant. The result of the M-K test
   ultimately verified a significant trend in the annual rainfall erosivity
   index for the entire country with respective p, Kendall's statistic and
   Kendall's tau values of 0.042, -73 and -0.316.},

Abstract = {Drought is one of the major natural disasters in the Loess Plateau of
   China. We aimed to reveal drought occurrence regularity, relations
   between different magnitudes of drought and precipitation intensity
   changes. Based on Chinese climate divisions and digital elevation model
   graphs of the Loess Plateau region, our study area was divided into five
   subregions by means of cluster analysis of the region's meteorological
   stations using a self-organizing map neural network. Utilizing daily
   precipitation data from 72 stations for the 1961-2012 period, and using
   the number of consecutive days without precipitation as the drought
   level evaluation, the frequency and differing magnitudes of drought
   occurrences in each season were analyzed. In addition, the first
   precipitation intensity after a drought period was analyzed using a
   Pearson type III frequency curve. Precipitation frequency changes
   following drought occurrences with different magnitudes in each
   subregion were analyzed, and the relationship between rainfall intensity
   and different drought magnitudes was observed, as was the relationship
   between rainfall intensity and the number of drought occurrences. The
   results of our study indicate that, first, changes in drought levels in
   the region within and between years are not obvious, but that changes
   are significant between decades. Moreover, drought frequency in
   subregions I, IV and V of our study was higher than in areas II and III.
   Second, as the drought level increased, the probability of heavy
   rainstorms and extraordinary rainstorms in the Loess Plateau region
   became lower, and the frequency of spatial changes at different
   precipitation intensities varied. The frequency of different
   precipitation intensities in subregions I, II, IV and V initially showed
   a decreasing trend, but, with continued development of drought and when
   extraordinary drought occurred, moderate and heavy rain became an
   increasing trend, with the frequency of rainstorms and heavy rainstorms
   decreasing at first, then becoming the same. The probability of moderate
   and heavy rain in subregion III showed a decreasing trend; that of
   rainstorms, heavy rainstorms and extraordinary rainstorms initially
   decreased then became the same. Third, while the frequency of drought
   occurrences in the Loess Plateau region for the 1961-2012 period showed
   an increasing trend overall, the extent of the increase differed among
   the different subregions.},

Title = {Seasonal and annual rainfall trends in Himachal Pradesh during 1951-2005},

Abstract = {In this study, we have analysed seasonal and annual trends in rainfall
   and rainy days over Himachal Pradesh, an Indian state located in Western
   Himalayas. Based upon rainfall data of 37 stations for the period
   1951-2005, it is found that the contribution of monsoon rainfall for the
   lower southwest part of the state is in the range of 60 to 80\% of the
   annual total, while it is only around 35\% for the higher elevation
   stations in the northern parts of the state. State averaged rainfall is
   decreasing significantly at 95\% level for January (-0.61 mm/year), July
   (-1.83 mm/year), August (-49 mm/year) and October (-0.90 mm/year). On
   seasonal scale, rainfall and rainy days are showing significantly
   decreasing trends for monsoon (-3.68 mm/year and -0.09 days/year
   respectively) and post monsoon (-0.98 mm/year and -0.03 days/year
   respectively). Annual rainfall and rainy days are showing significantly
   decreasing trends by -4.58 mm/year and -0.13 days/year respectively.
   Spatial patterns of monsoon rainfall and rainy days indicate significant
   decrease in southern and eastern parts of Himachal Pradesh, particularly
   in the Shivaliks and the middle Himalayas. Stations showing significant
   increasing trends in summer rainfall and rainy days are spatially
   coherent in the Shivaliks and tl middle Himalaya. Seasonal rainfall is
   showing significantly increasing trend in winter (+1.47 mm/year) and
   summer (+1.77 nun/year) and significantly decreasing trend in monsoon
   (-3.71 mm/year) for Shimla, the capital of Himachal Pradesh. The daily
   heaviest rainfall is showing significantly decreasing trends in the
   southern parts of Himachal Pradesh (Hamirpur, Kotkhai, Nahan, Nurpur,
   Renuka (Rainka) and Pachhad. Stations showing significant increasing
   trends in annual daily heaviest rainfall are located in middle Himalayas
   {[}Chini (Kalpa) and Palampur].
   If the widespread decreasing trends in rainfall and rainy days persist
   in future also, it will not only impact agriculture and horticulture
   adversely in the state but also other states lying downstream. However,
   this analysis will contribute to the knowledge of rainfall variability
   and trends over Himachal Pradesh and help agricultural, horticultural
   and water resources planners in decision-making in this important
   Western Himalayan state.},

Abstract = {The Serra da Mantiqueira Environmental Protection Area (SMEPA) is one of

   the environmental and water resources relevance of the SMEPA is widely

   rainfall behavior over the SMEPA, by detecting monotonic trends of total
   annual and seasonal rainfalls. The study was performed by applying the
   Mann-Kendall test to 37 years series from 23 rainfall stations located
   within and around the SMEPA. No trends were detected in total annual and
   spring seasonal rainfall. Few stations (one during summer, two during
   autumn and two during winter) presented statistically significant
   trends, indicating that there is no regional trend over the SMEPA
   region. The isolated significant trends detected suggest the existence
   of sites with distinct rainfall behavior in the mesoscale.},

Pages = {259-285},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Hourly rainfall data between the years 1975 and 2010 across the
   Peninsular Malaysia were analyzed for trends in hourly extreme rainfall
   events. The analyses were conducted on rainfall occurrences during the
   northeast monsoon (November-February) known as NEM, the southwest
   monsoon (May-August) known as SWM, and the two inter-monsoon seasons,
   i.e., March-April (MA) and September-October (SO). Several extreme
   rainfall indices were calculated at the station level. The extreme
   rainfall events in Peninsular Malaysia showed an increasing trend
   between the years 1975 and 2010. The trend analysis was conducted using
   linear regression; no serial correlation was detected from the
   Durbin-Watson test. Ordinary kriging was used to determine the spatial
   patterns of trends in seasonal extremes. The total amount of rainfall
   received during NEM is higher compared to rainfall received during
   inter-monsoon seasons. However, intense rainfall is observed during the
   inter-monsoon season with higher hourly total amount of rainfall. The
   eastern part of peninsular was most affected by stratiform rains, while
   convective rain contributes more precipitation to areas in the western
   part of the peninsular. From the distribution of spatial pattern of
   trend, the extreme frequency index (Freq > 20) gives significant
   contribution to the positive extreme rainfall trend during the monsoon
   seasons. Meanwhile, both extreme frequency and extreme intensity (24-Hr
   Max, Freq > 95th, Tot > 95th, Tot > 99th, and Hr Max) indices give
   significant contribution to the positive extreme rainfall trend during
   the inter-monsoon seasons. Most of the significant extreme indices
   showed the positive sign of trends. However, a negative trend of extreme
   rainfall was found in the northwest coast due to the existence of
   Titiwangsa Range. The extreme intensity, extreme frequency, and extreme
   cumulative indices showed increasing trends during the NEM and MA while
   extreme intensity and extreme frequency had similar trends during the
   SWM and SO throughout Peninsular Malaysia. Overall, the hourly extreme
   rainfall events in Peninsular Malaysia showed an increasing trend
   between the year 1975 and 2010 with notable increasing trends in short
   temporal rainfall during inter-monsoon season. The result also proves
   that convective rain during this period contributes higher intensity
   rains which can only be captured using short duration rainfall series.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is the key hydroclimatic variable that plays a vital role in
   the development of regional water management policies. Assessment of
   observed rainfall behaviour and its spatial and temporal variations are
   therefore important for climate change adaptation measures. This study
   assessed trends and step changes in observed annual and seasonal
   rainfalls across the South Australian region. More than 100 years of
   high-quality rainfall data from 53 rainfall stations were analyzed using
   robust statistical techniques. The results are presented according to
   the eight South Australian natural resource management regions.
   Increasing annual rainfall trends were observed for the Arid Lands,
   Alinytjara Wilinara and Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges regions whereas
   decreasing trends were found for the Murray Darling Basin, Eyre
   Peninsula and South East regions. Both upward and downward trends were
   identified in the Northern and Yorke region. Seasonally, austral spring
   and summer rainfalls exhibited increasing trends in most of the regions
   whereas autumn and winter rainfalls showed decreasing trends. Most of
   the rainfall step changes were observed to happen in the 1960s and
   1970s. The study also includes a discussion on possible mechanisms of
   South Australian rainfall variability and changes that may have links to
   the observed trends and step changes.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the trends of extreme daily rainfall indices over
   the Indochina Peninsula from 1960 to 2007. The trends were obtained from
   high-resolution gridded daily rainfall data compiled by APHRODITE with
   coordinates of 4 degrees N-25 degrees N and 90E degrees-112 degrees E.
   The indices were selected from the list of climate change indices
   recommended by ETCCDI, which is a joint group of WMO CCl, CLIVAR and
   JCOMM. The indices are based on the number of heavy rainfall days (>= 10
   mm), number of very heavy rainfall days (>= 20 mm), number of extremely
   heavy rainfall days (>= 25 mm), consecutive dry days (<1 mm),
   consecutive wet days (>= 1 mm), daily maximum rainfall, five-day maximum
   rainfall, annual wet-day rainfall total, Simple Daily Intensity Index,
   very wet days, and extremely wet days. The indices were simulated by
   calculating different extreme characteristics according to wet and dry
   conditions, frequency, and intensity. Linear trends were calculated by
   using a least squares fit and significant or non-significant trends were
   identified using the Mann-Kendall test. The results of this study
   revealed contrasting trends in extreme rainfall in eastern and western
   Indochina Peninsula. The changes in extreme rainfall events in the east
   primarily indicate positive trends in the number of heavy rainfall days,
   very heavy rainfall days, extremely heavy rainfall days, consecutive wet
   days and annual wet-day rainfall total, with significant trends at
   times. These events correlated with the northeastern monsoon that
   influences the Indochina Peninsula from October to February annually.
   The results in the west primarily indicate negative trends in
   consecutive wet days, where significant trends were correlated with
   decreasing number of annual wet-day rainfall total, heavy rainfall days,
   very heavy rainfall days, and extremely heavy rainfall days. Daily
   maximum rainfall, five-day maximum rainfall, very wet days, and
   extremely wet days show random positive (negative) significant
   (non-significant) trends, while the simple daily intensity index shows
   positive trends that dominate the southern part of the Indochina
   Peninsula, with some grids show significant trends.},

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {335-347},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Rain and cloud water from a high-elevation site and an adjacent
   lower-level site in the northern Pennines of England were sampled and
   analysed between 1994 and 2008. The comparison of wet deposition and
   rainfall depth at the high and low-level sites has been used to estimate
   the additional deposition of pollutants arising from `seeder-feeder'
   enhancement by washout of the orographic cap cloud that forms over the
   high-level site. The derived `orographic scavenging ratio' for different
   ions is used to map the orographic enhancement of wet deposition across
   the U.K The ratio of ion concentrations in cloud and in rain at the
   high-level site is also important for estimating the input of pollutants
   through the direct capture of cloud water droplets at high elevation
   sites.
   Long-term trends in ion concentrations in cloud and rain showed
   significant downward trends in non-sea sulphate, and a weaker downward
   trend in nitrate, but no trend in other ions. There was also no trend in
   the orographic scavenging ratios, implying that the methods used to
   estimate orographic enhancement across the U.K. are robust over time.

Title = {Trends and oscillations in the Indian summer monsoon rainfall over the
   last two millennia},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Observations show that summer rainfall over large parts of South Asia
   has declined over the past five to six decades. It remains unclear,
   however, whether this trend is due to natural variability or increased
   anthropogenic aerosol loading over South Asia. Here we use stable oxygen
   isotopes in speleothems from northern India to reconstruct variations in
   Indian monsoon rainfall over the last two millennia. We find that within
   the long-term context of our record, the current drying trend is not
   outside the envelope of monsoon's oscillatory variability, albeit at the
   lower edge of this variance. Furthermore, the magnitude of multi-decadal
   oscillatory variability in monsoon rainfall inferred from our proxy
   record is comparable to model estimates of anthropogenic-forced trends
   of mean monsoon rainfall in the 21st century under various emission
   scenarios. Our results suggest that anthropogenic-forced changes in
   monsoon rainfall will remain difficult to detect against a backdrop of
   large natural variability.},

Abstract = {More intense rainfall may cause a range of negative impacts upon society
   and the environment. In this study we analysed trends in extreme ETCCDI
   (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) rainfall indices
   in Montenegro for the period between 1951 and 2010. Montenegro has been
   poorly studied in terms of rainfall extremes, yet it contains the
   wettest Mediterranean region known as Krivosije. Several indices of
   precipitation extremes were assessed including the number of dry days
   and rainfall totals in order to identify trends and possible changes. A
   spatial pattern relationship between extreme rainfall indices and the
   North Atlantic Oscillation has also been examined. The results generally
   suggest that the number of days with precipitation decreased while
   rainfall intensity increased, particularly in south-western parts of the
   country. A slight tendency towards intense rainfall events is suggested.
   The examined rainfall indices and North Atlantic Oscillation over
   Montenegro seemed to be directly linked to changes in one of the major
   large-scale circulation modes such as the NAO pattern that is
   particularly evident during the winter season.},

Title = {LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM TRENDS AND MAGNITUDES IN IRRIGATED AND RAINFED
   MAIZE AND SOYBEAN WATER PRODUCTIVITY: GRAIN YIELD AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
   FREQUENCY, CROP WATER USE EFFICIENCY, AND PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE},

Abstract = {Large-scale quantification and mapping of crop water use efficiency
   (CWUE), evapotranspiration water use efficiency (ETWUE), and crop yield
   production functions, especially on a long-term and large-scale basis,
   are important to effectively evaluate and manage freshwater resources in
   relation to agricultural production. The overall objectives of this
   study were to quantify and map the long-term (1986-2009) magnitudes,
   trends, and frequency distributions of CWUE and ETWUE on a county and
   statewide scale and develop yield production functions on a county,
   zonal, and statewide scale for irrigated and rainfed maize and soybean
   in Nebraska. From 1986 to 2009, total increases of 31\%, 37\%, 29\%, and
   33\% were observed for irrigated maize, rainfed maize, irrigated
   soybean, and rainfed soybean yields, respectively. During that period,
   grain yields increased annually by 166 kg ha(-1) for irrigated maize and
   by 84 kg ha(-1) for rainfed maize. The yield increases on an annual
   basis for irrigated and rainfed soybean were about 50 and 30 kg ha(-1),
   respectively. Irrigated and rainfed maize ETc peak frequency occurred at
   600 and 400 mm, respectively, and irrigated and rainfed soybean ETc
   peaks were at 500 and 400 mm, respectively. On average, irrigated maize
   ETc was 52\%, 46\%, 35\%, and 25\% greater than rainfed maize ETc in
   zone 1 (semi-arid), zone 2, zone 3, and zone 4 (sub-humid),
   respectively. For soybean, irrigated ETc was 41\%, 29\%, and 15\% higher
   than rainfed soybean ETc in zones 2, 3, and 4, respectively (soybean is
   not grown in zone 1, the driest zone in western Nebraska). Irrigated
   CWUE for maize for all counties (90 counties for a 24-year period) had a
   mean value of 1.74 kg m(-3) {[}standard deviation (SD) = 0.37 kg m(-3)]
   and ranged from 2.07 kg m(-3) in sub-humid zone 4 to 1.33 kg m(-3) in
   semi-arid zone 1. For soybean, the statewide average (78 counties for a
   24-year period) irrigated CWUE was 0.64 kg m(-3) (SD = 0.14 kg m(-3))
   and ranged from 0.81 to 0.54 kg m(-3). The ETWUE had a mean of 2.32 kg
   m(-3) (SD = 0.52 kg m(-3)) for maize and a mean of 1.01 kg m(-3) (SD =
   0.55 kg m(-3)) for soybean. On a statewide average basis, about 74\% and
   3\% of the variability in rainfed and irrigated maize yields,
   respectively, was explained by ETc alone. For rainfed soybean, ETc
   explained about 44\% of the variability in yield; however, no strong
   relationship was observed between irrigated soybean yield and ETc. Maize
   CWUE showed substantial increases (from 1986 to 2009) of 35\% and 36\%
   in zones 1 and 2, and lesser increases of 17\% and 15\% were observed in
   zones 3 and 4, indicating that zones with smaller yields could increase
   CWUE more effectively by proper irrigation, soil, and crop management.
   These wide variations in CWUE and ETWUE indicate that there is a
   significant potential to increase the efficiency of current Nebraska
   crop production systems. The CWUE and ETWUE maps and the zonal and
   statewide average yield production function data presented in this study
   can be useful for evaluating the differences in these variables across

Abstract = {This study analyses monthly climatic data (rainfall, wet days, rainfall
   intensity, and temperature) and the annual maximum of short-duration
   rainfall (from 1 h to 5 days) to characterise climate variations,
   focusing on rainfall, and their effects on trends in damaging
   hydrogeological events (DHEs), defined as the occurrence of one or more
   simultaneous landslides and/or floods causing extensive damage. The
   methodology used is correlation, cross-correlation, trend analyses, and
   monthly indices. The monthly indices of rainfall, wet days, rainfall
   intensity, temperature, and flood and landslide occurrence were
   introduced to simplify the analysis of parameters characterised by
   spatial and temporal variability. The approach was applied to a region
   of Southern Italy (Apulia). The data were collected from two databases:
   the damaging hydrogeological events database (1,186 landslides and
   floods since 1918) and the climate database (from 1877; short-duration
   rainfall from 1921). A statistically significant decreasing trend in
   rainfall intensity and an increasing trend in temperature, landslides,
   and DHEs were observed. A generalised decreasing trend in short-duration
   rainfall was also observed. The main exception involved a very small
   number of time series with annual maxima as long as 6 h, for which an
   increasing trend prevailed. The results concerning the trends of
   selected climate and short-duration rainfall characteristics did not
   justify the increasing trend in DHEs. Hypotheses justifying this
   increasing DHE trend are proposed. This article identifies the
   advantages of a simplified approach to reduce the intrinsic complexities
   of the spatial-temporal analysis of climate variability. This approach
   permits the simultaneous analysis of changes in flood and landslide
   occurrence.},

Abstract = {This work studies rainfall trends for 196 years (1813 to 2009) of
   Meenambakkam Station, an old observatory located in Chennai, which is
   the fourth largest Metropolis in India. Precipitation data have been
   studied on the basis of months, seasons and periods. Long-term trends in
   rainfall were determined by Mann-Kendall rank statistics and linear
   regression. There is a significant increase of long-term annual and
   monsoon rainfall and insignificant increase of winter and post monsoon
   rainfall. Post monsoon, the main rainy season of Chennai contributes
   59.8\% of the annual rainfall, while contribution decreases to 57.6\% in
   1951 to 2009 and a further decrease to 54.7\% in the last nine years.
   Summer rainfall shows decreasing trend. Further, this study tries to
   find for an explanation for precipitation trends by two global climate
   phenomena, IOD and PDO. Annual rainfall has significant positive
   correlation with PDO and insignificant negative correlation with IOD.
   Rainfall in post monsoon season has significant positive correlation
   with PDO. The negative PDO (-PDO) phases show a decrease in rainfall and
   positive phases shows excess rainfall. Teleconnections with other global
   indices have to be studied further and deeper.},

Abstract = {Daily precipitation data from 31 Senegalese stations spanning the period
   from 1950 to 2007 were used to examine the inter-annual variations of
   seven rainfall indices: the annual mean precipitation (MEAN); the annual
   standard deviation of daily precipitation (STD); the frequency of wet
   days (Prcp1); the maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD); the
   maximum 3-day rainfall total (R3D); the wet day precipitation intensity
   (SDII); and the 90th percentile of rain-day precipitation (Prec90p). The
   indices were spatially averaged over three agro-climatic regions in
   Senegal. Trends in the time series of the averaged indices were assessed
   using both visual examination and a modified version of the Mann-Kendall
   (MM-K) test. Initially negative significant trends in all seven indices
   suggest gradually drier conditions over the three agro-climatic regions
   between 1950 and 1980. In contrast, no significant trends, or even
   positive significant trends, were observed from the mid-1980s to 2007.
   The MM-K test was applied to all available data (1950-2007) and the
   period from 1971 to 2000. While several indices were found to have
   significant trends towards drier conditions for the 1950-2007 period,
   only PRCP1 showed a positive significant trend for the 1971-2000 period.
   The MM-K test did not detect a significant trend for the other indices.
   It was found that the rainfall deficit and therefore drought is no
   longer intensifying, and that the region may even become wetter.
   However, the period covered by the observations is still too short to
   resolve the question of whether there is now a trend towards wetter
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Time series data can be reconstructed in terms of signal and noise
   components through Singular Spectrum Analysis method (SSA). In SSA,
   window length selection is important in ensuring that the signal and
   noise components are clearly separated. In general, the window length
   should be large enough but not greater than half of the observed time
   series data. However, different observed behaviour of a dataset might
   influence the selection of window length. In this study, we demonstrate
   the effect of window length on torrential rainfall time series data at
   three different scales in extracting the trend signals in rainfall data.
   The window lengths are compared using the classical SSA and another
   variation of SSA called iterative O-SSA. We use the minimum value of
   w-correlation to identify the window length that best measure clear
   separability between components. We found that a window length to the
   number of observed data of 6 shows a trend that fits well to the
   original rainfall time series data.},

Abstract = {Worldwide climate is likely to become more variable or extreme with
   increases in intense precipitation. In Mediterranean areas, climate
   change will increase the risks of droughts, flash floods and soil
   erosion. Despite rainfall intensity being a key factor in erosive
   processes, in these areas information on extreme rainfall intensity and
   the associated erosivity, based on high-temporal resolution data, is
   either non homogeneous or scarce. These parameters thus need to be
   assessed in order to highlight suitable adaptation strategies. In this
   paper, an hourly rainfall intensity (RI) data series is analyzed
   together with the corresponding 1-min rainfall intensity maximum (RIm)
   of 23 rainfall gauges located in Tuscany, Italy, in an area highly
   vulnerable to erosion. The aim is to look for temporal trends
   (1989-2010) in extreme rainfall intensity and erosivity. Fixed effect
   logistic regression shows statistically significant temporal increases
   in the number of RI and RIm exceedances over the 95th percentile
   threshold. Winter is shown to be the season with the strongest
   increasing trend in coastal and inland rainfall gauge groups, followed
   by spring for the coastal group and autumn for the inland group. Linear
   regressions show that in the inland group there is a temporal increase
   in rainfall erosivity and on a seasonal basis, the highest increase is
   observed in autumn. By contrast, for the coastal group this increasing
   trend is only detectable for spring and winter. Such an increase in
   rainfall erosivity and its potential continuation could have a strong
   adverse effect on Mediterranean land conservation.},

Abstract = {It seems to be obvious that precipitation has a major impact on greening
   during the rainy season in semi-arid regions. First results(1) imply a
   strong dependence of NDVI on rainfall. Therefore it will be necessary to
   consider specific rainfall events besides the known ordinary annual
   cycle. Based on this fundamental idea, the paper will introduce the
   development of a rain adjusted vegetation index (RAVI). The index is
   based on the enhancement of the well-known normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI2) by means of TAMSAT rainfall data and includes a
   3-step procedure of determining RAVI. Within the first step both time
   series were analysed over a period of 29 years to find best cross
   correlation values between TAMSAT rainfall and NDVI signal itself. The
   results indicate the strongest correlation for a weighted mean rainfall
   for a period of three months before the corresponding NDVI value. Based
   on these results different mathematical models (linear, logarithmic,
   square root, etc.) are tested to find a functional relation between the
   NDVI value and the 3-months rainfall period before (0.8). Finally, the
   resulting NDVI-Rain-Model can be used to determine a spatially
   individual correction factor to transform every NDVI value into an
   appropriate rain adjusted vegetation index (RAVI).},

Abstract = {Climatic variations have been addressed with studies at global and local
   levels, and changes were found in precipitation that has happened at an
   early stage, or later, or with interruptions during its cycle. The
   objective of the research was to evaluate the Trends of Rainfall Rates
   (TPP) in rainfall monitoring stations in the southeastern region of the
   State of Nayarit, during the period of 1981-2009. Four weather stations
   were selected in the Southeast which had held at least 20 years of
   weather records. Missing data was calculated by the mass double curves
   method, an analysis of trends in terms of time series by using the
   statistical Minitab software, which provided graphics and variants that
   allowed to observe the behavior a regional TPP. It was observed that
   there was an increase in rainfall in the months of August, September and
   October. In contrast, there was a reduction of rainfall from January to
   May, however, the month of July remained the most rainy one. The TPP
   shows a trend in increased precipitation, especially in the months of
   August, September and October, which could be interpreted as a result of
   a climate change.},

Abstract = {Ongoing global warming raises the hypothesis of an intensification of
   the hydrological cycle, extreme rainfall events becoming more frequent.
   However, the strong time-space variability of extreme rainfall makes it
   difficult to detect meaningful trends in the regime of their occurrence
   for recent years. Using an integrated regional approach, it is shown
   that over the last 10 years, the Sahelian rainfall regime is
   characterized by a lasting deficit of the number of rainy days, while at
   the same time the extreme rainfall occurrence is on the rise. As a
   consequence, the proportion of annual rainfall associated with extreme
   rainfall has increased from 17\% in 1970-1990 to 19\% in 1991-2000 and
   to 21\% in 2001-2010. This tends to support the idea that a more extreme
   climate has been observed over 2001-2010: this climate is drier in the
   sense of a persisting deficit of rainfall occurrence compared to
   1950-1969, while at the same time there is an increased probability of
   extreme daily rainfall.},

Title = {Trends in Canadian Short-Duration Extreme Rainfall: Including an
   Intensity-Duration-Frequency Perspective},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {52},
Number = {5},
Pages = {398-417},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Short-duration (5 minutes to 24 hours) rainfall extremes are important
   for a number of purposes, including engineering infrastructure design,
   because they represent the different meteorological scales of extreme
   rainfall events. Both single location and regional analyses of the
   changes in short-duration extreme rainfall amounts across Canada, as
   observed by tipping bucket rain gauges from 1965 to 2005, are presented.
   The single station analysis shows a general lack of a detectable trend
   signal, at the 5\% significance level, because of the large variability
   and the relatively short period of record of the extreme short-duration
   rainfall amounts. The single station 30-minute to 24-hour durations show
   that, on average, 4\% of the total number of stations have statistically
   significant increasing amounts of rainfall, whereas 1.6\% of the cases
   have significantly decreasing amounts. However, regional spatial
   patterns are apparent in the single station trend results. Thus, for the
   same durations regional trends are presented by grouping the single
   station trend statistics across Canada. This regional trend analysis
   shows that at least two-thirds of the regions across Canada have
   increasing trends in extreme rainfall amounts, with up to 33\% being
   significant (depending on location and duration). Both the southwest and
   the east (Newfoundland) coastal regions generally show significant
   increasing regional trends for 1- and 2-hour extreme rainfall durations.
   For the shortest durations of 5-15 minutes, the general overall regional
   trends in the extreme amounts are more variable, with increasing and
   decreasing trends occurring with similar frequency; however, there is no
   evidence of statistically significant decreasing regional trends in
   extreme rainfall amounts. The decreasing regional trends for the 5- to
   15-minute duration amounts tend to be located in the St. Lawrence region
   of southern Quebec and in the Atlantic provinces. Additional analysis
   using criteria specified for traditional water management practice
   (e.g., Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF)) shows that fewer than 5.6\%
   and 3.4\% of the stations have significant increasing and decreasing
   trends, respectively, in extreme annual maximum single location
   observation amounts. This indicates that at most locations across Canada
   the traditional single station IDF assumption that historical extreme
   rainfall observations are stationary (in terms of the mean) over the
   period of record for an individual station is not violated. However, the
   trend information is still useful complementary information that can be
   considered for water management purposes, especially in terms of
   regional analysis. RESUME{[}Traduit par la redaction] Les extremes de
   chutes de pluie de courte duree (de 5 minutes a 24 heures) sont
   importants a de nombreux egards, notamment pour la conception des
   infrastructures de genie civil, parce qu'ils representent les
   differentes echelles meteorologiques des evenements de pluie extremes.
   Nous presentons l'analyse pour des endroits particuliers ainsi que
   l'analyse regionale des changements survenus dans les quantites des
   chutes de pluie extremes de courte duree au Canada, selon les
   observations faites par pluviometre a auget basculeur de 1965 a 2005.
   L'analyse pour des stations particulieres montre une absence generale de
   signal de tendance detectable, au seuil de signification de 5\%, a cause
   de la grande variabilite et de la periode de releves plutot courte des
   valeurs de chutes pluie extremes de courte duree.
   Les durees de 30 minutes a 24 heures des stations particulieres montrent
   qu'en moyenne 4\% du nombre total de stations connaissent des hausses
   statistiquement significatives des valeurs de chutes de pluie alors que
   dans 1,6\% des cas, les valeurs sont significativement plus faibles.
   Cependant, des configurations spatiales regionales sont visibles dans
   les resultats de tendances des stations particulieres. Donc, pour les
   memes durees, les tendances regionales sont presentees en regroupant les
   statistiques de tendances des stations particulieres a travers le
   Canada. Cette analyse des tendances regionales revele qu'au moins les
   deux tiers des regions du Canada connaissent des tendances a
   l'accroissement de leurs quantites de pluie extremes, dont jusqu'a 33\%
   sont significatives (tout dependant de l'endroit et de la duree
   consideres). Les regions cotieres du sud-ouest et de l'est (Terre-Neuve)
   montrent generalement des tendances regionales significatives
   croissantes pour les durees de chutes de pluie extremes d'une heure et
   de deux heures. Pour les durees plus courtes de 5 minutes et de 10
   minutes, les tendances regionales generales dans les quantites extremes
   sont, dans l'ensemble, plus variables, les tendances croissantes et
   decroissantes se produisant a des frequences semblables; toutefois, il
   n'y a pas d'indice de tendances regionales decroissantes statistiquement
   significative dans les quantites des chutes de pluie extremes. Les
   tendances regionales decroissantes des quantites pour les durees de 5 a
   15 minutes se retrouvent plus souvent dans la region du Saint-Laurent
   dans le sud du Quebec et dans les provinces atlantiques. D'autres
   analyses utilisant les criteres specifies pour les pratiques courantes
   de gestion de l'eau - p. ex. intensite-duree-frequence (IDF) - montrent
   que moins de 5,6\% et 3,4\% des stations connaissent des tendances
   croissantes et decroissantes statistiquement significatives,
   respectivement, dans les quantites maximales annuelles extremes
   observees aux stations particulieres. Cela indique qu'a la plupart des
   stations au Canada, l'hypothese traditionnelle sur l'IDF des stations
   particulieres selon laquelle les observations historiques de chutes de
   pluie extremes sont stationnaires (pour ce qui est de la moyenne) sur la
   periode des releves pour une station individuelle n'est pas violee.
   Cependant, les donnees sur les tendances sont toujours une information
   complementaire utile pouvant servir aux objectifs de la gestion de
   l'eau, surtout en ce qui concerne les analyses regionales.},

Title = {Rainfall driven changes in behavioural responses confound measuring
   trends in lion population size},
Journal = {WILDLIFE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Pages = {344-355},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Population size estimates must be comparable through time to interpret
   trends in threatened carnivore populations. Because prey distribution
   and dynamics drive carnivore distribution, and sampling methods often
   utilise behavioural responses to attractants, habitat variability among
   sampling occasions may confound such estimates. We explored whether a
   marked and unexpected reduction in lion Panthera leo population size
   estimates in Kruger National Park, was real or represented changes in
   behavioural responses to call-up stations given reduced rainfall between
   sampling periods. Rainfall drives savannah landscape heterogeneity,
   surface water and lion prey food availability. Hence landscape factors
   should more strongly influence lion behaviour during dryer conditions.
   We compared proportion of stations visited and mean numbers visiting
   stations, among three sampling years (2005, 2006 and 2008) belonging to
   the two sampling periods 2005/2006 and 2008. We then modelled the
   influence of landscape factors and spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta
   presence on visits and numbers. We distinguished behavioural from real
   changes by simulating pseudo-absences of cubs (these are observations of
   females which do have cubs but did not show up with them at calling
   stations) and comparing observed with predicted population estimates.
   Adult males responded similarly among sampling years. However, in 2008
   the driest year, adult females and those with cubs visited a lower
   proportion of stations, and landscape influences on these groups was
   stronger. A switch from rainfall explaining adult females with cubs
   visiting stations during wetter sampling years, to distance to rivers in
   2008 confirmed landscape driven changes in lion responses consistent
   with prey distribution in dry conditions. However, simulations indicated
   that while behavioural responses accounted for some population
   reduction, some was real. Reduced rainfall induced behavioural effects
   were difficult to unravel from real population size changes. We advocate
   caution when interpreting trends from lion population estimates reliant
   on behavioural responses subject to variability in landscape factors.
   Particularly, for estimators sensitive to behavioural changes in females
   with cubs - the demographic component most affected by variable
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The work presented here centers on the identification and calculation of
   indices representative of annual low-flow conditions and baseflow
   recession form, and the evaluation of trends in these indices with time
   for rain-dominated streams of the Pacific coastal mountain ranges. Two
   different baseflow recession analysis techniques are employed, which
   when combined are capable of modeling the varied dry-season flow
   conditions that exist over the broad range of catchments included in the
   study area. Results indicate that over the past 40-80 years widespread
   trends of increasing rates of baseflow recession and decreasing annual
   low-flow conditions exist throughout the region. Of streamgages
   analyzed, 44\% were identified as having a statistically significant
   trend in either low-flow conditions or recession form with time. While
   spring flow conditions show little change over the study period, trends
   of decreasing late-summer flow conditions and increasing rates of
   recession are particularly common. Northern California and Oregon are
   especially impacted locations, with upwards of 60\% of study gages
   exhibiting decreasing trends in late summer flow conditions. Detailed
   conceptual explanations for the connections between trends in recession
   form and indices of low-flow are also presented. (C) 2014 Published by

Journal = {POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {27-39},

Abstract = {Given freshwater is crucial to sustaining life and forecasted to decline
   in relative abundance under most climate change scenarios, there is
   concern changing precipitation patterns will be a cause of future
   interstate conflict. In theorizing the impact of climate change for
   interstate conflict, we distinguish between trends (long-term means)
   that may affect the baseline probability of conflict, and triggers
   (short-term deviations) that may affect the probability of conflict in
   the short run. We jointly model the effects of mean precipitation
   scarcity and variability (trends) and year-to-year changes in
   precipitation (triggers) on militarized interstate disputes between
   states. We find higher long-run variability in precipitation and lower
   mean levels of precipitation in dyads are associated with the outbreak
   of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs). Contra neo-Malthusian
   expectations, however, we find joint precipitation scarcity defined as
   both countries experiencing below mean rainfall in the same year has a
   conflict-dampening effect. These findings push the literature in a

Abstract = {Climate is a primary determinant of agricultural productivity. In turn,
   food and fibber production is essential for sustaining and enhancing
   human welfare. The trends of maximum atmospheric temperature, rainfall
   are analysed for meteorological data of Anand district in Central
   Gujarat India. Rainfall distribution over India is highly erratic and
   uncertain both in time and space. Heavy rainfall for short period, and
   some times continuous dry spell creates problems for crop growth.
   Therefore, it is necessary to study the rainfall analysis for developing
   farming system which may help to increase and stabilize agricultural
   production through better use of natural resources. Monthly rainfall
   over Anand showed increasing trend in August and September with
   decreasing trend in June and July. Such trend was more evident in since
   in 1971 onwards. It revealed that the monthly rainfall during July.
   decreasing trend while August and September is in increasing trend. Such
   phenomenon was more evident since 1971 onwards. The positive value of
   Mann-Kendall test statistic (0.459) indicated that rainfall during
   southwest monsoon season had an increasing trend tendency which was
   significant in 0.05 levels. The rainfall of August was highly variable
   and undependable followed by September. The occurrence of excess and
   deficient rainfall when compared to that of normal was seen in more or
   less equal numbers of years. The rainfall range and its variability was
   less during deficient rainfall years when compared to that of excess
   rainfall years. During June month, the rainfall series showing
   significant (0.05) level in sub periods 1961-1990 (-0.340). In July
   month the series is showing significant level in sub periods like
   1901-1930 (0.261), 1931-1960 (0.483) and 1961-1990 (0.261). In the
   August month the series is showing significant level in sub periods like
   1931-1960 (0.655) and 1991-2011 (0.853). In the month of September the
   rainfall series is showing the significant level in sub periods like
   1901-1930 (0.335), 1931-1960 (0.596) and 1991-2011(0.389).},

Abstract = {This paper examines a spatial pattern of annual, seasonal and monthly
   rainfall trends in Serbia. The study used data from 63 weather stations
   between the period of 1961-2009. The rainfall series was examined by
   applying the nonparametric method of the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's
   method to determine the significance and magnitude of the trends.
   Significant trends have not been detected for the whole country at an
   annual scale. Seasonal trends at the confidence level of 97.5 \%,
   however, indicate a slight decrease in winter (5 stations out of 63) and
   spring (7 stations out of 63) precipitation and an increase in autumn
   precipitation (10 stations out of 63). Results for monthly rainfall
   trends also generally showed a nonsignificant trend with the exception
   of a negative trend in May (6 stations out of 63) and positive trend for
   October (9 stations out of 63). Calculated global autocorrelation
   statistics (Moran's I) indicate a random spatial pattern of rainfall
   trends on annual, seasonal and monthly timescales with exceptions for
   March, June and November. Overall, results suggest that only weak,
   mostly nonsignificant trends are present in Serbia in the period
   1961-2009.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to model, based on the overall distribution of
   extreme values, the probability of occurrence of a particular level of
   annual maximum daily rainfall in three Brazilian regions (Midwest,
   Southeast and South) and study their behavior over the past 71 years.
   The parameters of the general distribution of extreme values were
   estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The Mann-Kendall test showed
   that there is a positive trend in the annual maximum daily rainfall data
   series. The non-stationarity was rejected by the augmented Dickey-Fuller
   test supporting the use of the density function of extreme value
   distribution to describe the values of the occurrence of annual maximum
   daily rainfall. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov/Lilliefors goodness-of-fit test
   showed the good fit of the studied variable to the probability
   distribution function. The Midwest region has a return period of more
   frequent annual maximum daily rainfall below 300 mm in comparison with
   other regions. There is a clear change in the behavior of this extreme
   event in the Southern region. According to the literature, in past
   decades annual maximum daily rainfall of 248 mm has been estimated for a
   return period of 100 years for the state of Santa Catarina-South region,
   while the results found with the current series, annual maximum daily
   rainfall of 250 mm was estimated for a return period of 10 years.
   Extreme annual maximum daily rainfalls for return periods smaller were
   also found in other regions. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {A study on the decreasing trend in tropical easterly jet stream (TEJ)
   and its impact on Indian summer monsoon rainfall},
Journal = {THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY},

Volume = {118},

Abstract = {Using the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis wind and temperature data (1948-2011) and
   India Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall data, a long-term trend
   in the tropical easterly jet stream and its effect on Indian summer
   monsoon rainfall has been explained in the present study. A decreasing
   trend in zonal wind speed at 100 mb (maximum decrease), 150 mb, and 200
   mb (minimum) is observed. The upper-level (100, 150, and 200 mb) zonal
   wind speed has been correlated with the surface air temperature anomaly
   index (ATAI) in the month of May, which is taken as the difference in
   temperature anomaly over land (22.5A degrees N-27.5A degrees N, 80A
   degrees E-90A degrees E) and Ocean (5A degrees S-0A degrees S, 75A
   degrees E-85A degrees E). Significant high correlation is observed
   between May ATAI and tropical easterly jet stream (TEJ) which suggests
   that the decreasing land-sea temperature contrast could be one major
   reason behind the decreasing trend in TEJ. The analysis of spatial
   distribution of rainfall over India shows a decreasing trend in rainfall
   over Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh, central Indian region, and
   western coast of India. Increasing trend in rainfall is observed over
   south peninsular and northeastern part of India. From the spatial
   correlation analysis of zonal wind with gridded rainfall, it is observed
   that the correlation of rainfall is found to be high with the TEJ speed
   over the regions where the decreasing trend in rainfall is observed.
   Similarly, from the analysis of spatial correlation between rainfall and
   May ATAI, positive spatial correlation is observed between May ATAI and
   summer monsoon rainfall over the regions such as south peninsular India
   where the rainfall trend is positive, and negative correlation is
   observed over the places such as Jammu and Kashmir where negative
   rainfall trend is observed. The decreased land-sea temperature contrast
   in the pre-monsoon month could be one major reason behind the decreased
   trend in TEJ as well as the observed spatial variation in the summer
   monsoon rainfall trend. Thus, the study explained the long-term trend in
   TEJ and its relation with May month temperature over the Indian Ocean
   and land region and its effect on the trend and spatial distribution of
   Indian summer monsoon rainfall.},

Abstract = {Variations and trends in the rain regime of Israel are analyzed for
   1975-2010, when persistent global warming has been observed. Negative
   trend is observed over the majority of Israel, statistically significant
   only in the super-arid region. The decrease is significant over the
   majority of Israel only in the spring, reflecting a shortening of the
   rainy season, > 3 days/decade. The dry spells are becoming longer,
   significantly in most of the stations. The factors affecting these
   variations, synoptic systems, large-scale oscillations and global
   temperature, were studied for extended period, 1953-2010. A simple
   multiple stepwise regression model applied for the inter-annual rainfall
   variations indicates that the occurrence of Cyprus lows is the dominant
   factor and the Mediterranean oscillation index, MOI2, is also a
   significant factor. In order to reduce the inter-annual noise and reveal
   inter-decadal variations, the time-series of the rainfall and its
   potential predictors were smoothed by 11-year window, showing an
   increase toward the 1990s, followed by a decrease, at a higher rate,
   onward. Correspondingly, the aridity lines propagated southward till the
   mid-1990s and then withdrew back, at a larger rate. The large-scale
   oscillations and the global temperature explain 83 \% of the variance on
   the inter-decadal time-scale, half of it explained by the global
   temperature alone. The findings of this study support the expected
   poleward expansion of the Hadley cell due to global warming.},

Abstract = {West-central Uganda, a biodiversity hotspot on the eastern edge of
   central equatorial Africa (CEA), is a region coping with balancing food
   security needs of a rapidly growing human population dependent on
   subsistence agriculture with the conservation of critically endangered
   species. Documenting and understanding rainfall trends is thus of
   critical importance in west-central Uganda, but sparse information
   exists on rainfall trends in CEA during the past several decades. The
   recently created African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) dataset
   has been shown to perform satisfactorily at identifying rainfall days
   and estimating seasonal rainfall totals in west-central Uganda.
   Therefore, we use ARC2 data to assess rainfall trends in west-central
   Uganda and other parts of equatorial Africa from 1983-2012. The core
   variables examined were three-month rainfall variables for west-central
   Uganda, and annual rainfall variables and seasonal rainfall totals for a
   transect that extended from northwestern Democratic Republic of the
   Congo to southern Somalia. Significant decreases in rainfall in
   west-central Uganda occurred for multiple three-month periods centered
   on boreal summer, and rainfall associated with the two growing seasons
   decreased by 20 \% from 1983-2012. The drying trend in west-central
   Uganda extended westward into the Congo rainforest. Rainfall in CEA was
   significantly correlated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
   (AMO) at the annual scale and during boreal summer and autumn. Two other
   possible causes of the decreasing rainfall in CEA besides North Atlantic
   Ocean sea-surface temperatures (e. g., AMO), are the warming of the
   Indian Ocean and increasing concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols over
   tropical Africa from biomass burning.},

   Rainfall Series of Standard Durations Recorded in Turkey},

Abstract = {Data of 14 standard duration annual maximum rainfall series with
   durations of 5 min to 24 h and lengths between 30 and 73 years up to
   2010 that were recorded in Turkey are used. Mann-Kendall and linear
   regression trend, von Neumann independence, Wald-Wolfowitz stationarity,
   and Mann-Whitney homogeneity tests are applied on 155 complete series
   with a 24-h duration and 23 complete series with 14 standard durations.
   Next, only the linear regression test is applied on 174 incomplete
   series of 14 standard durations. The results of these tests indicate
   that almost 90\% of all annual maximum rainfall series are trend free,
   independent, stationary, and homogeneous at a critical probability of
   5\%. Finally, the newly proposed Sen's 1: 1 trend line method is applied
   to some series and its results are observed to be in agreement with both
   the Mann-Kendall and linear regression tests. It is concluded that
   standard duration annual maximum rainfall series in Turkey can be
   generally treated as independent and identically distributed random
   variables, which allow conventional intensity-duration-frequency
   calculations to be performed by statistical frequency analysis. (C) 2014

Title = {Trends and extreme value analysis of rainfall pattern over homogeneous

Abstract = {Trends of pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon rainfall pattern were
   studied on decadal basis over different homogeneous monsoon regions in
   India for the period 1871-2008. It is attempted to understand the
   relation of monsoon rainfall with the global teleconnections of El Nio
   and La Nia, for which the correlation analysis has been carried out with
   Darwin pressure and Nio 3.4 sea surface temperature (Nio 3.4 SST). The
   correlation analysis inferred that the significant correlations were
   observed when monsoon rainfall is related to ENSO indices on decadal
   scale than on annual ones. The study also found that the north-west
   region is more affected by the moderate El Nio years compared to strong
   El Nio years. The regions Central North-East and North-East could not
   make any difference among weak, moderate and strong La Nia events. The
   authors also have carried out the extreme value analysis over different
   homogeneous monsoon regions of India as well as for whole India. The
   results show that the return values of rainfall are increasing with the
   return periods for the forthcoming 10, 20, 50 and 100 years. The
   heterogeneity in number of threshold years that were recorded for the
   extreme rainfall over north-east (humid climatic type) and north-west
   (arid climatic type) described the climate variability. The results of
   the present study may be useful for the policy makers in understanding
   the rainfall exceedance in different return periods for planning the
   risk management strategies.},

Title = {Rainfall and climate variability: long-term trends in the Metropolitan
   Area of Sao Paulo in the 20th century},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {We investigated spatial temporal variability and long-term). trends of
   rainfall over the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP). Due to a lack
   of continuous and consistent rainfall observations in the MASP, a
   database for the spatial analysis was created from a composite of 94
   stations, with daily rainfall data for 1973-1997, plus data from the
   University of Sao Paulo's Institute of Geophysics and Astronomy
   (IAG/USP) station for 1933-2011, as the base of the long-term
   variability analysis. It is shown that the seasonal and interannual
   rainfall variability result from underlying local influences and remote
   large-scale atmospheric dynamics. These effects appear to be more
   complex during the austral spring and fall seasons, and seem to
   determine the duration of the rainy period over the MASP. The
   intraseasonal (30-60 d) oscillation of rainfall does not exhibit any
   long-term modulation; interannual rainfall variability for 1975-1990
   appears modulated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) scale (2-8
   yr). Nonetheless, there exists statistical evidence that the rainfall
   climate over the MASP had an abrupt change at the end of the 1950s, but
   the global climatic change that occurred in the middle of the 1970s is
   not evident. The progressive increase in the frequency of rainy days and
   total daily rainfall throughout the period of analysis are prominent
   factors in the trend of annual and seasonal rainfall. Furthermore,
   rainfall variability over the MASP may be modulated by the Southern
   Annular Mode (SAM), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and ENSO at
   seasonal scales, altering the normal progression of the seasonal
   rainfall cycle, while at interannual scales, each one of these patterns
   drives the rainfall variability, mainly when each pattern reaches its
   extreme value.},

Volume = {176},

Abstract = {Long-term studies of plant-pollinator interactions are almost
   nonexistent in the scientific literature. The objective of the present
   study was to determine changes and trends in the pollinator assemblage
   of ulmo (Eucryphia cordifolia; Cunoniaceae), a canopy-emergent tree
   found in Chilean temperate rainforests. We assessed the temporal
   variability of the pollinator assemblage and identified possible
   modulators of the observed temporal shifts. We sampled insect visitors
   to the flowers of 16 individual trees of E. cordifolia during 10
   consecutive flowering seasons (2000-2009), recording a total of 137
   pollinator species with a mean number of species per year of 44. Only
   three pollinator species (2.2 \%) were recorded every year. Two bee
   species accounted for 50 \% of all insect visits to flowers. One bee
   species, Bombus dahlbomii (native), was dominant in one season, whereas
   Apis mellifera (exotic) dominated during the next season. These
   interannual shifts in population abundances presented first-order
   dynamics that were characterized by oscillations with a period of 2
   years. Changes in the abundances of the dominant pollinators, as well as
   differences in temperature and precipitation during insect emergence and
   flowering, led to a nested temporal structure of pollinator composition.
   Furthermore, the abundances of less common pollinators were sensitive to
   the abundance of the dominant bee species and to monthly maximum
   temperatures and the average precipitation during spring and summer.
   Based on our results and those from other studies, we predict a decline
   in the numbers of Bombus dahlbomii and nondominant native pollinators in
   response to new exotic arrivals.},

Abstract = {Radio systems are affected by rainfall, and the attenuation increases
   significantly with rain rate and frequency. Above about 10 GHz rainfall
   must generally be considered for estimating expected link availability
   with sufficient attenuation margin included. Rain rate is a key factor,
   and depending on climate, it will dictate the possible path length and
   other factors such as antenna size, for the planned performance of a
   system that operates at higher frequencies than about 10 GHz. This paper
   presents results from an analysis of Norwegian tipping bucket rain gauge
   data from 1967 to 2013. It is found that the rain rate currently used by
   the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunication
   Union recommendation for attenuation prediction, R-0.01-the rate
   exceeded for 0.01\% of an average year-has actually increased in all
   parts of the country from where long-term data exist. Moreover, the year
   to year variability is significant. The increase may well be seen as a
   consequence of climate change. Such a change may cause higher
   attenuation effects than expected when radio links are designed
   following ``normal{''} dimensioning procedures.},

Abstract = {A thorough understanding of past and present hydrologic responses to
   changes in precipitation patterns is crucial for predicting future
   conditions. The main objectives of this study were to determine temporal
   changes in rainfall-runoff relationship and to identify significant
   trends and abrupt shifts in rainfall and runoff time series. Ninety-year
   rainfall and runoff time series datasets from the Gasconade and Meramec
   watersheds in east-central Missouri were used to develop data screening
   procedure to assess changes in the rainfall and runoff temporal
   patterns. A statistically significant change in mean and variance was
   detected in 1980 in the rainfall and runoff time series within both
   watersheds. In addition, both the rainfall and runoff time series
   indicated the presence of nonstationary attributes such as statistically
   significant monotonic trends and/or change in mean and variance, which
   should be taken into consideration when using the time series to predict
   future scenarios. The annual peak runoff and the annual low flow in the
   Meramec watershed showed significant temporal changes compared to that
   in the Gasconade watershed. Water loss in both watersheds was found to
   be significantly increasing which is potentially due to the increase in
   groundwater pumping for water supply purposes.},

Abstract = {Regional change under agricultural expansion in the Chaco of Argentina
   is determined by interactions of rainfall change, infrastructure
   development, socio-economic actions and values, and the social
   perceptions of change. Our study focused on adaptation in the
   socio-environmental system which is the key to understanding
   opportunities, uncertainties and risk in the context of historical
   change. Change in land use from extensive grazing through mixed farming
   and on to industrial-scale soybean production was made possible by a
   trend of increasing rainfall that reduced the risk of crop failure from
   drought since the 1970s. Rainfall change coincided with a period in
   which the Chaco forest was suffering extensive degradation from
   long-term extractive use. The degradation aided agricultural expansion
   since the degraded state of the ecosystem justified public policies of
   deforestation. In parallel to these resource-based processes, public
   policy changed in the late 70s and 80s toward favoring privatization of
   state land and exclusion of small producers. This permitted the land
   concentration needed for industrial-scale production. Technological
   innovation in both water and land resource management reinforced the
   process of concentration because small producers rarely have the
   financial or educational capital to develop or implement emerging
   technologies. One of the results of the intensification and expansion of
   agriculture is that soil surface sealing, waterlogging and flood risk
   are now effective at a landscape scale. To address these risks, private
   enterprise and government efforts must now come together toward
   innovative policies in integrated landscape management.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {Gridded rainfall data of 0.5 x 0.5 resolution (CRU TS 321) was analysed
   to study long term spatial and temporal trends on annual and seasonal
   scales in Wainganga river basin located in Central India during
   1901-2012. After testing the presence of autocorrelation, Mann-Kendall
   (Modified Mann-Kendall) test was applied to non-auto correlated (auto
   correlated) series to detect the trends in rainfall data. Theil and
   Sen's slope estimator test was used for finding the magnitude of change
   over a time period. For detecting the most probable change year,
   Pettitt-Mann-Whitney test was applied. The Rainfall series was then
   divided into two partial duration series for finding changes in trends
   before and after the change year. Arc GIS was used to explore spatial
   patterns of the trends over the entire basin. Though most of the grid
   points shows a decreasing trend in annual rainfall, only seven grids has
   a significant decreasing trend during 1901-2012. On the basis of
   seasonal trend analysis, non-significant increasing trend is observed
   only in post monsoon season while seven grid points show significant
   decreasing trend in monsoon rainfall and non-significant in pre-monsoon
   and winter rainfall over the last 112 years. During the study period,
   overall a 8.45\% decrease in annual rainfall is estimated. The most
   probable year of change was found to be 1948 in annual and monsoonal
   rainfall. There is an increasing rainfall trend in the basin during the
   period 1901-1948, which is reversed during the period 1949-2012
   resulting in decreasing rainfall trend in the basin. Homogeneous trends
   in annual and seasonal rainfall over a grid points is exhibited in the
   basin by van Belle and Hughes' homogeneity trend test. (C) 2014 The

Title = {Farmers' strategies to perceived trends of rainfall and crop
   productivity in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {123-140},

Abstract = {Despite decades of international attention to find solutions for the
   annual food shortages in Ethiopia, the problem still persists. This
   study, carried out in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia, focuses
   on farmers' strategies to counter yield failures and food shortages. It
   reveals that farmers indeed perceive a decrease in crop productivity and
   food production over the last decades, and that they blame a decline in
   rainfall for this. As a consequence, farmers apply different strategies
   to cope with, and adapt to perceived rainfall shortages and related
   expected yield losses: i.e. they sell more livestock, they migrate
   elsewhere, they change their crops and agricultural practices, and they
   rely more heavily on food relief programs. However, an analysis of
   rainfall data in the CRV shows that rainfall characteristics (mainly
   annual rainfall total) have not changed over the last three decades.
   Moreover, according to analysis of official data, crop productivity per
   hectare in the CRV even shows a slight increase over the last decade.
   The interpretation of this result is not straightforward. The farmers'
   perception of a decline in crop productivity and rainfall may be related
   to (i) the increased demand to grow more crops to feed the rapidly
   growing population (hence, food availability per capita has declined),
   and (ii) the lower moisture availability for plant growth resulted from
   soil fertility decline and soil erosion. Nevertheless, additional
   empirical research is needed to figure out the root causes of food
   shortage and yield failure in the CRV of Ethiopia. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {The Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies bimonthly Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data of 8 x 8 km spatial resolution
   for the period of 1982-2006 were analyzed to detect the trends of crop
   phenology metrics (start of the growing season (SGS), seasonal NDVI
   amplitude (AMP), seasonally integrated NDVI (SiNDVI)) during kharif
   season (June to October) and their relationships with the amount of
   rainfall and the number of rainy days over Indian subcontinent.
   Direction and magnitude of trends were analyzed at pixel level using the
   Mann-Kendall test and further assessed at meteorological subdivision
   level using field significance test (alpha = 0.1). Significant
   pre-occurrence of the SGS was observed over northern (Punjab, Haryana)
   and central (Marathwada, Vidarbha and Madhya Maharashtra) parts, whereas
   delay was found over southern (Rayalaseema, Coastal Andhra Pradesh) and
   eastern (Bihar, Gangetic West Bengal and Sub-Himalayan West Bengal)
   parts of India. North, west, and central India showed significant
   increasing trends of SiNDVI, corroborating the kharif food grain
   production performance during the time frame. Significant temporal
   correlation (alpha = 0.1) between the rainfall/number of rainy days and
   crop phenology metrics was observed over the rainfed region of India.
   About 35-40 \% of the study area showed significant correlation between
   the SGS and the rainfall/number of rainy days during June to August.
   June month rainfall/number of rainy days was found to be the most
   sensitive to the SGS. The amount of rainfall and the number of rainy
   days during monsoon were found to have significant influence over the
   SiNDVI in 24-30 \% of the study area. The crop phenology metrics had
   significant correlation with the number of rainy days over the larger
   areas than that of the rainfall amount.},

Abstract = {The emerging need for extended climate prediction requires a
   consideration of the relative roles of climate change and low-frequency
   natural variability on decadal scale. Addressing this issue, this study
   has shown that the variability of the Indian monsoon rainfall (IMR)
   consists of three decadal scale oscillations and a nonlinear trend
   during 1901-2004. The space-time structures of the decadal oscillations
   are described. The IMR decadal oscillations are shown to be associated
   with Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Atlantic tripole
   oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs) of the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans are
   also resolved as nonlinear decadal oscillations. The SST AMO mode has
   high positive correlation with IMR while the SST tripole mode and SST
   PDO have negative correlation. The trend in IMR increases during the
   first half of the period and decreases during the second half. The IMR
   trend is modified when combined with the three decadal oscillations.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is very crucial for the economic development, disaster
   management, hydrological planning for the country. In the context of
   climate change, it is pertinent to ascertain whether the characteristic
   of Indian rainfall is also changing. Using daily rainfall data for the
   period of 1907-2012 analysis were carried out, to find out the change in
   rainfall and frequency of rainfall intensity. Results indicated that the
   annual rainfall is not dependable. Contribution of NEM to the total
   rainfall is 50.3 percent which was followed by SWM (26.3\%).
   Contribution of NEM during every 30 years of periods was constantly
   increasing and the increasing trend was statistically significant at
   95\% confidence level. Total number of rainy days (very light, light,
   moderate, rather heavy, heavy, very heavy rainy days) during the study
   period was 80.2 days, in which the frequency of very light rainy days
   (35.0 days) was highest followed by light (20.7 days) and moderate rainy
   days (20.8 days). Trend analysis was done for all categories of rainfall
   to find out the presence of increasing or decreasing trend. Total number
   of rainy days slightly gets decreasing in all the seasons except NEM
   where the rainy days are increasing but the changes were not
   statistically significant. The results showed that there is no change in
   long term of monthly, seasonal, annual rainfall and frequency of rainy
   days. Hence, it can be concluded that there is no climate change
   observed over Coimbatore.},

Abstract = {Rainfall records for 23 countries and territories in the western Pacific
   have been collated for the purpose of examining trends in total and
   extreme rainfall since 1951. For some countries this is the first time
   that their data have been included in this type of analysis and for
   others the number of stations examined is more than twice that available
   in the current literature. Station trends in annual total and extreme
   rainfall for 1961-2011 are spatially heterogeneous and largely not
   statistically significant. This differs with the results of earlier
   studies that show spatially coherent trends that tended to reverse in
   the vicinity of the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). We infer that
   the difference is due to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation switching
   to a negative phase from about 1999, largely reversing earlier rainfall
   changes. Trend analyses for 1981-2011 show wetter conditions in the West
   Pacific Monsoon (WPM) region and southwest of the mean SPCZ position. In
   the tropical North Pacific it has become wetter west of 160 degrees E
   with the Intertropical Convergence Zone/WPM expanding northwards west of
   140 degrees E. Northeast of the SPCZ and in the central tropical Pacific
   east of about 160 degrees E it has become drier. Our findings for the
   South Pacific subtropics are consistent with broader trends seen in
   parts of southern and eastern Australia towards reduced rainfall. The
   relationship between total and extreme rainfall and Pacific basin sea
   surface temperatures (SSTs) has been investigated with a focus on the
   influence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We substantiate a
   strong relationship between ENSO and total rainfall and establish
   similar relationships for the threshold extreme indices. The
   percentile-based and absolute extreme indices are influenced by ENSO to
   a lesser extent and in some cases the influence is marginal.
   Undoubtedly, larger-scale SST variability is not the only influence on
   these indices.},

Title = {Did Climate Change-Induced Rainfall Trends Contribute to the Australian
   Millennium Drought?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {27},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3145-3168},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Australian decade-long ``Millennium Drought{''} broke in the summer
   of 2010/11 and was considered the most severe drought since instrumental
   records began in the 1900s. A crucial question is whether climate change
   played a role in inducing the rainfall deficit. The climate modes in
   question include the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), affecting southern
   Australia in winter and spring; the southern annular mode (SAM) with an
   opposing influence on southern Australia in winter to that in spring;
   and El Nino-Southern Oscillation, affecting northern and eastern
   Australia in most seasons and southeastern Australia in spring through
   its coherence with the IOD. Furthermore, the poleward edge of the
   Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell, which indicates the position of the
   subtropical dry zone, has possible implications for recent rainfall
   declines in autumn. Using observations and simulations from phase 5 of
   the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), it is shown that the
   drought over southwest Western Australia is partly attributable to a
   long-term upward SAM trend, which contributed to half of the winter
   rainfall reduction in this region. For southeast Australia, models
   simulate weak trends in the pertinent climate modes. In particular, they
   severely underestimate the observed poleward expansion of the
   subtropical dry zone and associated impacts. Thus, although climate
   models generally suggest that Australia's Millennium Drought was mostly
   due to multidecadal variability, some late-twentieth-century changes in
   climate modes that influence regional rainfall are partially
   attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse warming.},

Volume = {88},

Abstract = {Kerala, a maritime state of India is bestowed with abundant rainfall
   which is about three times the national average. This study is conducted
   to have a better understanding of rainfall variability and trend at
   regional level for this state during the last 100 years. It is found
   that the rainfall variation in northern and southern regions of Kerala
   is large and the deviation is on different timescales. There is a
   shifting of rainfall mean and variability during the seasons. The trend
   analysis on rainfall data over the last 100 years reveals that there is
   a significant (99\%) decreasing trend in most of the regions of Kerala
   especially in the month of January, July and November. The annual and
   seasonal trends of rainfall in most regions of Kerala are also found to
   be decreasing significantly. This decreasing trend may be related to
   global anomalies as a result of anthropogenic green house gas (GHG)
   emissions due to increased fossil fuel use, land-use change due to
   urbanisation and deforestation, proliferation in transportation
   associated atmospheric pollutants. We have also conducted a study of the
   seasonality index (SI) and found that only one district in the northern
   region (Kasaragod) has seasonality index of more than 1 and that the
   distribution of monthly rainfall in this district is mostly attributed
   to 1 or 2 months. In rest of the districts, the rainfall is markedly
   seasonal. The trend in SI reveals that the rainfall distribution in
   these districts has become asymmetric with changes in rainfall
   distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates variability and trends in rainfall amount and
   extreme event indices in the Omo-Ghibe River Basin of Ethiopia based on
   observed records from six stations. Nine daily rainfall indices were
   defined and analyzed based on the World Meteorological Organization
   guideline. Sen's slope estimator and Mann-Kendall's trend test were used
   to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of the rainfall
   changes, respectively. The results show complex patterns of rainfall
   variability and local-scale trends. Statistically significant increasing
   changes were observed at Key Afer for most of the indices. On the other
   hand, the increasing trends in the number of very heavy rainfall events
   (R20 mm) were statistically significant at three (Jinka, Key Afer and
   Wolaita Sodo) out of the six stations. On the other hand, significant
   decreasing trends were found at Sawla for the maximum one day (Rx1 day)
   and the number of very heavy rainfall event (R20 mm). No systematic
   trends were found for the number of wet and dry day-related rainfall
   indices. However, the annual total rainfall averaged for the entire
   basin and at two stations (Key Afer and Wolaita Sodo) showed
   statistically significant increasing trends, both at the 0.01 level.
   Generally, the results of this study contradict with previous studies
   that reported significant declining trends in annual and Kiremt (main
   rainy season) rainfall amounts over this part of the country, suggesting
   the reviving of rainfall during the last two decades. Also, the results
   of this study agree with previous researches that reported the absence
   of systematic patterns of trends in daily rainfall indices in different
   parts of the country. The study has important implications for an
   effective management of water resources and climate risk management
   particularly in view of the fact that five hydropower plants and
   large-scale sugarcane plantations are planned, and some are under
   construction in the basin.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is a principal element of the hydrological cycle and its
   variability is important from both the scientific as well as
   socio-economic point of view. This study presents an analysis based on
   the precipitation variation in Assam, India over 102 years from 1901 to
   2002. Precipitation data from 21 stations have been collected. These
   data have been analyzed for both annual and seasonal variation. For
   trend analysis, Mann-Kendell and Sen's slope estimator test were used.
   To compare seasonal variations, three seasons of winter, summer and
   monsoon have been considered. Mean annual precipitation varied from
   2,074 mm (at Tinsukia) to 3,538 mm (at North Chahar Hills). The most
   probable year of change was 1959 in annual precipitation. Time series of
   the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) depict that near normal
   occurs in about 68 years out 102 years, and in 2.48 years out of 102
   years there was an extreme wet. All these findings can help provide
   rational regulatory and policy in relation to water resources to
   maintain the health of the various ecosystems that make up Assam, India.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1501-1510},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this article we examine trends in rainfall in the Fiji, using records
   from 14 stations in Fiji. These records cover more stations and
   significantly longer periods (>90years for several stations) than those
   used in any previous studies. We find that over a period of nearly
   100years there is high interannual variability but no significant
   long-term trend in annual rainfall in Fiji in either wet-side' or
   dry-side' stations. This result is consistent with the more restricted
   results of almost all previous studies. We also find no significant
   trends in wet season' and dry season' rainfall, considered separately.
   Thus unlike temperature data, rainfall data from Fiji provides little
   evidence of long-term climate change. There is an indication that the
   few dry seasons with rainfall more than one standard deviation below the
   mean have occurred more frequently in the most recent 50years than in
   the previous 50. Our results confirm that there is a significant
   influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on rainfall in Fiji,
   especially on the dry' side of the larger islands. However, we find that
   the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) does not modulate the
   correlation between rainfall in Fiji and the Southern Oscillation Index;
   contrary to the case in eastern Australia, this correlation is strongly
   positive for all phases of the IPO.},

Title = {Observed trends and variations in rainfall events over Ratnagiri

Journal = {MAUSAM},

Volume = {65},
Number = {2},
Pages = {171-178},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The observed trends. and variations in rainfall during southwest (SW)
   monsoon season (June to September) of individual station Ratnagiri, have
   been analyzed by using 30 years (1980-2009) daily rainfall data. The
   analysis revealed decreasing but not significant trend in total amount
   of rainfall and number of rainy days, with increasing but not
   significant trend in average intensity of rainfall during rainy days of
   monsoon season. To verify this increase in average intensity of monsoon
   rainfall over the region, the trends in frequency of occurrence of
   rainfall events and percentage (\%) contribution of rainfall events, to
   total monsoon rainfall in different categories of rainfall event, along
   with decadal variation during monsoon season are analyzed. The trend
   shows that frequency of occurrence of rainfall events and \%
   contribution of rainfall events to total monsoon rainfall in category of
   light, moderate, rather heavy and heavy rainfall events decreased (but
   not significantly), whereas frequency of occurrence of rainfall events
   and \% contribution of rainfall events to total monsoon rainfall in
   category of very heavy to exceptionally heavy rainfall events increased
   (but not significantly) during 30 years (1980-2009) over Ratnagiri
   indicating that increase in average intensity of monsoon rainfall is
   contributed by very heavy to exceptionally heavy rainfall events.
   Decadal analysis also shows that frequency of occurrence of rainfall
   events and \% contribution of rainfall events to total monsoon rainfall
   in category of light, moderate, rather heavy and heavy rainfall events
   have decreased per decade. Whereas in category of very heavy to
   exceptionally heavy rainfall events it has increased per decade. This
   increased frequency of very heavy to exceptionally heavy rainfall events
   over the region may lead to an increase in frequency of floods,
   landslides and spoil agricultural crops and hence requires attention.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Extreme rainfall events pose considerable threats to society and
   critical infrastructure yet, by definitions, these events are rare.
   Reliable estimates of the likelihood of such events are required to
   assist with impact quantification and risk management. Regional
   frequency analysis of pooled extreme rainfall to estimate the likely
   impacts of a changing climate is a well established method to assess the
   probability of these extremes. Previous analyses of country-wide changes
   to UK extreme daily rainfall have used the 9 Hadley UK Precipitation
   (HadUKP) regions (Alexander and Jones, 2000), which are not appropriate
   for use with extremes. While these characterize well the mean daily
   intensity and frequency within each region, extreme rainfall climatology
   differs from that of the mean characteristics. As a result the existing
   HadUKP regions do not represent extreme rainfall behaviour adequately,
   with regard to the frequency, intensity or timing of extreme events.
   Focussing on many extreme rainfall characteristics, such as the seasonal
   timing and magnitude of maxima, this article presents a formal
   representation of extreme regions which specifically describe extreme
   spatial and temporal characteristics. The article concludes with a brief
   exploration of improved event estimation using these extreme rainfall
   regions. The new regional definitions provide clearer upward trends in
   annual maxima over the period 1961-2010 than those estimated using the
   HadUKP regional pools. (c) 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Although animal population dynamics have often been correlated with
   fluctuations in precipitation, causal relationships have rarely been
   demonstrated in wild birds. We combined nest observations with a field
   experiment to investigate the direct effect of rainfall on survival of
   peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) nestlings in the Canadian Arctic. We
   then used historical data to evaluate if recent changes in the
   precipitation regime could explain the long-term decline of falcon
   annual productivity. Rainfall directly caused more than one-third of the
   recorded nestling mortalities. Juveniles were especially affected by
   heavy rainstorms (a parts per thousand yen8 mm/day). Nestlings sheltered
   from rainfall by a nest box had significantly higher survival rates. We
   found that the increase in the frequency of heavy rain over the last
   three decades is likely an important factor explaining the recent
   decline in falcon nestling survival rates, and hence the decrease in
   annual breeding productivity of the population. Our study is among the
   first experimental demonstrations of the direct link between rainfall
   and survival in wild birds, and clearly indicates that top arctic
   predators can be significantly impacted by changes in precipitation
   regime.},

Abstract = {Food security in India is tightly linked to rainfall variability. Trends
   in Indian rainfall records have been extensively studied but the subject
   remains complicated by the high spatiotemporal variability of rainfall
   arising from complex atmospheric dynamics. For various reasons past
   studies have often produced inconsistent results. This paper presents an
   analysis of recent trends in monthly and seasonal cumulative rainfall
   depth, number of rainy days and maximum daily rainfall, and in the
   monsoon occurrence (onset, peak and retreat). A modified version of the
   Mann-Kendall test, accounting for the scaling effect, was applied to 29
   variables derived from square-degree-resolution daily gridded rainfall
   (1951-2007). The mapping of gridded trend slopes and the regional
   average Kendall test were used concurrently to assess the field
   significance of regional trends in areas exhibiting spatial homogeneity
   in trend directions. The statistics we used account for temporal and
   spatial correlations, and thus reduce the risk of overestimating the
   significance of local and regional trends. Our results i/ improve
   available knowledge (e.g. 5 \%-field-significant delay of the monsoon
   onset in Northern India); ii/ provide a solid statistical basis to
   previous qualitative observations (e.g. 1 \%-field-significant
   increase/decrease in pre-monsoon rainfall depth in northeast/southwest
   India); and, iii/ when compared to recent studies, show that the field
   significance level of regional trends (e.g. in rainfall extremes) is
   test-dependent. General trend patterns were found to align well with the
   geography of anthropogenic atmospheric disturbances and their effect on
   rainfall, confirming the paramount role of global warming in recent
   rainfall changes.},

   (LPX-DGVM, one of several developments of the Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ)
   model) is evaluated in terms of its interception component and used to
   simulate trends in 20th century global relative throughfall from natural
   vegetation. Mean global annual runoff is estimated to have been reduced
   by 16319km(3)year(-1) between 1901 and 2006 as a result of biophysical
   changes controlling throughfall generation. Widespread decreases in
   relative throughfall of up to -1\% are evident between the periods
   1901-1953 and 1954-2006, while changes of up to -15\% are shown in parts
   of North America and East Asia. Areas of simulated decrease in relative
   throughfall often lie in close proximity to areas of increase,
   reflecting the effects of vegetation shifts. It is shown that simulated
   global absolute throughfall has generally increased (because of
   increasing precipitation) during the studied period, but the curtailing
   of runoff caused by decreased relative throughfall (as a result of
   increased fractional plant coverage and possible vegetation shifts) has
   caused a slight exacerbation of water stress in some regions (including
   parts of East Asia, North America and the tropics) and increased water
   supplies in others (for example, other parts of the tropics and northern
   Russia). This study offers an initial insight into an often overlooked
   product of climate-induced vegetation changes and attempts to quantify
   how these responses may contribute to influencing the global freshwater
   budget and global water resources. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Title = {Long-term trends and variability of rainfall extremes in the Philippines},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Owing to the increasing concerns about climate change due to the recent
   extreme rainfall events in the Philippines, long-term trends and
   variability in rainfall extremes in the country are investigated using
   60-year (1951-2010) daily rainfall data from 35 meteorological stations.
   Rainfall extremes are described using seven extreme precipitation
   indices (EPI) that characterize daily rainfall in terms of intensity,
   accumulation, and duration on a seasonal perspective. The nonparametric
   Mann-Kendall test is employed in combination with the moving blocks
   bootstrapping technique to detect significant trends in EPI. The results
   suggest a tendency toward a drying condition for the dry season,
   January-March (JFM), as indicated by statistically significant
   decreasing trends in seasonal wet days total rainfall (PCPTOT)
   associated with increasing trends in maximum length of dry spell (LDS).
   In contrast, statistically significant increasing trends in maximum
   5-day rainfall (RX5day) and decreasing trends in LDS denote a wetting
   condition during the July-September (JAS) season, particularly at
   stations located in the northwest and central Philippines. The trends
   obtained are further assessed by examining the longer time series of EPI
   at four meteorological stations (Aparri, Dagupan, Iloilo, and Masbate)
   that have rainfall data from 1911 to 2010. The longer historical data
   revealed that the trends obtained in the shorter period (1951-2010)
   could either be consistent with the continuous long-term trends, as
   observed in RX5day during JAS at Aparri and Masbate, or represent
   interdecadal variability as was observed at Dagupan and Iloilo. The
   long-term (1911-2010) southwestward extension of the western North
   Pacific subtropical high associated with a weakening of the 850-hPa
   westerly wind over the South China Sea partly provides a possible cause
   of the trends in EPI during JAS, whereas the weakening of the East Asian
   winter monsoon contributed somewhat to the trends obtained during JFM.
   Furthermore, interannual variations in EPI are found to be influenced
   greatly by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Composite analyses
   suggest that El Nino (La Nina) events are associated with statistically
   significant drier (wetter) conditions over the Philippines, especially
   during the seasons close to ENSO mature stage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The temporal distribution of the rainfall events within a crop growing
   season plays a crucial role on the crop yield. In this way, the main
   goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of climate trends in the
   10-day rainfall totalsobtained from five weather stations in the State
   of Sao Paulo, Brazil (1951-2012). The autocorrelation function, the Run
   test and the Durbin-Watson test indicateda lack of significant serial
   correlation in theseseries. The wavelet analysis revealed no conclusive
   evidence of periodicities in the temporal variability of this variable.
   According to the Mann-Kendall test, most of the 10-day rainfall amounts
   obtained from the five weather stations shows no significant trends.
   However, for the locations of States Campinas, Pindorama and Ribeirao
   Preto, the significant decreasing trends observed during the 2nd and 3rd
   ten days of October suggests a possible change in the climatic patterns
   of these locations, which may be linked to a delay in the return of the
   rainy season.},

Abstract = {The research related to trends and variability of climatic elements has
   acquired importance in discussions of environmental changes. In order to
   contribute to studies on the possibility of changes in rainfall in the
   State of Sao Paulo, this study aimed to provide new information on
   possible trends in rainfall. For that, rainfall data from 45 cities
   located throughout the state were used, with 30 years of climatological
   normals (1977-2006). For each station, the maximum daily precipitation
   (Pdma) was identified and adjustments were performed through the Gumbel
   probability distribution. Data were tested for adherence with
   Anderson-Darling test (alpha<0.05) and associated with the return times
   of 2, 5, 10 and 100 year. The historical series of Pdma (30 years) of
   each period were divided into 4 sub-periods of the same duration (15
   years), aiming to detect changes of Pdma. Three complementary
   statistical techniques were adapted to evaluate the possible
   non-stationary behavior of probable Pdma. Initially, two non-parametric
   tests were used: Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman: these were used to analyse
   the set of Pdma. The trend test of Mann-Kendall was used to evaluate the
   existence of monotonous trend in each station alone. Also,
   geostatistical techniques were used, in order to study the temporal and
   spatial variability of Pdma. From the 45 cities studied, 15 cities
   showed a positive trend of Pdma in at least one of the sub-periods, and
   in 5 of those cities. The tendency was seen in the total time series (30
   years), the city of Sao Paulo showed positive trends in the overall
   series and two sub-periods.},

Title = {Multi-decadal classification of synoptic weather types, observed trends
   and links to rainfall characteristics over Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Abstract = {An automated version of the Lamb weather type classification scheme was
   employed to characterize daily circulation conditions in Saudi Arabia
   from 1960 to 2005. Daily gridded fields of sea level pressure (SLP) from
   both the NCEP/NCAR and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis data (ERA40) were used as input data for
   this classification. The output catalog included 10 basic types, which
   describe the direction and vorticity of airflow in the region (i.e.,
   cyclonic, anti-cyclonic, and directional). In general, our findings
   indicate that cyclonic (C) days represent the most frequent type among
   all days, with 69.2\% of the annual count of days from 1960 to 2005,
   followed by SE directional flows (21 \%). It was also determined that
   airflows originating from the Indian Ocean (i.e., S, SE, and E) are more
   frequent than those from the Mediterranean and Red Seas (i.e., W, NW,
   and SW). The defined weather types were assessed for the presence of
   inter-annual and intra-annual trends using the Mann Kendall tau
   statistic. The trend analysis suggests statistically significant changes
   in the frequencies of a majority of the weather types from 1960 to 2005.
   The relationship between the daily occurrence of rainfall and the
   frequency of individual weather types was also described using daily
   rainfall data from a network of 87 weather observatories. Results
   demonstrate that increasing frequencies of weather types connected to
   easterly inflows support higher precipitation amounts over the study
   domain. Characterizing the association between atmospheric circulation
   patterns and rainfall in Saudi Arabia is important for understanding
   potential impacts related to climate variability and also for developing
   circulation-based downscaling methods.},

Title = {Seasonal trends of dry and bulk concentration of nitrogen compounds over

Volume = {11},

Pages = {3069-3081},
Abstract = {African tropical forests of the equatorial belt might receive
   significant input of extra nitrogen derived from biomass burning
   occurring in the north savanna belt and transported equatorward by
   northeastern winds. In order to test this hypothesis an experiment was
   set up in a tropical rain forest in the Ankasa Game Reserve and
   Nini-Suhien National Park (Ghana) aimed at quantifying magnitude and
   seasonal variability of concentrations of N compounds, present as gas
   and aerosol (dry nitrogen) or in the rainfall (bulk nitrogen), over the
   studied forest; and relating their seasonal variability to trends of
   local and regional winds and rainfall and to variations of fire events
   in the region. Three DELTA systems, implemented for monthly measurements
   of NO2, were mounted over a tower at 45 m height, 20 m above forest
   canopy to sample gas (NH3, NO2, HNO3, HCl, SO2) and aerosol (NH4+, NO3-,
   and several ions), together with three tanks for bulk rainfall
   collection (to analyze NH4+, NO3- and ion concentration). The tower was
   provided with a sonic anemometer to estimate local wind data. The
   experiment started in October 2011 and data up to October 2012 are
   presented. To interpret the observed seasonal trends of measured
   compounds, local and regional meteo data and regional satellite fire
   data were analyzed. The concentration of N compounds significantly
   increased from December to April, during the drier period, peaking from
   December to February when NE winds (the Harmattan) were moving dry air
   masses over the west-central African region, and the Intertropical
   Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was at its minimum latitude over the Equator.
   This period also coincided with fire peaks in the whole region. On the
   contrary, N concentration in gas, aerosol and rain decreased from May to
   October when prevalent winds arrived from the sea (southeast), during
   the monsoon period. Both ionic compositions of rain and analysis of
   local wind direction showed a significant and continuous presence of see
   breeze at site. The ionic composition of rainwater resulted much closer
   to seawater and poorer in N compounds from May to October.},

Title = {Analysis of time variation of rainfall in transnational basins in
   Iberia: abrupt changes or trends?},

Abstract = {An analysis of recent-past changes in rainfall records from the three
   major transnational basins in Iberia was performed, using data from
   Spain and Portugal which are generally considered separately. Change
   point (to detect abrupt changes in rainfall) and trend analysis were
   performed in the basins of rivers Douro, Tagus and Guadiana for the
   period 1961 to 2009. Nonparametric tests (Pettitt, cusum and
   Mann-Kendall) were used in order not to assume a specific distribution
   for the data. Field significance was taken into account when applying
   the tests for trends and change points. The importance of spatial
   correlation when calculating field significance was demonstrated. As
   well as finding changes in rainfall which have great significance for
   water resources, some important issues are raised as to the nature of
   changes in rainfall to be expected. Significant decreases in rainfall
   were found for the month of February and, to a lesser extent, March.
   Significant increases in rainfall were found for October in the Spanish
   side of Douro and Tagus catchments. The variability of the NAO index was
   considered a likely explanation for the changes detected. It was also
   demonstrated that changes in rainfall cannot be interpreted as trends or
   change points always because the pattern of change can be more complex
   than these two simplistic ways of describing change. Furthermore, the
   magnitude of the change can be completely different depending on the
   type of change assumed. Therefore the quantification of the change must
   be made with care, as the widely used linear trend can result in an
   overestimation of the change and, in principle, is not coherent with the
   multiple alternative hypotheses (different admissible monotonic
   patterns) implied by the Mann-Kendall test. Copyright (c) 2013 Royal

Abstract = {The Kinta River, draining an area of 2566 km(2), originates in the Korbu
   Mountain in Perak, Malaysia, and flows through heterogeneous, mixed land
   uses ranging from extensive forests to mining, rubber and oil palm
   plantations, and urban development. A land use change analysis of the
   Kinta River catchment was carried out together with assessment of the
   long-term trend in rainfall and sediment fluxes. The Mann-Kendall test
   was used to examine and assess the long-term trends in rainfall and its
   relationship with the sediment discharge trend. The land use analysis
   shows that forests, water bodies and mining land declined whilst built
   and agricultural land use increased significantly. This has influenced
   the sediment flux of the catchment. However, most of the rainfall
   stations and river gauging stations are experiencing an increasing
   trends, except at Kinta river at Tg. Rambutan. Sediment flux shows a net
   erosion for the period from 1961 to 1969. The total annual sediment
   discharge in the Kinta River catchment was low with an average rate of
   1,757 t/km(2)/year. From 1970 to 1985, the annual sediment yield rose to
   an average rate of 4062 t/km(2)/year. Afterwards, from 1986 to 1993, the
   total annual sediment discharge decreased to an average rate of 1,306
   t/km(2)/year and increased back during the period 1994 to 2000 to 2109
   t/km(2)/year. From 2001 to 2006 the average sediment flux rate declined
   to 865 t/km(2)/year. The decline was almost 80\% from the 1970s. High
   sediment flux in the early 1970s is partly associated with reduced tin
   mining activities in the area. This decreasing trend in sediment
   delivery leaving the Kinta River catchment is expected to continue
   dropping in the future.},

Abstract = {Intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall are expected to change in
   future due to anthropogenic climate change; however, this change may not
   be uniform across spatial and temporal scale. This paper examines the
   trends of sub-hourly, sub-daily and daily extreme rainfall events from
   38 rainfall stations located in southeast Australia. Two non-parametric
   tests (Mann-Kendall and Spearman Rho) were applied to detect trends at
   10, 5 and 1\% significance levels. The sub-hourly (6, 12, 18 and 30 min)
   and sub-daily (1, 2 and 6 h) annual maximum rainfall events generally
   showed an upward (positive) trend. However, the longer duration rainfall
   events (12-72 h) generally showed a downward (negative) trend. It was
   found that stations showing positive trends were characterized by higher
   elevations compared with the stations showing negative trends. This
   finding has important implications for urban stormwater management in
   the near future as most urban stormwater systems operate on a smaller
   catchment scale where sub-hourly and sub-daily rainfall events are used
   in their design.},

Abstract = {Climate variability is a threat to water resources on a global scale and
   in tropical regions in particular. Rainfall events and patterns are
   associated worldwide with natural disasters like mudslides and
   landslides, meteorological phenomena like hurricanes, risks/hazards
   including severe storms and flooding, and health effects like
   vector-borne and waterborne diseases. Therefore, in the context of
   global change, research on rainfall patterns and their variations
   presents a challenge to the scientific community. The main objective of
   this research was to analyze recent trends in precipitation in the San
   Juan metropolitan area in Puerto Rico and their relationship with
   regional and global climate variations. The statistical trend analysis
   of precipitation was performed with the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test.
   All stations showed positive trends of increasing annual rainfall
   between 1955 and 2009. The winter months of January and February had an
   increase in monthly rainfall, although winter is normally a dry season
   on the island. Regarding dry days, we found an annual decreasing trend,
   also specifically in winter. In terms of numbers of severe rainfall
   events described as more than 78 mm in 24 hours, 63 episodes have
   occurred in the San Juan area in the last decade, specifically in the
   2000-2009 time frame, with an average of 6 severe events per year. The
   majority of the episodes occurred in summer, more frequently in August
   and September. These results can be seen as a clear example of the
   complexity of spatial and temporal of rainfall distribution over a
   tropical city.},

Abstract = {A methodology has been applied to investigate the spatial variability
   and trends existent in a mid-twentieth century climatic time series (for
   the period 1943-1977) recorded by 58 climatic stations in the
   Albert-Victoria water management area in Uganda. Data were subjected to
   quality checks before further processing. In the present work, temporal
   trends were analyzed using Mann-Kendall and linear regression methods.
   Heterogeneity of monthly rainfall was investigated using the
   precipitation concentration index (PCI). Results revealed that 53 \% of
   stations have positive trends where 25 \% are statistically significant
   and 45 \% of stations have negative trends with 23 \% being
   statistically significant. Very strong trends at 99 \% significance
   level were revealed at 12 stations. Positive trends in January,
   February, and November at 40 stations were observed. The highest
   rainfall was recorded in April, while January, June, and July had the
   lowest rainfall. Spatial analysis results showed that stations close to
   Lake Victoria recorded high amounts of rainfall. Average annual
   coefficient of variability was 19 \%, signifying low variability.
   Rainfall distribution is bimodal with maximums experienced in
   March-April-May and September-October-November seasons of the year.
   Analysis also revealed that PCI values showed a moderate to seasonal
   rainfall distribution. Spectral analysis of the time components reveals
   the existence of a major period around 3, 6, and 10 years. The 6- and
   10-year period is a characteristic of September-October-November,
   March-April-May, and annual time series.},

Abstract = {As a rainbow trout producer, Italy is accounted as fifth in the world
   and second in continental Europe. In this study, the levels of the
   eighteen PCBs in feed and in trout, showed a statistical significant
   difference (p < 0.01) throughout the years, with a declining trend from
   2005 to 2010. This trend shows effectively that quality and safety of
   trout feeds has greatly improved during the last years and, as a
   consequence, also the PCBs values in muscle trout, showed a decreasing
   trend.
   Moreover, feed Sigma 18PCBs showed a statistical significant difference
   (p < 0.01) among the analysed brands and was positively correlated (p <
   0.01 and r = 0.451) with the rainbow trout muscle Sigma 18PCBs. These
   results showed that the presence of PCBs in trout muscle is directly
   linked to the chemical quality of aquaculture feed. The most commonly
   detected PCBs congeners were congeners PCB 153 and PCB 138 in all the
   three compared brands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The historical rainfall data of 110 years (1901-2010) of the two
   neighbouring basins of Brahmaputra and Barak of Assam, Northeast India
   were analyzed for monthly, seasonal and annual trends. The Mann-Kendall
   test and Sen's slope model were used to identify the trends and estimate
   the magnitude of change, respectively. The analysis revealed significant
   decreasing trend of rainfall during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in
   the Barak basin during 1901-2010. Annual as well as monsoon rainfall
   during the recent 30-year normal period decreased significantly in both
   the basins. The last decade (2001-10) was the leanest decade in both the
   basins. Recent rainfall fluctuations with larger amplitudes indicate
   greater degree of uncertainties of heavy floods or short spell drought
   events.},

Abstract = {This study is aimed at in finding the trend or nonlinearity that may
   exist in the rainfall pattern of the State of Tamil Nadu. Based on the
   observed rainfall data for a period of 111 years (19012011), a trend
   analysis with Hurst exponent and non-linearity analysis with Lyapunov
   exponent is employed. The interpretation of the Hurst exponent of Tamil
   Nadu rainfall indicates that the Southwest Monsoon rainfall shows a
   persistent behaviour, whereas the annual rainfall shows an
   anti-persistence behaviour. The Northeast Monsoon, which is the most
   important season for the State of Tamil Nadu shows a randomness or
   non-linearity in its value. The non-linearity in the Northeast Monsoon
   has been verified through Lyapunov Exponent. The Northeast Monsoon shows
   a largest positive Lyapunov exponent value than the Southwest and Annual
   rainfall. This indicates that the Northeast Monsoon of Tamil Nadu is
   chaotic. The chaotic nature of the Northeast Monsoon is also verified
   using surrogate data method.},

Abstract = {Growing season rain and cloud events were sampled between 1984-2010 at
   Lakes of the Clouds (LOC) (1,540 m above sea level (ASL)) which is 1.6
   km SW of the summit of Mount Washington, NH (1,914 m ASL). Mount
   Washington's summit is in the clouds ca. 51 \% of the time. All samples
   were measured for pH, while cations and anions were measured
   consistently from 1996 to 2010. Annual mean cloud and rain water
   hydrogen ion concentrations declined significantly from 1984-2010.
   Nighttime cloud and rain hydrogen, sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate ion
   concentrations were significantly greater compared to daytime. Ion mean
   concentrations declined over the 1996-2010 timeframe and more rapidly
   since 2005. Co-located filter-based aerosol measurement (PM2.5) at LOC
   had higher ratios of ammonium to sulfate in summer daytime samples post
   (1995-2010) full implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.
   This suggests a shift towards more neutralized sulfate aerosol
   dissolution into clouds with relatively more ammonium and declines in
   acidity. The origin of cloud water sampled, which ranges from regional
   fronts to orographic lower elevation air mass uplift, along with the
   diurnally shifting nocturnal boundary layer that often puts the LOC site
   in and out of the mixed layer, likely contributes to the diurnal and
   inter-annual variability observed.},

Abstract = {This work examines the contributions of different synoptic types to
   rainfall variability and trends in southeast Australia, with a focus on
   the drought of 1996-2009. Rainfall in the Mallee region is used to
   characterize the southeast region. The reduction in rainfall in the
   Mallee region during the drought is about two-thirds composed of a
   reduction in rainfall from cutoff lows and about one-third due to a
   reduction in rainfall from frontal systems. The reduction in frontal
   rain is mostly due to a reduction in rain per frontal system, which is
   associated with a reduction of baroclinicity in the southeast and south
   of Australia. The reduction of cutoff rainfall is mostly due to a
   reduction in number of the most intense cutoff systems. The frequency of
   cutoff systems matches changes in blocking activity in the Tasman Sea
   region. Blocking has undergone a weak decline in the Tasman region over
   the period of the drought. Analysis of synoptic system contributions to
   the drought indicates that causal explanations of the drought should
   account for variation in cutoff systems and blocking.},

Abstract = {Bangladesh has always been predominantly an agriculture based country.
   In early days, agricultural production was fully dependent on rainfall.
   Over the study period of recent 30 years, trend values of monsoon
   average rainfall in Chittagong, Dhaka and Rajshahi has risen as a
   consequence of the increase of the increase in rainfall. On the other
   hand, the trend value in Sylhet has declined with the decrease in
   rainfall. This paper has measured the correlation coefficients between
   rainfall and time for four stations: Chittagong, Dhaka, Rajshahi and
   Sylhet where correlation coefficient for Dhaka station and Sylhet
   station is maximum and negative respectively. This study indicates that
   climate change, global warming, destruction of hills etc. have
   disastrous effects on rainfall which is hampering not only the
   agricultural production but also the ecosystem. It is hoped that this
   research may be of help to the concerned organizations and experts
   working on this problem.},

Abstract = {This work assesses spatial and temporal changes in rainfall in southern

   according to the synoptic system generating the rainfall. Rainfall
   decreases over the period across much of the southwest, with the most
   significant decrease occurring around 2000. These changes are associated
   with frontal and cutoff systems. Frontal systems dominate the timing and
   changes of rainfall in western Tasmania. In the southeast, the timing
   and magnitude of rainfall changes are more closely associated with
   cutoff systems and show consistent decreases in the early 1990s. The
   largest reductions in rainfall in the southeast are in the Alpine region
   and are due to cutoffs and fronts and exhibit seasonal and spatial
   variations consistent with the climatologies of these systems.},

Abstract = {Extreme events are an important part of climate variability and their
   intensity and persistence are often modulated by large scale climatic
   patterns which might act as forcing drivers affecting their probability
   of occurrence. When the North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) and the Equatorial
   Pacific (Nino 3 region) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are of
   opposite signs and the first one is positive while the second one is
   negative, the rainfall response is stronger in the northern coast of
   Venezuela as well as in the Pacific coast of Central America during the
   Nov-Feb period. The difference between these two SST anomaly time series
   (NTA-Nino3) is used in this analysis and it is called the Atlantic
   -Pacific Index or API. By fitting a dynamic generalized extreme value
   (GEV) model to station based dailof rainfall extremes in the northern
   Venezuelan coast for the months Nov-Feb. Dependence between the
   Atlantic-Pacific index and the probabilistic behavior of extreme
   rainfall was also explored for simulations from two global coupled
   General Circulation Models for the 20th century climate (20C3M
   experiment) and the 21st century climate (SRES A2 experiment): the
   Echam5 model and the HadCM3 model. A significant dependence of extreme
   rainfall on the Atlantic -Pacific index is well described by the GEV
   dynamic model for the Echam5 20C3M experiment model outputs. When
   looking at future climates under the SRES A2 experiment, the dependence
   of extreme rainfall from the API index is still significant for the
   middle part of the 21st century (2046-2064), while this dependence fades
   off for the latest part of the century (2081-2099).y rainfall at
   different locations and to the Xie and Arkin dataset for the Vargas
   state, we found the API index to be an adequate index to explain the
   probabilistic nature},

Abstract = {In general Indian summer monsoon rainfall did not show any significant
   trend in all Indian summer monsoon rainfall series, however, it was
   reported that the ISMR is subjected to spatial trends. This paper made
   an attempt to bring out long term trends of different intensity classes
   of summer monsoon rainfall in different regions of Indian subcontinent.
   The long term trend of seasonal and monthly rainfall were also made
   using the India Meteorological Department gridded daily rainfall data
   with a spatial resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees latitude-longitude
   grid for the period from 1st January, 1901 to 31st December, 2003. The
   summer monsoon rainfall shows an increasing trend in southeast,
   northwest and northeast regions, whereas decreasing trend in the central
   and west coastal regions. In monthly scale, July rainfall shows
   decreasing trend over west coastal and central Indian regions and
   significant increasing trend over northeast region at 0.1\% significant
   level. During the month August, decreasing trend is observed in the west
   coastal stations at 10\% significant level. In most of the stations,
   mean daily rainfall shows an increasing trend for low and very high
   intense rainfall. For the moderate rainfall, the trend is different for
   different regions. In the central and southern regions the trend of
   moderate and moderately high classes show increasing trend. And for the
   high and very high intensity classes, the trend is decreasing
   significantly. In the northeastern regions, above 10 mm/day rainfall
   shows significantly increasing trend with 0.1\% significant level.},

   using Extreme Value Theory, reveals that post-1950 extreme rainfall
   characteristics (intensity, duration, and frequency) and their trends
   are significantly different from those of before 1950, with spatial
   nonuniformity. Majority of the locations in India have post-1950 trends
   of extremes with a different sign as compared to pre-1950. Further
   investigations with statistical change point analysis reveal that
   fraction of grid points having post-1975 changes is maximum. Majority of
   the urbanized areas have post-1975 change points, while the same is not
   true for nonurban areas. As urbanization has intensified during
   1971-1981 in India, these results indicate the possible impacts of
   urbanization on extreme rainfall trends and patterns.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is the key climatic variable that governs the regional
   hydrologic cycle and availability of water resources. Recent studies
   have analysed the changes in rainfall patterns at global as well as
   regional scales in Australia. Recent studies have also suggested that
   any analysis of hydroclimatic variables should be performed at the local
   scale rather than at a large or global scale because the trends and
   their effects may be different from one location to the other. Because
   no studies were found specific to the Yarra River catchment, which is an
   important catchment in Victoria, Australia, this study performs a
   spatiotemporal trend analysis on long-term rainfall records at 15
   measuring stations within the catchment. The Mann-Kendall test was used
   to detect trends, and Sen's slope estimator was used to calculate the
   slopes in both monthly and annual rainfall. Moreover, a cumulative
   summation technique was used to identify the trend beginning year, and
   prewhitening criteria were tested to check for autocorrelation in the
   data. The results showed that the monthly rainfall has generally
   decreasing trends except in January and June. Significant decreasing
   rainfall trends were observed in May (among the autumn months of March,
   April and May) at most stations and also in some other months at several
   stations. A decreasing trend was also observed in the annual rainfall at
   all stations. This study indicates that there has been a consistent
   reduction in rainfall over the catchment, both spatially and temporally
   over the past 50years, which will have important implications for the
   future management of water resources. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Title = {Large Increasing Trend of Tropical Cyclone Rainfall in Taiwan and the

Abstract = {Taiwan, which is in the middle of one of the most active of the western
   North Pacific Ocean's tropical cyclone (TC) zones, experienced a
   dramatic increase in typhoon-related rainfall in the beginning of the
   twenty-first century. This record-breaking increase has led to
   suggestions that it is the manifestation of the effects of global
   warming. With rainfall significantly influenced by its steep terrain,
   Taiwan offers a natural laboratory to study the role that terrain
   effects may play in the climate change of TC rainfall. Here, it is shown
   that most of the recently observed large increases in typhoon-related
   rainfall are the result of slow-moving TCs and the location of their
   tracks relative to the meso--scale terrain. In addition, stronger
   interaction between the typhoon circulation and southwest monsoon wind
   surges after the typhoon center moves into the Taiwan Strait may cause a
   long-term trend of increasing typhoon rainfall intensity, which is not
   observed before the typhoon center exits Taiwan. The variation in the
   location of the track cannot be related to the effects of global warming
   on western North Pacific TC tracks reported in the literature. The
   weaker steering flow and the stronger monsoon-TC interaction are
   consistent with the recently discovered multidecadal trend of
   intensifying subtropical monsoon and tropical circulations, which is
   contrary to some theoretical and model projections of global warming.
   There is also no evidence of a positive feedback between global
   warming-related water vapor supply and TC intensity, as the number of
   strong landfalling TCs has decreased significantly since 1960 and the
   recent heavy rainfall typhoons are all of weak-to-medium intensity.},

Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Number = {6},
Pages = {577-580},

Abstract = {It is now widely accepted(1-5) that the mean world climate has warmed
   since the beginning of climatologically significant anthropogenic
   emission of greenhouse gases. Warming may be accompanied(6-8) by changes
   in the rate of extreme weather events such as severe storms and drought.
   Here we use hourly precipitation data from 13 stations in the 48
   contiguous United States to determine trends in the frequency of such
   events, taking the normalized variance and a renormalized fourth moment
   of the precipitation measurements, averaged over decades, as objective
   measures of the frequency and severity of extreme weather. Using data
   mostly from the period 1940-1999 but also two longer data series,
   periods that include the rapid warming that seems to have begun at
   approximately 1970, we find a significant increase of 6.5 +/- 1.3\%(1
   sigma) per decade in the normalized variance at a site on the Olympic
   Peninsula at which it is low. We place statistical limits on any trend
   at the remaining 12 sites, where the normalized variance and its
   uncertainty are larger. At most sites these limits are consistent with
   the same rate of linear increase as at the Olympic Peninsula site, but
   exclude the same rate of percentage increase.},

Title = {On the relation between large-scale circulation pattern and heavy rain

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a statistical downscaling method in
   which the relationships between present-day daily weather patterns and
   local rainfall data are derived and used to project future shifts in the
   frequency of heavy rainfall events under changing global climate
   conditions. National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the
   National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data
   from wet season months (November to April) 1958-2010 are composited for
   heavy rain days at 12 rainfall stations in the Hawaiian Islands. The
   occurrence of heavy rain events (days with amounts above the 90th
   percentile estimated from all wet season rain days 1958-2010) was found
   to be strongly correlated with upper level cyclonic circulation
   anomalies centered northwest of Hawaii and south-to-north transport of
   water vapor in the middle troposphere. The statistical downscaling model
   (SD) developed in this study was able to reproduce the observed
   interannual variations in the number of heavy rain events based on
   cross-validation resampling during the more recent interval 1978-2010.
   However, multidecadal changes associated with the mid-1970s' climate
   shift were not well reproduced by the SD using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis
   data, likely due to inhomogenities in the presatellite period of the
   NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. Application of the SD to two model scenarios from
   the CMIP3 database indicates a reduction of heavy rain events in the
   mid- to late 21st century. Based on these models, the likelihood of a
   widespread increase in synoptic heavy rain events in Hawaii as a result
   of anthropogenic climate change is low over the remainder of the
   century.},

Abstract = {Peninsular India and Sri Lanka receive major part of their annual
   rainfall during the northeast monsoon season (October-December). The
   long-term trend in the northeast monsoon rainfall over the Indian Ocean
   and peninsular India is examined in the vicinity of global warming
   scenario using the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP)
   dataset available for the period 1979-2010. The result shows a
   significant increasing trend in rainfall rate of about 0.5 mm day(-1)
   decade(-1) over a large region bounded by 10 A degrees S-10 A degrees N
   and 55 A degrees E-100 A degrees E. The interannual variability of
   seasonal rainfall rate over peninsular India using conventional rain
   gauge data is also investigated in conjunction to the Indian Ocean
   dipole. The homogeneous rain gauge data developed by Indian Institute of
   Tropical Meteorology over peninsular India also exhibit the considerable
   upward rainfall trend of about 0.4 mm day(-1) decade(-1) during this
   period. The associated outgoing longwave radiation shows coherent
   decrease in the order of 2 W m(-2) decade(-1) over the rainfall increase

Abstract = {The temporal and spatial analyses of rainfall and temperature were
   conducted for understanding spatial variability and climate trend on
   Jeju Island. Rainfall data from 1992 to 2009 were used for the spatial
   analyses, and missing data were adjusted on Mt. Halla and along the
   northeast coast to reduce uncertainty of spatial variability. In
   addition, rainfall time series data of both Jeju City and Seogwipo City
   from 1961 to 2009 were analyzed for a long-term trend and identification
   of droughts. Mean annual rainfall for the period 1992-2009 shows an area
   of maximum rainfall centered around Mt. Halla where maximum annual
   rainfall reaches more than 4,300 mm and mean island rainfall is 2,082
   mm. Upward trends in rainfall intensity, magnitude, and dryness
   conditions at the Jeju City and Seogwipo City from 1961 to 2009 suggest
   that rainfall has intensified with greater quantities of rainfall
   occurring over shorter durations, with longer dry periods between storm
   events. The annual cycle shows a distinct monsoon signature with peak
   rainfall typically occurring in August. Rainfall seasonality shows a
   shift in peak rainfall from June, July, and August, to July, August, and
   September. The most severe droughts in the period 1961-2009 were
   identified using a 12-month composite SPI. Three severe droughts each
   lasting around two years were identified over a relatively short
   nine-year period from 1964-1972.},

Abstract = {The simulations of the fifth Coupled Models Intercomparison Project
   (CMIP5) strengthen previous assessments of a substantial role of
   anthropogenic emissions in driving precipitation changes in the Sahel,
   the semiarid region at the southern edge of the Sahara. Historical
   simulations can capture the magnitude of the centennial Sahel drying
   over the span of the 20th century and confirm that anthropogenic
   forcings have contributed substantially to it. Yet, the models do not
   reproduce the amplitude of observed oscillations at multidecadal
   timescales, suggesting that either oscillations in the forcing or the
   strength of natural variability are underestimated. Projections for
   Sahel rainfall are less robust than the 20th century hindcast and
   outlier projections persist, but overall the CMIP5 models confirm the
   CMIP3 results in many details and reaffirm the prediction of a rainy
   season that is more feeble at its start, especially in West Africa, and
   more abundant at its core across the entire Sahel. Out of 20 models,
   four buck this consensus. Idealized simulations from a subset of the
   CMIP5 ensemble-simulations designed to separate the fast land-atmosphere
   response to increased greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the slow response
   mediated through changes in sea surface temperature (SST)-confirm that
   the direct effect of CO2 is to enhance the monsoon, while warmer SST
   induce drying over the Sahel. At the same time, these simulations
   suggest that the seasonal evolution of the rainfall trends in the
   scenario simulations, spring drying and fall wetting, is an inherently
   coupled response, not captured by the linear superposition of the fast
   and slow response to CO2. Citation: Biasutti, M. (2013), Forced Sahel

Abstract = {Changes in climate may lead to abrupt variation in extreme rainfall
   intensity in many regions. Keeping in mind the non-stationary climate
   conditions, it is essential to incorporate potential future changes in
   hydrological studies. In present study, the variability in time series
   of extreme daily rainfall has been analyzed using Generalized Extreme
   Value (GEV) distribution (Type I) and its suitability has been examined
   by superimposing on to Gringorten plotting positions. The trend analysis
   of extreme daily rainfall is carried out using an innovative methodology
   proposed by Sen (2012) and non parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test.
   The trend detection and variability of extreme daily rainfall of four
   rain gauge stations namely Bhusaval, Burhanpur, Gidhade and Ukai over
   Tapi basin, India is also carried out in this study. More than 30 years
   of rainfall data have been used for aforesaid analysis. The statistical
   parameters like standard deviation, coefficient of variance and
   coefficient of skewness are also determined for extreme annual daily
   rainfall time series. All the data points of the time series are found
   to be well within the calculated values of high and low outliers. Also
   the time series of the extreme daily rainfall have been checked for
   their serial correlation. The peak values observed during the period
   taken into consideration at stations Bhusaval, Burhanpur, Gidhade and
   Ukai are 229.2mm, 246.2 mm, 168.8 mm and 483.1 mm having a return period
   of 68, 57, 65 and 68 years respectively along with an increasing trend
   in extreme daily rainfall at all stations except for a decreasing trend
   at Ukai.},

Abstract = {The extreme rainfall events have received especial focus in the climate
   literature due to their potential for causing soil erosion, runoff and,
   soil water saturation. Thus, the aims of the study were (i) to evaluate
   the presence of trends, temporal persistence and periodical components
   in the seasonal maximum daily rainfall values (Preabs) obtained from the
   weather station of Campinas, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil (1890-2012) and,
   (ii) to verify the possibility of using the General Extreme Value
   distribution (GEV) for modeling the probability of occurrence of these
   extreme rainfall events. The spectral analysis carried out on the
   time-frequency domain has shown no significant periodicity associated
   with the variance peaks of the time series under analysis. Based on
   parametric and non parametric methods and also considering the
   significance levels usually adopted in the scientific literature (10 and
   5\%), the Preabs values showed no significant climate trend. The results
   obtained from qualitative and quantitative goodness-of-fit procedures
   pointed out that a stationary-GEV model, with time-independent
   parameters, may be used to describe the probabilistic structure of this
   meteorological variable.},

Journal = {FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN},

Abstract = {Water has always been the focus of living things and civilizations have
   been established mainly in areas close to water. However, to meet the
   growing need for water, measures were taken such as transporting water
   from areas with abundant water to areas with water scarcity. The most
   effective method is to examine the behavior of water in the past and to
   estimate its future behavior. On the other hand, excess water, which is
   transported at the time of a flood carries a lot of sediment and
   transported sediment results in significant losses during floods. Thus,
   it is also important to know the change of sediment transport with water
   over time. In addition, possible rainfall which may come in future needs
   to be estimated by looking also at the history of rainfall that comes
   with rain. Excessive rains cause flooding and sediment transported by
   the flood causes erosion. Therefore, in this study, the relationship
   among Sakarya River streamflow and sediment transported with rainfall is
   analyzed by applying trend analysis. The Mann-Kendall test and Spearman
   Rho test were used in the study. The Mann-Kendall Rank Correlation test
   was used to determine the trend's starting year. An analysis of test
   results revealed a downward trend in The Spearman's Rho test and
   Mann-Kendall test. In Mann-Kendall Order Correlation test conducted to
   obtain the starting year of the trend, a direct relationship was found
   among the starting years of the tend in each parameter. Thus, the trends
   declining also for each parameters show a direct relationship among the
   streamflow, sediment and rainfall. In addition, downward trends in test
   statistics of Sakarya River also indicate that water will decrease in
   next years. Thus, to leave a healthy and adequate amount of water to the
   next generations, Turkey should preserve and rationally use its sources.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to obtain a better understanding of
   the space time variability of rainfall and trends of streamflow in the
   Alto So Francisco River basin using statistical tools. This basin covers
   one of the most important hydrological regions of Brazil and includes
   several states. A detailed statistical analysis applied to the river
   streamflow and rainfall time series of all gauges indicates that
   rainfall is highly temporally variable and there is a decrease in the
   annual rainfall amount for the period studied (1978-2007). The annual
   streamflow variation has a cyclic behaviour with a period length of
   approximately 10 years. In addition, a cross wavelet transform analysis
   between the monthly rainfall and reservoir inflows is applied, showing
   phase behaviour in all significant sections. However, there are no signs
   of any significant rainfall reduction in the basin, and in fact, some
   raingauges show a small rainfall increase during decades.},

Abstract = {The impacts of the thermal forcing over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in
   spring on changes in summer rainfall in China are investigated using
   historical records from the period between 1980 and 2008. The spring
   sensible heat (SH) flux and snow depth over the TP both decreased over
   this time period, although the trend in SH was more significant than
   that in snow depth. The similarity between patterns of precipitation
   trends over China and corresponding patterns of regression coefficients
   on the leading mode of spring SH change over the TP demonstrates the
   distinct contribution of changes in TP SH during spring. Enhanced
   precipitation in southern China was accompanied by increases in heavy
   rainfall, precipitation intensity, and the frequency of precipitation
   events, while reduced precipitation in northern China and northeastern
   China was primarily associated with decreases in the frequency of
   precipitation events. Further analysis using observational data and
   numerical simulations reveals that the reductions in SH over the TP have
   weakened the monsoon circulation and postponed the seasonal reversal of
   the land-sea thermal contrast in East Asia. In addition, the positive
   spring SH anomaly may generate a stronger summer atmospheric heat source
   over the TP due to the positive feedback between diabatic heating and
   local circulation.},

Abstract = {A trend analysis of stream discharge from the upper Mortes watershed,
   southern Amazon, was performed using discharge and rainfall data in
   order to investigate the temporal variability of stream discharge, and
   relate it to associated rainfall variability. Non-parametric tests were
   done on daily, seasonal and annual discharge data. Frequency analysis
   using wavelet transform was also done. Results indicate increasing
   trends in discharge. The wavelet analysis identified dry periods; i.e.
   1967-1975, 1982-1986 and 1993, which were followed by wet periods. In
   some cases, discharge increases could not be satisfactorily correlated
   to the rainfall. Further interpretation of the data for possible causes
   of streamflow changes is needed and discussion of the implications of
   these results in the context of climate change, deforestation and water
   resource management.},

Abstract = {Long-term trends of Palembang rainfall are used to evaluate the climate
   change signal. The result shows that the long-term trend in Palembang
   rainfall is seasonally dependent. It indicates two distinct
   characteristics: a wetting trend during the southeast monsoon season
   (June-August) and a drying trend during the northwest monsoon season
   (December-February). This implies that there are a wetting-trend during
   dry-season and a drying-trend during rainy-season. Furthermore, a
   drying-trend is also observed during the monsoon break season in
   March-May and September-November. A positive-trend in rainfall during
   June-August is 4.57 mm/year, while the strongest negative-trend in
   rainfall observed during December - February is - 16.02 mm/year. The
   variability of Palembang rainfall is linked to a coupled
   ocean-atmosphere mode in the tropical Indian and Pacific oceans. The
   connection between the seasonal rainfall variations and Indo-Pacific
   climate variability is demonstrated by the simultaneous correlations
   between the sea surface temperature (SST) and the Palembang rainfall.
   The SST anomaly in the tropical regions affects the climate and general
   circulation through change in the Walker circulation (e.g. Indian Ocean
   Dipole and ENSO events).},

   State, Meteorological, and Urban Dynamics},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {The present study focuses on analyzing the precipitation trends over six
   Indian cities during the summer monsoon (June-September) covering the
   period 1951-2007 and also attempting to investigate possible urban
   forcing and dynamics by examining the variation in precipitation in the
   upwind and downwind directions. The analysis shows negative trends in
   the total number of rainy days over Hyderabad (-10.4\%), Kanpur
   (-7.1\%), Jaipur (-10.5\%), and Nagpur (-4.8\%) and positive trends over
   Delhi (7.4\%) and Bangalore (22.9\%). On the other hand, decreases of
   -21.3\%, -5.9\%, -14.2\%, and -14.6\% in seasonal rainfall are found
   over Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, and Kanpur, respectively, whereas
   Bangalore and Nagpur show 65.8\% and 13.5\% increase. The lesser
   rainfall and rainy days, along with the mostly declining trend, in the
   downwind directions of the cities may imply an urban influence in
   precipitation associated with the increased anthropogenic emissions due
   to expansion of the urban areas and the increase of population. However,
   the large spatiotemporal variability of precipitation and the lack of
   statistical significance in the vastmajority of the trends do not allow
   the extraction of safe conclusion concerning the aerosol-precipitation
   interactions around Indian cities.},

Title = {Trends in Australian rainfall: contribution of tropical cyclones and

Volume = {40},

Pages = {317-326},

Abstract = {Over the past 40 years there have been significant changes in Australian
   rainfall with increases in the north-west and decreases in the east.
   Tropical cyclones (TCs) and other closed low pressure systems are
   important synoptic systems that provide a large proportion of
   Australia's annual rainfall. This study examines the proportion of
   rainfall that can be attributed to TCs over the 1970-2009 period, and to
   TCs combined with other closed lows over the 1989-2009 period. The
   contribution of these systems to Australian rainfall trends is also
   analysed. Tropical cyclones are found to have little influence on
   rainfall trends over the full time period. However, when the more recent
   21-year period is considered, TCs and other closed low pressure systems
   can partially explain the positive rainfall trend in the north-west.
   Similarly, other closed low pressure systems, such as cut-off lows and
   east coast lows, can explain some of the negative rainfall trend in the
   south-east. The contribution of TCs and other closed low pressure
   systems to rainfall trends in the north and south-east is found to be
   predominantly due to respective increases and decreases in the rainfall
   producing efficiency of the systems. An understanding of the influence
   of these synoptic systems on Australian rainfall in the current climate
   is vital for evaluating how Australia's water budget may change in
   future climates.},

Abstract = {Climate change is likely to impact on the magnitude and frequency of
   extreme flow events. Whilst flood data have traditionally been assumed
   to remain stationary, this may no longer be the case due to the effects
   of climate change. A number of studies have demonstrated trends and
   variability in annual maximum flood data across Australia. These
   findings have been supported by Australian climate change studies, which
   predict increases in extreme rainfalls, increasing evaporation and
   changes to soil moisture conditions. However, what it is more uncertain
   is the magnitude of these changes, the specific changes at a regional
   scale and the impact on catchment characteristics at the local scale and
   how this affects catchment response when a hydrologic model is to be
   developed.
   This study investigates trends in loss parameters using an event-based
   rainfall-runoff model, for four catchments across eastern New South
   Wales. These catchments include the Orara River, Ourimbah Creek,
   Currambene Creek and Pambula River. The analysis explores three loss
   models, the initial loss-continuing loss (IL-CL) model, initial
   loss-proportional loss (IL-PL) model and Soil Water balance MODel
   (SWMOD). Trends were investigated for the loss parameters of all three
   loss models, including the initial loss (IL), continuing loss (CL),
   proportional loss (PL) and initial moisture (IM, from SWMOD). The
   relationship between trends in loss parameters and trends in the annual
   maximum flow series, antecedent precipitation index, annual runoff
   totals, annual rainfall totals, number of rainy days and inter-event
   duration are also examined.
   In this study, four tests were adopted to test for trends, namely the
   Mann-Kendall, linear regression, CUSUM and cumulative deviation tests.
   Results from the tests of change and visual analyses show that for two
   of the four catchments there is strong evidence of an upward trend in
   the IL data, strong evidence of a downward trend in the IM data and
   strong evidence of a downward trend in the API data (28 days). The
   changes in the initial condition for rainfall-runoff modelling (IL and
   IM) correspond well to the trends in the API, as surrogate for the
   antecedent moisture content. Only one of the catchments saw a change in
   the continuing loss measures (CL and PL), however, this is also the only
   catchment that shows evidence of trends in the annual flood series.},

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal variability of rainfall over different seasons
   influence physical, social and economic parameters. Pre-monsoon (March,
   April and May - MAM) rainfall over the country is highly variable. Since
   heat lows and convective rainfall in MAM have an impact on the intensity
   of the ensuing monsoons, hence the pre-monsoon period was chosen for the
   study. The pre-whitened Mann Kendall test was used to explore presence
   of rainfall trend during MAM. The results indicate presence of
   significant (at 10\% level) increasing trend in two stations (Ajmer,
   Bikaner). The practical significance of the change in rainfall was also
   explored as percentage changes over long term mean, using Theil and
   Sen's median slope estimator. Forecast using univariate ARIMA model for
   pre-monsoon months indicates that there is a significant rise in the
   pre-monsoon rainfall over the northwest part of the country. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Landslides related to heavy rainfall cause widespread property damage
   and occasional loss of lives. During the last ten years it has become
   evident that the most devastating landslide events tend to occur as a
   result of comparatively short duration, high intense rainfall compared
   to the previously had lower intense prolonged rainfalls. At a time when
   climate change and global warming issues are considered as hot topics,
   it is required to evaluate the changes and their impacts on landslides
   frequencies in Sri Lanka. This study looks at extreme rain conditions in
   the context of climate change in landslide prone districts in Sri Lanka.
   Mainly two trend patterns, - seasonal distribution of landslides and
   Annual total time series distribution of landslides were developed to
   get the effect of climate changes in selected landslide prone districts
   in Sri Lanka. Identification of extreme rainfall condition were done
   based on data collected from the Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka
   The possible trends are discussed using above rainfall variations and
   the collected landslide frequency data.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is the key hydro-climatic variable that governs the regional
   hydrologic cycle and availability of water resources. Recent studies
   have analysed the changes in rainfall patterns at global as well as
   regional scales around the world. These studies have also suggested that
   any analysis of hydro-climatic variables should be performed at the
   local scale rather than at a large or global scale because the trends
   and their effects may be different from one location to the other.
   The Tamarabarani River basin is one of the important basins in Southern
   Tamil Nadu with rich surface water resources. The basin is mainly
   agriculture based and people are engaged in the cultivation of various
   crops like paddy, cotton, sugarcane, groundnut, etc. The Tamarabarani
   River provides consistent irrigation to a large agricultural area within
   the basin. The Tamarabarani River and its tributaries have many dams,
   with reservoirs providing water for irrigation and power generation. The
   Papanasam and Manimuthar dams located on the western part of the basin
   are two of the major reservoirs that cater to the water requirements of
   the district. The basin receives a majority of its rainfall during the
   northeast monsoon, which is during the months of October, November and
   December (with November having the maximum rainfalls). Thus, step
   changes and trends in rainfall for these stations and during the monsoon
   months would especially be of interest to the farmers, irrigators and
   water resource managers in the basin.
   Since no studies on hydro-climatic trend analysis were found specific to
   this basin, this study performs a spatiotemporal trend analysis on
   long-term rainfall records (1971-2000) at 14 measuring stations within
   the basin. The Mann-Kendall test was used to detect trends and the
   cumulative summation (CUSUM) technique was used to identify the trend
   beginning year for monthly rainfall data.
   The results of the CUSUM test indicated that the two stations of
   Papanasam and Dam Camp located in the Western Ghats had a statistically
   significant step-up change during the late nineteen seventies and early
   eighties. The trend analysis results indicated that increasing trends
   were observed (for most of the months) at 3 stations, which are Dam
   Camp, Papanasam and Cheranmadevi. The Cheranmadevi station exhibited the
   maximum number of months (seven out of twelve) with statistically
   significant increasing trends. For Papanasam and Cheranmadevi, the month
   of November exhibited statistically significant increasing trends. This
   is encouraging from the irrigation point of view, since these stations
   are located on the forested western part of the basin, which forms the
   catchment area for the major reservoirs. Thus, there is an increase in
   potential for harvesting water from this part of the basin.
   On the other hand, it is observed that five stations have exhibited
   predominantly decreasing trends for most of the months during the past
   three decades. These stations are Tirunelveli, Manimuthar, Nanguneri,
   Kovilpatti and Ayyikudi. Most of these stations are located in the
   central part of the river basin and these areas would need special
   attention as over exploitation of surface as well as ground water
   resources in these regions need to be restricted to conserve water for
   future use.},

Abstract = {Drought, a normal recurrent event in arid and semiarid lands such as
   Iran, is typically of a temporary nature usually leaving little
   permanent aftermath. In the current study, the rainfall and drought
   severity time series were analyzed at 10 stations in the eastern half of
   Iran for the period 1966-2005. The drought severity was computed using
   the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for a 12-month timescale. The
   trend analyses of the data were also performed using the Kendall and
   Spearman tests. The results of this study showed that the rainfall and
   drought severity data had high variations to average values in the study
   period, and these variations increased with increasing aridity towards
   the south of the study area. The negative serial correlations found in
   the seasonal and annual rainfall time series were mostly insignificant.
   The trend tests detected a significant decreasing trend in the spring
   rainfall series of Birjand station at the rate of 8.56?mm per season per
   decade and a significant increasing trend in the summer rainfall series
   of Torbateheydarieh station at the rate of 0.14?mm per season per
   decade, whereas the rest of the trends were insignificant. Furthermore,
   the 12-month values of the standardized precipitation index decreased at
   all the stations except Zabol during the past four decades. During the
   study period, all of the stations experienced at least one extreme
   drought which mainly occurred in the winter season. Copyright (C) 2011

Title = {Tropical cyclone and extreme rainfall trends in East Asian summer
   monsoon since mid-20th century},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {Proper interpretations of extreme rainfall trends in the Asian monsoon
   regions are complicated by tropical cyclones (TCs) from tropical oceans,
   whose rainfall trend may be different from the local monsoon (non-TC)
   rain. Here we show that the trends over the China summer monsoon region
   have been distorted by western North Pacific typhoons, which bring
   rainfall with decreasing frequency and increasing intensity. Typically
   the latter is not sufficient to overcome the former, so TC-related
   extreme rainfall trend is smaller than monsoon-related extreme rainfall.
   The net impact underestimates the increasing trend and overestimates the
   decreasing trend in monsoon extreme rainfall over most areas. The effect
   is minimal in the Meiyu rain belt region, but reaches 30\% in
   northeastern and southern China. The largest distortions occur on
   offshore islands in the main TC paths that underwent significant decadal
   variations. In Hainan, the -3\%/decade trend becomes +7\%/decade if
   typhoon rainfall is removed. An opposite case occurs in Taiwan, where
   the extreme rainfall trend is hugely inflated by local increases in TC
   rainfall. These opposite effects emphasize the importance of considering
   the different mechanisms of rainfall systems in order to avoid
   mis-attribution of regional effects on extreme rainfall to thermodynamic
   consequences of global warming. Citation: Chang, C.-P., Y. Lei, C.-H.

Abstract = {In this paper, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for extreme
   rainfall over the entire U.K. The model is based around a strong
   regional structure, so that for each of nine distinct physiographic
   regions, we impose a distinct model for the marginal behaviour that
   employs site-specific covariate information, and a model for the
   dependence structure. Using data collected at 204 locations over a
   40-year period, the model is designed to meet the challenges posed by
   the problem, specifically: the distinct extremal behaviour in the
   different regions; the need to model extremal dependence for up to 25
   sites within a region; and the possibility of temporal trends within the
   extreme rainfall climate. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {The present study examines the characteristics and climatological
   features of daily rainfall data over Andaman \& Nicobar Islands.
   Analysis of rainfall data reveals a large monthly deviation over the
   northern latitudes as compare to southern latitudes of Andaman \&
   Nicobar Islands. Also, it is found that rainfall increases from north to
   south latitudes in all the seasons except monsoon, where a reverse
   pattern exists. In trend analysis, a statistically significant
   decreasing trend (confidence level > 95 \%) is observed for yearly
   rainfall and rainy days over the region. Analysis of daily rainfall
   intensity for each year shows increasing trend for frequency of rather
   heavy rain (35.6-64.4 mm) and significant decreasing trend for
   frequencies of light rain (2.5-7.5 mm), and very heavy rain (> 124.5 mm)
   over the region. Many times, very heavy rain events are associated with
   cyclonic disturbances affecting Andaman \& Nicobar Islands region. The
   analysis of cyclonic disturbances over the region reveals a stronger and
   more significant decreasing trend. So, one of the causes for decreasing
   trend in very heavy rain over Andaman \& Nicobar Islands may be due to
   significant decreasing frequency of cyclonic disturbances affecting this
   region.},

   analytical (parametric) and the empirical (bootstrap) techniques were
   used to incorporate the impact of spatial correlation in regional
   trends. It is observed that, consideration of spatial correlation
   reduces the significance level of the trends and the effective number of
   grid points falling under each category. Especially, the noticeable
   cross-correlation have reduced the significance of the trends in
   moderate and long spell rain events to a large extent, while the
   significance of trends in the extreme heavy and short spell events is
   not highly affected because of small cross-correlation.},

Title = {Trends in weekly reported net use by children during and after rainy
   season in central Tanzania},
Journal = {MALARIA JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Background: The use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is one of
   the principal interventions to prevent malaria in young children,
   reducing episodes of malaria by 50\% and child deaths by one fifth.
   Prioritizing young children for net use is important to achieve
   mortality reductions, particularly during transmission seasons.
   Methods: Households were followed up weekly from January through June
   2009 to track net use among children under seven under as well as
   caretakers. Net use rates for children and caretakers in net-owning
   households were calculated by dividing the number of person-weeks of net
   use by the number of person-weeks of follow-up. Use was stratified by
   age of the child or caretaker status. Determinants of ownership and of
   use were assessed using multivariate models.
   Results: Overall, 60.1\% of the households reported owning a bed net at
   least once during the study period. Among net owners, use rates remained
   high during and after the rainy season. Rates of use per person-week
   decreased as the age of the child rose from 0 to six years old; at ages
   0-23 months and 24-35 months use rates per person-week were 0.93 and
   0.92 respectively during the study period, while for children ages 3 and
   4 use rates per person-week were 0.86 and 0.80. For children ages 5-6
   person-week ratios dropped to 0.55. This represents an incidence rate
   ratio of 1.67 for children ages 0-23 months compared to children aged
   5-6. Caretakers had use rates similar to those of children age 0-35
   months. Having fewer children under age seven in the household also
   appeared to positively impact net use rates for individual children.
   Conclusions: In this area of Tanzania, net use is very high among
   net-owning households, with no variability either at the beginning or
   end of the rainy season high transmission period. The youngest children
   are prioritized for sleeping under the net and caretakers also have high
   rates of use. Given the high use rates, increasing the number of nets
   available in the household is likely to boost use rates by older
   children.},

Title = {Trends of Convective Available Potential Energy over the Indian region
   and its effect on rainfall},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1362-1372},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Many studies in recent times have suggested that long-term changes in
   Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) are associated with the
   changes in convective activity and atmospheric energy budget and, hence,
   the changes in CAPE could be used as a potential indicator of climate
   change. Here, we analyse daily radiosonde data of 32 stations over the
   Indian region from 1984 to 2008 (25 years), to study the climatology and
   long-term changes in CAPE, lower troposphere moisture content and upper
   tropospheric temperature. Using gridded daily rainfall data over this
   region, the relationship between average CAPE and average rainfall as
   well as the trends in CAPE and its effect on rainfall pattern are also
   examined during different seasons of this region. All the coastal and
   island stations, as well as some stations in the foothills of the
   Himalayas, show higher values of CAPE compared to other inland stations.
   This study clearly demonstrates that CAPE values have been
   systematically increasing over most parts of the Indian region during
   last 25 years. The increase in CAPE is found to be due to increase in
   low-level moisture content and decrease in upper level temperature over
   the last 25 years. The seasonal variations show that the CAPE is higher
   during the monsoon compared to pre-monsoon or post-monsoon seasons and
   it suggests that thermodynamic conditions favourable for high CAPE
   together with large-scale dynamics are necessary for organized monsoon
   convections over this region. In comparison with a large increase in the
   all-India average of CAPE during monsoon season, which is about 38 J
   Kg-1 year-1, the all-India summer monsoon rainfall increases about 1.3
   mm year-1. The systematic increasing trend in CAPE may be compensating
   for weakening of monsoon circulation and, thus, maintaining the monsoon
   rainfall over the Indian region. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal Meteorological

Title = {Long term trends in rainfall and its probability for crop planning in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {74-78},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Annual and weekly rainfall data for the period of 69 years (1942-2008)
   of Datia and (1939-2007) of Jalaun districts of Bundelkhand region were
   analyzed. The overall mean annual rainfall was 778.8 mm with 27.3\%
   variability for Jalaun and 831.8 mm with 30.3 \% variability for Datia
   region. Mann-Kendall rank statistics and Gaussian low pass filter
   revealed the long-term a decreasing trend in total amount of annual
   rainfall at Jalaun. However, in past 13 years (1996 to 2008), both
   regions exhibited significant decreasing trend in total amount of annual
   rainfall. At Datia, the probability more than 10 mm during 26th (25
   June-1 July) and 27th (2-7, July) standard meteorological week (SMW)
   suggested to initiate field preparation operation for Kharif crop and
   sowing in subsequent week due to assured probability (70\%) of more than
   20 mm rainfall. The 27th and 28th (8-15, July) SMW is also an ideal time
   for the crop fertilization. Overall expected rainfall for getting more
   than 20 mm rainfall at 60\% probability level is for 10 weeks at Datia
   suggesting that short duration varieties of various crops can be ideal
   in the region. At Jalaun, the trend analysis showed that field operation
   may be a week delay than Datia due to late onset on monsoon. Therefore,
   the ideal combination of crops of the regions may be sorghum for the
   grain purpose intercropped with cowpea for the fodder purpose as
   livestock is an integral part of rainfed rural economy.},

Title = {Dynamics of east-west asymmetry of Indian summer monsoon rainfall trends
   in recent decades},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {39},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Understanding the regional trends in Indian summer monsoon rainfall has
   important implications in developing appropriate adaptation strategies.
   Here, we provide a mechanistic explanation of the observed asymmetry in
   the trends of seasonal mean rainfall during past three decades over the
   eastern and western parts of the country. This asymmetry in trends of
   the seasonal mean rainfall is primarily contributed by a similar
   asymmetry in the trends of low and medium rainfall (R-LMR) events
   explaining 85\% of the seasonal mean. As the R-LMR generally comes from
   mesoscale and synoptic systems, it is likely that the observed asymmetry
   may arise from some asymmetry in changes in large scale dynamic and
   thermodynamic parameters. We show that increasing vertically integrated
   moisture transport (VIMT) over the Arabian Sea (AS) is likely reason for
   the increasing trend of R-LMR in the western parts during recent
   decades. In contrast, over the eastern parts, the R-LMR is decreasing
   due to a decreasing trend of VIMT over the Bay of Bengal (BoB). The
   increasing trend of VIMT over AS arises primarily due to increasing
   trends of low level wind speed and moisture content while the decreasing
   trend of VIMT over the BoB seems to be due to decreasing trends of low
   level wind speed and moisture content. Citation: Konwar, M., A. Parekh,

Title = {The influence of changes in synoptic regimes on north Australian wet
   season rainfall trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Precipitation over the north of Australia mainly falls during the wet
   season and is associated with the Australian monsoon. Recent studies
   have shown that precipitation in the north and northwest of Australia
   during the wet season has increased over the past 50 years. In previous
   work, daily radiosonde data at a single site (Darwin) were used to
   identify five distinct wet season regimes, each associated with a
   characteristic synoptic circulation pattern and rainfall probability
   distribution. Here the five regimes are used to decompose the 50-year
   precipitation trend at Darwin from 1957/1958-2007/2008 into two
   contributions; that due to changes in the regime relative frequency of
   occurrence, and that due to changes in the within-regime precipitation.
   Over the entire wet season from September to April, the within-regime
   precipitation does not change significantly for any of the regimes.
   However, the relative frequency of occurrence decreases significantly
   for the driest regimes, and increases significantly for one of the
   wettest regimes, suggesting that changes in the large-scale circulation
   are a more important contributor to the precipitation trends than are
   thermodynamic changes. During December to March, the largest
   contributions to the total precipitation trend come from changes in all
   three of the wettest regimes. During November and April, when the
   average precipitation is lower, there is a large relative contribution
   to the precipitation trend from the increase in frequency of a wet
   regime and a decrease in frequency of the dry regimes. This contributes
   to the significant lengthening of the north Australian wet season.},

Abstract = {In order to analyze the effects of the duration of precipitation events,
   trends in extreme rainfall over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) for multi-day
   extreme precipitation events (1 to 7 days) were evaluated from records
   of 52 observatories regularly distributed over Iberia with no missing
   data for the common period 1958-2004. Two approaches were used: first,
   the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test together with the Sen method, and
   second, a parametric test based on the statistical theory of extreme
   values, involving time-dependent parameters to account for possible
   temporal changes in the frequency distribution. It was found that, in
   winter, there were significant negative trends for a great part of the
   Iberian Peninsula, but significant positive trends for the southeast
   over areas that shrank as the number of days considered for the
   precipitation event increased. Spring also showed negative trends for a
   great part of the IP but with a major area of positive trend over the
   northeast that remained unchanged when considering the maxima of from 1
   to 7 days of rainfall. Autumn showed a bipolar spatial pattern, with the
   west being positive and the east negative.},

   degrees 49' and 5 degrees 22' West and latitudes 6 degrees 00' and 9
   degrees 26' North and covers an area of 35,500 km(2). This study aims to
   identify trends in the rainfall-runoff relationship by using a monthly
   conceptual model. The methodology has consisted on the one hand in
   highlighting the existence of interannual climate and hydrological
   variability by using the method of segmentation of Hubert, and on the
   other hand, in applying the crossed simulations method by using the GR2M
   model, over several 7-year sub-periods. The results of the application
   of the method of segmentation of Hubert have demonstrated the presence
   of a hydroclimatic variability in the N'zi watershed. The modifications
   of the climate and physical conditions of the flow resulted in a
   modification of the hydrological response of the watershed translated by
   a non-stationarity in the rainfall-runoff relation. (c) 2012 Academie

Abstract = {Analyses of six daily rainfall series (Milano, Bergamo, Brescia, Como,
   Mantova, and Sondrio) are used to assess trends in yearly precipitation
   behaviour (precipitation height and number of wet days; precipitation
   height and number of wet days for different classes of daily
   precipitation; precipitation height related to one wet day; number of
   dry days between wet days) over Lombardia, northern Italy. The time
   series analysis was performed with two non-parametric rank based tests:
   the Mann Kendall test and Sen's estimator of slope. Also a new and
   advantageous procedure that combines a time series model and Bayesian
   statistics through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method of Gibbs
   sampling is adopted to model trends. Globally, the different methods
   detect the same tendencies. The results point toward a significant
   decreasing trend in the annual number of wet days and an increasing
   tendency in the mean and maximum precipitation height related to one
   day, with a generalized increasing tendency for the number of dry days
   between wet days. These trends affect the rainfall runoff process and
   the pollutant dynamics on urban areas and in drainage systems and could
   provoke a significant efficacy reduction of existing urban quantity and
   quality control systems. Copyright (c) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

Title = {Spatiotemporal trends in erosion rates across a pronounced rainfall
   gradient: Examples from the southern Central Andes},
Journal = {EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {327},
Pages = {97-110},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The tectonic and climatic boundary conditions of the broken foreland and
   the orogen interior of the southern Central Andes of northwestern
   Argentina cause strong contrasts in elevation, rainfall, and
   surface-process regimes. The climatic gradient in this region ranges
   from the wet, windward eastern flanks (similar to 2 m/yr rainfall) to
   progressively drier western basins and ranges (similar to 0.1 m/yr)
   bordering the arid Altiplano-Puna Plateau. In this study, we analyze the
   impact of spatiotemporal climatic gradients on surface erosion: First,
   we present 41 new catchment-mean erosion rates derived from cosmogenic
   nuclide inventories to document spatial erosion patterns. Second, we
   re-evaluate paleoclimatic records from the Calchaquies basin (66 W, 26
   S), a large intermontane basin bordered by high (> 4.5 km) mountain
   ranges, to demonstrate temporal variations in erosion rates associated
   with changing climatic boundary conditions during the late Pleistocene
   and Holocene. Three key observations in this region emphasize the
   importance of climatic parameters on the efficiency of surface processes
   in space and time: (1) First-order spatial patterns of erosion rates can
   be explained by a simple specific stream power (SSP) approach. We
   explicitly account for discharge by routing high-resolution, satellite
   derived rainfall. This is important as the steep climatic gradient
   results in a highly non-linear relation between drainage area and
   discharge. This relation indicates that erosion rates (ER) scale with ER
   similar to SSP1.4 on cosmogenic-nuclide time scales. (2) We identify an
   intrinsic channel-slope behavior in different climatic compartments.
   Channel slopes in dry areas (< 0.25 m/yr rainfall) are slightly steeper
   than in wet areas (> 0.75 m/yr) with equal drainage areas, thus
   compensating lower amounts of discharge with steeper slopes. (3) Erosion
   rates can vary by an order of magnitude between presently dry (similar
   to 0.05 mm/yr) and well-defined late Pleistocene humid (similar to 0.5
   mm/yr) conditions within an intemontane basin. Overall, we document a
   strong climatic impact on erosion rates and channel slopes. We suggest
   that rainfall reaching areas with steeper channel slopes in the orogen
   interior during wetter climate periods results in intensified sediment
   mass transport, which is primarily responsible for maintaining the
   balance between surface uplift, erosion, sediment routing and transient
   storage in the orogen. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The paper presents a comparison of the rates of rainfall in fourteen
   Indian meteorological subdivisions, with fourteen major Indian cities
   located in those subdivisions. These comparisons of the rates have been
   done for both the monsoon period as well as annual rainfall. The long
   term trends of monsoon and annual rainfalls in fourteen major Indian
   cities have been reported earlier. Using WMO procedure the trends of
   rainfall on the meteorological subdivisions, consisting of fourteen
   Indian cities are calculated. The Indian cities having population more
   than 1 million are considered as urban. The meteorological subdivisions
   are considered as nonurban though a small part of it is occupied by the
   city.
   Quantitative analysis of the rainfall data over the Indian land is done
   and following important results are obtained.
   (i) the rainfall rates in most of the urban areas are higher than the
   corresponding subdivisional rates since the later part of the last
   century.
   (ii) even with the same economic trend some cities are showing reverse
   trend of rainfall compared with the corresponding subdivisions.
   (iii) subdivisional rainfalls, monsoon as well as the annual, are
   showing decreasing trend for the same period for more than 70\% cases.},

Title = {Remote Influence of the Tropical Atlantic on the Variability and Trend
   in North West Australia Summer Rainfall},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLIMATE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2408-2420},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Rainfall in North West Australia (NWA) has been increasing over the past
   decades, occurring mainly in the austral summer season (December-March).
   A range of factors such as decreased land albedo in Australia and
   increasing anthropogenic aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere, identified
   using simulations from climate models, have been implicated in this
   wetting trend. However, the impact of land albedo and aerosols on
   Australian rainfall remains unclear. In addition, previous studies
   showed that dominant sea surface temperature (SST) signals in the
   Pacific-Indian Ocean including El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), ENSO
   Modoki, and the Indian Ocean dipole mode have no significant impact on
   the NWA rainfall trend. The present study proposes another viewpoint on
   the remote influence of tropical Atlantic atmospheric vertical motion on
   the observed rainfall variability and trend in NWA.
   It is found that, with the atmospheric ascent instigated by the warming
   of SST over the tropical Atlantic, a Rossby wave train is emanating
   southeastward from off the west coast of subtropical South America to
   the midlatitudes of the South Atlantic Ocean. It then travels eastward
   embedded in the westerly jet waveguide over the South Atlantic and South
   Indian Oceans. The eastward-propagated Rossby wave induces an
   anticyclonic anomaly in the upper troposphere over Australia, which is
   at the exit of the westerly jet waveguide. This leads to an in situ
   upper-tropospheric divergence, ascending motion and a lower-tropospheric
   convergence, and the associated increase in rainfall in NWA. Thus, the
   increasing trend in atmospheric upward motion induced by the warming
   trend of SST in the tropical Atlantic may partially explain the observed
   rainfall trend in NWA.},

Abstract = {Climate change has affected the temperature and rainfall characteristics
   worldwide. However, the changes are not equal for all regions and have
   localized intensity and must be quantified locally to manage the natural
   resources. Orissa is an eastern state in India where agricultural
   activities mainly depends on the rainfall and thus face problems due to
   changing patterns of rainfall due to changing climate. In the present
   study, attempts were made to study temporal variation in monthly,
   seasonal and annual rainfall over the state during the period from 1871
   to 2006. Long term changes in rainfall characteristics were determined
   by both parametric and non-parametric tests. The analysis revealed a
   long term insignificant decline trend of annual as well as monsoon
   rainfall, where as increasing trend in post-monsoon season over the
   state of Orissa. Rainfall during winter and summer seasons showed an
   increasing trend. Statistically monsoon rainfall can be considered as
   very dependable as the coefficient of variation is 14.2\%. However,
   there is decreasing monthly rainfall trend in June, July and September,
   where as increasing trend in August. This trend is more predominant in
   last 10 year. Based on departure from mean, rainfall analysis also
   showed an increased number of dry years compared to wet years after
   1950. This changing rainfall trend during monsoon months is major
   concern for the rain-fed agriculture. More over, this will affect hydro
   power generation and reservoir operation in the region.},

Abstract = {The historical deforestation of the Upper Brahmaputra Valley in the
   Indian state of Assam has resulted in the transformation of its
   once-contiguous lowland rainforests into many isolated forest fragments
   that are still rich in species, including primates. We report the recent
   history and current status of six diurnal primates in one large (2,098
   ha) and three small (< 500 ha) fragments of the Upper Brahmaputra
   Valley. We censused primates in the small fragments during 2002, 2005,
   2009, in the large fragment in 2008, and used other published census
   data to derive population trends. We also used key informant surveys to
   obtain historical occurrence data for these populations. Our analyses
   reveal the recent extinction of some populations and the simultaneous
   long-term persistence of others in these fragments over 16 years. Most
   populations appeared to have declined in the small fragments but primate
   abundance has increased significantly in the largest fragment over the
   last decade. Addressing the biomass needs of the local human
   populations, which appears to drive habitat degradation, and better
   protection of these forests, will be crucial in ensuring the future

Abstract = {Knowing the variations in the general rainfall pattern of a river basin
   is vital to understanding the hydrological cycle and water budget of the
   basin. The present study examined the general rainfall pattern in
   Bharathapuzha River basin of Malabar coast of Kerala, using monthly
   rainfall data for 34 years collected from 28 rain gauge stations. We
   used Mann-Kendal's rank correlation statistics and wavelet analysis to
   examine the trend of rainfall. The annual rainfall, southwest monsoon,
   and pre-monsoon rainfall of the basin shows a significant decrement
   towards the later years of the study. We assume that the global climate
   and the local environmental changes are the chief factors for the
   variation. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Comprehensive flood prevention plans are established in large basins to
   cope with recent abnormal floods in South Korea. In order to make
   economically effective plans, appropriate design rainfalls are
   critically determined from the rainfall depth-frequency curves which
   take the occurrence of abnormal floods into consideration. Conventional
   approaches to construct the rainfall depth-frequency curves are based on
   the stationarity assumption. However, this assumption has a critical
   weak aspect in that it cannot reflect non-stationarities in rainfall
   observations. As an alternative, this study suggests the non-stationary
   Gumbel model (NSGM) which incorporates a linear trend of rainfall
   observations into rainfall frequency analysis to construct the rainfall
   depth-frequency curves. A comparison of various schemes employed in the
   model found that the proposed NSGM permits the estimation of the
   distribution parameters even when shifted in the future by using linear
   relationships between rainfall statistics and distribution parameters,
   and produces more acceptable estimates of design rainfalls in the future
   than the conventional model. The NSGM was applied at several stations in
   South Korea and then expected the design rainfalls to increase by up to
   15-30\% in 2050.},

Title = {Trends in rainfall intensity for stormwater designs in Ontario},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The intensities of short-duration rainfall events are fundamental inputs
   to the design of stormwater management infrastructure. However, since
   stormwater infrastructure must function as designed for many decades, if
   there are long-term trends in rainfall intensities, design storms need
   to be modified. Evidence demonstrates, using data from 13 rain gauges in
   Ontario, that storm intensities relevant to urban stormwater (5 year)
   appear to have changed over the last 30 years. The results show, for
   example, statistical significance at 80\% confidence that the 5-year
   storm has increased, and 85\% that the 2-year storm has increased, for
   the 1 h storm in Waterloo, using partial duration series (PDS) data. The
   PDS data indicate intensities are increasing at a rate of 1-3\% per
   year. Results show, for example, that a 5-year recurrence storm for PDS
   for the period 1970-1984 is now very close in magnitude to a 2-year
   recurrence storm for the period 1985-2003 for Waterloo, Ontario. The
   implications for a case study demonstrate that 5 out of 12 storm sewer
   pipes in a subdivision would need to be increased in diameter to obtain
   the same level of stormwater performance.},

   Indian rainfall extremes},
Journal = {NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {86-91},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent studies disagree on how rainfall extremes over India have changed
   in space and time over the past half century'', as well as on whether
   the changes observed are due to global warming(5,6) or regional
   urbanization(7). Although a uniform and consistent decrease in moderate
   rainfall has been reported, a lack of agreement about trends in heavy
   rainfall may be due in part to differences in the characterization and
   spatial averaging of extremes. Here we use extreme value theory(8-15) to
   examine trends in Indian rainfall over the past half century in the
   context of long-term, low-frequency variability. We show that when
   generalized extreme value theory(8,16-18) is applied to annual maximum
   rainfall over India, no statistically significant spatially uniform
   trends are observed, in agreement with previous studies using different
   approaches(2-4). Furthermore, our space-time regression analysis of the
   return levels points to increasing spatial variability of rainfall
   extremes over India. Our findings highlight the need for systematic
   examination of global versus regional drivers of trends in Indian
   rainfall extremes, and may help to inform flood hazard preparedness and
   water resource management in the region.},

Title = {Observed recent trends in tropical cyclone rainfall over the North
   Atlantic and the North Pacific},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {117},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {In this study, we use Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission and Global
   Precipitation Climatology Project rainfall data together with historical
   storm track records to examine the trend of tropical cyclone (TC)
   rainfall in the North Atlantic and the northeast and northwest Pacific
   during two recent decades (1988-1997 and 1998-2007). We find that there
   is an approximate linear relationship between TC rain (defined as
   accumulated total rainfall along storm tracks) and storm intensity as
   classified by the Saffir-Simpson scheme. During the data period, total
   TC rain has trended upward at a rate of 23.8\% +/- 23.5\% per decade
   over the North Atlantic but downward with a rate of 25.1\% +/- 19.7\%
   per decade over the northeast Pacific. Over the northwest Pacific, there
   is a reduction in TC rain of approximately 20.9\% +/- 13.5\% per decade,
   possibly associated with a strong interdecadal-scale oscillation. Storm
   characteristics such as duration and TC rain energy per storm (EPS)
   remain unchanged for the North Atlantic and the northeast Pacific. For
   the northwest Pacific, a 28\% +/- 18\% reduction in EPS from the first
   decade (1988-1997) to the second decade (1998-2007) is found with the
   track data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Analyses of the
   probability distribution function of TC rain show that there is an
   overall increase in TC frequency across the entire TC rainfall spectrum
   over the North Atlantic but an overall decrease for the northeast
   Pacific. In the northwest Pacific, we find a redistribution in EPS with
   decreased frequency in heavy-rain storms and increased frequency in
   light-rain storms. Overall, trends in TC rain in the different ocean
   basins are consistent with long-term relative changes in the ambient
   large-scale sea surface temperature and vertical wind shear and, to a
   lesser extent, tropical cyclone Maximum Potential Intensity.},

Abstract = {Hydrologic frequency analysis practically assumes that a time series of
   interest is temporally stationary. However, the assumption is sometimes
   not valid within the context of climate change. Monotonic trend tests,
   which are widely used in practice to investigate the presence of
   significant non-stationarity of hydrologic variables, can determine only
   whether a trend is significant. This study proposed a practical method
   for characterizing trend pattern embedded in hydrologic observations
   through the efficient illustration of changes in trend significance over
   time. This study analyzed the trend patterns of observed rainfalls in
   the Han River basin using Mann-Kendall test, and developed checker board
   plots to show the pattern of trend variations. The results indicate that
   the time and the magnitude of significant trend would differ by station
   although most of record periods show a certain trend of increasing
   annual maximum rainfalls.},

Abstract = {Rainfall erosivity refers to the ability of precipitation to erode soil,
   and depends on characteristics such as its total volume, duration, and
   intensity and amount of energy released by raindrops. Despite the
   relevance of rainfall erosivity for soil degradation prevention, very
   few studies have addressed its spatial and temporal variability. In this
   study the time variation of rainfall erosivity in the Ebro Valley (NE
   Spain) is assessed for the period 1955-2006. The results show a general
   decrease in annual and seasonal rainfall erosivity, which is explained
   by a decrease of very intense rainfall events whilst the frequency of
   moderate and low events increased. This trend is related to prevailing
   positive conditions of the main atmospheric teleconnection indices
   affecting the West Mediterranean, i.e. the North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO), the Mediterranean Oscillation (MO) and the Western Mediterranean
   Oscillation (WeMO).},

Abstract = {Temporal trends in meteorological extremes are often examined by first
   reducing daily data to annual index values, such as the 95th or 99th
   percentiles. Here, we report how this idea can be elaborated to provide
   an efficient test for trends at a network of stations. The initial step
   is to make separate estimates of tail probabilities of precipitation
   amounts for each combination of station and year by fitting a
   generalised Pareto distribution (GPD) to data above a user-defined
   threshold. The resulting time series of annual percentile estimates are
   subsequently fed into a multivariate Mann-Kendall (MK) test for
   monotonic trends. We performed extensive simulations using artificially
   generated precipitation data and noted that the power of tests for
   temporal trends was substantially enhanced when ordinary percentiles
   were substituted for GPD percentiles. Furthermore, we found that the
   trend detection was robust to misspecification of the extreme value
   distribution. An advantage of the MK test is that it can accommodate
   non-linear trends, and it can also take into account the dependencies
   between stations in a network. To illustrate our approach, we used long
   time series of precipitation data from a network of stations in The
   Netherlands. Copyright (C) 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

Title = {Successional Change in the Lake Superior Fish Community: Population

Abstract = {The Lake Superior fish community underwent massive changes in the second
   half of the 20th century. Those changes are largely reflected in changes
   in abundance of the adults of principal prey species, the ciscoes
   (Coregonus spp.), the invasive rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and the
   principal predator, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). To better
   understand changes in species abundances, a comprehensive series of
   gillnet and bottom trawl data collected from 1958 to 2008 were examined.
   In the late 1950s/early 1960s, smelt abundance was at its maximum, wild
   lake trout was at its minimum, and an abundance of hatchery lake trout
   was increasing rapidly. The bloater (Coregonus hoyi) was the prevalent
   cisco in the lake; abundance was more than 300\% greater than the next
   most abundant cisco, shortjaw cisco (C. zenithicus), followed by kiyi
   (C. kiyi) and lake cisco (C. artedi). By the mid-1960s, abundance of
   hatchery lake trout was nearing maximum, smelt abundance was beginning
   to decline, and abundances of all ciscoes declined, but especially that
   of shortjaw cisco and kiyi. By the late 1970s, recovery of wild lake
   trout stocks was well underway and abundances of hatchery lake trout and
   smelt were declining and the ciscoes were reaching their nadir. During
   1980-1990, the fish community underwent a dramatic shift in organization
   and structure. The rapid increase in abundance of wild lake trout,
   concurrent with a rapid decline in hatchery lake trout, signaled the
   impending recovery. Rainbow smelt abundance dropped precipitously and
   within four years, lake cisco and bloater populations rebounded on the
   heels of a series of strong recruitment events. Kiyi populations showed
   signs of recovery by 1989, and shortjaw by 2000, though well below
   historic maximum abundances. High abundance of adult smelt prior to 1980
   appears to be the only factor linked to recruitment failure in the
   ciscoes. Life history traits of the cisco species were examined to
   better understand their different responses to conditions of low and
   high predator levels, i.e., late 1950s early 1960s vs. post 1980.
   Bloaters are most likely to become the predominant cisco in the absence
   of strong predation and the least abundant under prolonged predation;
   smelt share this pattern. Conversely, the lake cisco and shortjaw cisco
   fare better when predator abundance is high. The recovery of lake trout
   in Lake Superior reestablished a strong top-down influence on the fish
   community and its present structure and organization appears to be
   approaching an equilibrium that reflects a more natural state. If lake
   trout recovery is sustained, shortjaw cisco abundance is expected to
   increase and join lake cisco and kiyi as dominant cisco species, and
   bloater and smelt will oscillate at lower abundances.},

Abstract = {Climate change is a reality which affects many climatic variables,
   including precipitation. Nevertheless, impacts on extreme events and in
   particular on daily extreme rainfall are not certain because few works
   have been devoted to them in West Africa. In this context, it was
   proposed to detect possible trends or step changes in the statistical
   properties (mean, variance) of daily extreme rainfall records using
   local and regional statistical tests. To detect these changes, the
   indices characterizing the maximum annual daily rainfall (PJmaxan), the
   annual number of daily rainfall greater than 50 mm (NJsup50) and the
   contribution of daily rainfall greater than 50 mm in annual rainfall
   (R(PJsup50/Pan)) were defined. The analysis of 44 rainfall stations in
   Ivory Coast for the period 1942-2002 does not show a change generalized
   for either mean or variance. However, by dividing the Ivory Coast into
   climatically homogeneous regions, downward trends were observed in
   regions I (North) and IV (South East).},

Abstract = {Trends in rainfall, rainy days and 24 h maximum rainfall are
   investigated using the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test at twenty-four
   sites of subtropical Assam located in the northeastern region of India.
   The trends are statistically confirmed by both the parametric and
   non-parametric methods and the magnitudes of significant trends are
   obtained through the linear regression test. In Assam, the average
   monsoon rainfall (rainy days) during the monsoon months of June to
   September is about 1606 mm (70), which accounts for about 70\% (64\%) of
   the annual rainfall (rainy days). On monthly time scales, sixteen and
   seventeen sites (twenty-one sites each) witnessed decreasing trends in
   the total rainfall (rainy days), out of which one and three trends
   (seven trends each) were found to be statistically significant in June
   and July, respectively. On the other hand, seventeen sites witnessed
   increasing trends in rainfall in the month of September, but none were
   statistically significant. In December (February), eighteen (twenty-two)
   sites witnessed decreasing (increasing) trends in total rainfall, out of
   which five (three) trends were statistically significant. For the rainy
   days during the months of November to January, twenty-two or more sites
   witnessed decreasing trends in Assam, but for nine (November), twelve
   (January) and eighteen (December) sites, these trends were statistically
   significant. These observed changes in rainfall, although most time
   series are not convincing as they show predominantly no significance,
   along with the well-reported climatic warming in monsoon and
   post-monsoon seasons may have implications for human health and water
   resources management over bio-diversity rich Northeast India. (C) 2012

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Urbanisation has burdened cities with many problems associated with
   growth and the physical environment. Some of the urban locations in
   India are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural hazards related to
   precipitation and flooding. Thus it becomes increasingly important to
   study the characteristics of these events and their physical
   explanation. This work studies rainfall trends in Delhi and Mumbai, the
   two biggest Metropolitan cities of Republic of India, during the period
   from 1951 to 2004. Precipitation data was studied on basis of months,
   seasons and years, and the total period divided in the two different
   time periods of 1951-1980 and 1981-2004 for detailed analysis. Long-term
   trends in rainfall were determined by Man-Kendall rank statistics and
   linear regression. Further this study seeks for an explanation for
   precipitation trends during monsoon period by different global climate
   phenomena. Principal component analysis and Singular value decomposition
   were used to find relation between southwest monsoon precipitation and
   global climatic phenomena using climatic indices. Most of the rainfall
   at both the stations was found out to be taking place in Southwest
   monsoon season. The analysis revealed great degree of variability in
   precipitation at both stations. There is insignificant decrease in long
   term southwest monsoon rainfall over Delhi and slight significant
   decreasing trends for long term southwest monsoon rainfall in Mumbai.
   Decrease in average maximum rainfall in a day was also indicated by
   statistical analysis for both stations. Southwest monsoon precipitation
   in Delhi was found directly related to Scandinavian Pattern and East
   Atlantic/West Russia and inversely related to Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation, whereas precipitation in Mumbai was found inversely related
   to Indian ocean dipole, El Nio- Southern Oscillation and East Atlantic
   Pattern.},

Abstract = {The environmental implications of rainfall pattern in replenishment of
   ground water system of Saharanpur region, located in western Uttar
   Pradesh, have been discussed. The mathematical analysis of rainfall
   dissimilarity of Saharanpur region for a period of 50 year (1959 to
   2008) display a quite good range from 497.70 to 4357.5 mm with an annual
   average rainfall value of 1209.8 mm. The positive trend of departure
   from the computer value of average annual rainfall exhibits appropriate
   periods for recharge of ground water reservoir. The recorded data of
   annual rainfall during the last 3 year reveal values below the
   calculated annual average rainfall, pointing out negative trend. The
   statistical analysis of rainfall data involves computations of various
   statistical parameters, which also support the negative trend of
   rainfall. The prediction of expected future rainfall trend for a period
   up to 2018 has been made, which indicates a negative trend. The proposal
   have been incorporated to implement a plan for augmentation of ground
   water resource and also to develop possibilities of rainwater
   harvesting.},

Abstract = {In this study, long-term annual and monthly trends in rainfall amount,
   number of rainy days and maximum precipitation in 24 h are investigated
   based on the data collected at 33 synoptic stations in Iran. The
   statistical significance of trend and climate variability is assessed by
   the Mann-Kendall test. The Linear trend analysis and the Mann-Kendall
   test indicate that there are no significant linear trends in monthly
   rainfall at most of the synoptic stations in Iran. However, the maximum
   number of stations with negative trends have been observed in April (29
   station), and then in May (21 stations) and February (21 stations) and
   with positive trends in December (26 stations) and July (24 stations).
   The significant linear trends, with a significant level of 0.05, in
   annual rainfall have been noticed only at five stations. The monthly
   number of rainy days does not show any significant linear trend for most
   areas in Iran. The maximum number of stations with monthly negative
   trends in rainy days has also been observed in April with the minimum in
   December. In April, out of 24 stations with negative trends, 12 stations
   have a significant negative trend. Contrary to that, in October there is
   no significant linear trend. Most stations have positive trends in
   annual number of rainy days. Also, the monthly maximum precipitation in
   24 h does not show any significant linear trend for most areas in Iran.
   The maximum number of stations with monthly negative trends in maximum
   precipitation has also been observed in February with the minimum in
   December. In spite of that, there are almost no significant
   precipitation variations in Iran during the last 50-odd years, the
   tendency of decreasing rainfall amount in April and increasing rainfall
   amount in December and July could indicate an eventual climate change in
   this area in the future.},

Abstract = {There is the need to evaluate changes in the spatial and temporal
   patterns of rainfall in order to improve water management strategies of
   a given region. In this study, standard tests are used to examine the
   existence of trend in annual and monthly rainfall of Nigeria over the
   last century. Rainfall variability index was estimated as standardized
   rainfall departure while autocorrelation spectral analysis is used to
   obtain the periodicities inherent therein. Rainfall spatial distribution
   was highly latitudinal dependent (r(2) > 0.90) and had no clearly linear
   relations with the longitude. Rainfall variability index showed that
   1950s was the wettest decade (+0.84) while 1980s was the driest (-1.19),
   with the two decades between 1970 and 1990 being drier than any other
   comparable period in the last century. Observed rainfall changes varied
   between -3.46 and +0.76 mm yr(-2). About 90\% of the entire landscape
   exhibited negative trends but only 22\% showed significant changes at
   5\% level. There was a sharp difference between changes in rainfalls in
   1931-1960 and 1961-1990 periods. Annual precipitation reduced by 7\%
   between the two periods. While more than 90\% of the landscape showed no
   significant rainfall change in the first period, about 57\% of Nigeria
   showed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the second. The dominant
   peaks can be classified into four distinct rainfall cycles with periods
   2-3, 5-7, 10-15 and 30 yr. These cycles may be associated with the
   stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), the El-Nino Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO); the sunspot cycles and the Atlantic Multi-Decadal
   Oscillation (AMO) sea surface temperature, respectively. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Semantic difference s have led to a gap in the understanding of the
   impacts of climate change on precipitation frequency estimates. There is
   popular perception that heavy rainfalls have become more frequent, and
   that this trend will increase with global warming. Most of the
   literature examines this question from the point of view of climatology
   using definitions of ``heavy,'' ``very heavy,'' or ``extreme'' rainfall,
   which are different from those commonly used by civil engineers. This
   article identifies the differences in meaning used by the climate and
   civil engineering communities and examines trends in the observed record
   in the frequency of exceedances ( not trends in magnitudes). Using
   concepts recognized as the basis for design of the Nation's civil
   infrastructure, we look at trends in the number of exceedances of
   thresholds for a variety of precipitation frequencies and event
   durations used by civil engineers. We found that the estimated trends in
   exceedances at one-day and multiday durations were statistically
   significant and increasing for the Ohio River Basin and surrounding
   states but the reverse was true for the Semiarid Southwest (i.e., not
   significant and decreasing trends). In addition, we found the magnitude
   of the trends was small for all but the more frequent events and also
   small with respect to the uncertainty associated with the precipitation
   frequency estimates themselves.},

   a dense network of 1128 raingauge stations in Andhra Pradesh. No
   decreasing trend is noticed over the entire state with grid data.
   However, a clear decreasing trend in annual rainfall is found in the
   tract consisting of Medak, Nalgonda, Krishna, East and West Godavari
   districts from block level data. On the contrary, increasing trend is
   noticed with grid data;in these districts. In Prakasam district,
   declining, trend in many blocks with block level data was noticed, but
   increasing trend is seen with grid data Like wise in Rayalaseema
   (Anantapur, Cuddapah, and Chittor) some blocks are showing increasing or

Abstract = {Stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) series were developed from analysis
   of sequential radial wood increments from AD 1850 to AD 2009 for four
   mature primary rainforest trees from the Danum and Imbak areas of Sabah,
   Malaysia. The aseasonal equatorial climate meant that conventional
   dendrochronology was not possible as the tree species investigated do
   not exhibit clear annual rings or dateable growth bands. Chronology was
   established using radiocarbon dating to model age-growth relationships
   and date the carbon isotopic series from which the intrinsic water-use
   efficiency (IWUE) was calculated. The two Eusideroxylon zwageri trees
   from Imbak yielded ages of their pith/central wood (+/-1 sigma) of
   670+/-40 and 759+/-40 years old; the less dense Shorea johorensis and
   Shorea superba trees at Danum yielded ages of 240+/-40 and 330+/-40
   years, respectively. All trees studied exhibit an increase in the IWUE
   since AD 1960. This reflects, in part, a response of the forest to
   increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Unlike studies of
   some northern European trees, no clear plateau in this response was
   observed. A change in the IWUE implies an associated modification of the
   local carbon and/or hydrological cycles. To resolve these uncertainties,
   a shift in emphasis away from high-resolution studies towards long,
   well-replicated time series is proposed to develop the environmental
   data essential for model evaluation. Identification of old (greater than
   700 years) ringless trees demonstrates their potential in assessing the
   impacts of climatic and atmospheric change. It also shows the scientific
   and applied value of a conservation policy that ensures the survival of
   primary forest containing particularly old trees (as in Imbak Canyon and
   Danum).},

Abstract = {Satellite communications using millimetre waves, in Ka band and above,
   experience significant fading by rain. Strong attenuation is experienced
   between the ground station and a level known as the rain height, in
   ITU-R recommendations assumed to be 360 m above the zero-degree isotherm
   (ZDI). This study examines National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration National Centres for Environmental Prediction
   (NCEP)/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis 1 data
   to identify changes in the ZDI height over the last 30 years. Near the
   equator and the poles the ZDI height has been approximately stable over
   this period. However, in mid-latitudes, different regions show trends of
   increasing or decreasing ZDI height. Over the economically important
   regions of North America, China and Western Europe, the ZDI height has
   shown an increasing trend with peak rates in the range of 8-10 m per
   year. Given a 20-year life-time of a satellite system, this could lead
   to a 10-20\% increase in fade intensity from a similar rain event. The
   effect will be compounded by increasing trends in the incidence of heavy
   rain recently identified in UK data. These trends will need to be
   considered when designing new systems.},

Title = {Investigating: common trends of annual maximum rainfalls during heavy

Abstract = {Typhoons or heavy rainfall events account for a significant portion of
   annual extreme rainfall in southern Taiwan. This study built a dynamic
   time series model for long duration extreme rainfalls to investigate
   common trends in annual maximum precipitation. The annual maximum
   rainfall depths for 24-h duration (AM24 h) and annual maximum rainfall
   depths for 1-h duration (AM1 h) of the same event were observed at 16
   rainfall stations in the Kaoping River watershed, Southern Taiwan. The
   relationship between short and long duration observations is difficult
   to directly evaluate from comparative statistical techniques. Dynamic
   factor analysis (DFA, a dimension reduction technique and can be adopted
   for analysis of non-stationary time series) was therefore used to
   identify underlying common trends of AM24 h time series and significant
   explanatory variables (AM1 h) contributing to variations of AM24 h. The
   results of best dynamic factor models (DFMs) show that the AM1 h of
   nearby rainfall stations at both high elevation (coefficient of
   efficiency, C-eff = 0.924) and low elevation (C-eff = 0.909)
   successfully describe the AM24 h in the Kaoping River watershed. The AM1
   h observed at high elevation, close to the study area center
   significantly relates to the AM24 h of most rainfall stations. The
   common trends of extreme precipitation at most stations are upward in
   the Kaoping River watershed. Due to this successful application of DFA,
   predicting AM24 h in the Kaoping River watershed should account for the
   dominant rainfall stations with annual maximum rainfalls for short
   durations, to provide important information to determine precipitation
   trends for long-term planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Short-duration rainfall data are key inputs for design of stormwater
   infrastructure. To address concerns raised regarding the validity of
   relations based on these data, 13 Canadian climate stations were
   selected: one station for each province and territory, having a
   ``long{''} record length (27 to 63 years), minimal missing years and
   potential significance for urban infrastructure design. For each
   station, a state-of-practice time series analysis was completed for the
   nine intensity duration frequency (IDF) durations (5 min - 24 h) to
   identify non-stationarities in the form of trends or jumps.
   Approximately, 30\% of the time series showed statistically significant
   trends or jumps. Data sets not satisfying the stationarity criterion
   should be critically reviewed before computed quantiles are applied for
   design. Arbitrary split sample analysis was investigated as an
   alternative method for identifying non-stationarities and was found to
   be an unreliable indicator of significant changes.},

Abstract = {The evolution of seasonal cycle and interannual rainfall, the number of
   rainy days and daily rainfall types, dry spells frequency of occurrence,
   onset/cessation/length of rainy season, sowing dates, and the duration
   of the cropping period, are investigated at local (individual sites) and
   sub-regional scales (four different rainfall zones) using daily records
   of station data (83 sites) over Senegal. In the limits of a case study,
   these analyses complement and update previous studies conducted in the
   extreme Western Sahel (11-16A degrees N and 20A degrees W-10A degrees
   E). The results unveil noticeable evolution of some of these rain-based
   factors in the recent periods as compared to the previous dry years. In
   the regions recording less than 800 mm/year (Sudan and Sahel
   sub-regions), the positive and statistically significant trends of
   rainfall amount are associated with new features of increasing frequency
   of short dry spell category, increasing number of some classes of
   extreme daily rainfall amounts and shifts in the peak number of rainy
   days. At sub-regional scales, the starting years (or change points) the
   magnitude and the signs of the new trends are unevenly distributed in
   the period post-1990. Earlier and higher amplitude changes are found at
   local scales and not less than one third of the sites in each
   sub-regional network are significantly affected. The extreme Southern
   sub-region exhibits no significant changes. Statistically significant
   trends are not observed on daily rain records a parts per thousand
   currency sign10 mm, onset/cessation dates, successful sowing dates,
   rainy season length, cropping period, medium and extreme dry spell
   categories. Rather, some of these factors such as the successful sowing
   date and the cropping season length exhibit significant variability. The
   onset (cessation) dates of the rainy season are followed (preceded) by
   extreme dry spell episodes. In the perspectives of climate impact
   assessments on the local agriculture a sub-regional periodic synopsis of
   the major rain-based factors of interest to agricultural applications
   are provided at the end the paper. They document some important internal
   variability patterns to reckon with in a multi-decadal work over the
   1950-2008 period for this region.},

Abstract = {Analyzing alterations in water availability due to natural climatic
   variability and climate change is important in developing adaptive
   responses to current and future changes in regional precipitation
   patterns. In order to understand these changes, spatial and temporal
   historic fluctuations in regional rainfall patterns must be analyzed. In
   this context, precipitation trends were analyzed using a non-parametric
   statistic Mann-Kendall test for annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall
   between 1975 and 2006 for 108 precipitation ground stations located in
   the upper and middle Cauca river basin. The results demonstrate that the
   significant trend of annual rainfall variation was between -9.3\%
   (-147,3mm) and +6.5\% (+128mm) per decade and the average change was
   -0.7\% per decade for 24 stations. In the seasonal intra-annual analysis
   of June-July-August, a period of lower intra-annual rainfall, we found
   the largest statistically significant decrease in seasonal rainfall,
   with an average of -15\% per decade, in 19\% (21) of the total stations.
   The conclusions are that the pattern of seasonal precipitation changed
   between 1975 and 2006 and before to compare the annual rainfall trends
   with geographic variables (latitude, longitude and altitude), we found
   that rainfall had decreased in all cases above 1500 m in altitude and in
   latitudes lower than 3 degrees 52'N within the Andean Mountains. These
   changes in precipitation will decrease the volume and availability of
   runoff, which will alter the water availability in the river basin. In
   order to design adaptation practices in future investigations, is
   necessary to study daily rainfall changes and its impacts on the
   inhabitants of the Cauca river basin.},

   detected no important climate trend within the PRE series. However,
   during the end of the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season

Title = {The biogeochemistry of arsenic in a remote UK upland site: trends in
   rainfall and runoff, and comparisons with urban rivers},

Abstract = {Ten years of monitoring of rainfall and streams in the remote acidic and
   acid sensitive moorland and afforested moorland of upland mid-Wales
   reveals concentrations of arsenic (As) typically < 1 mu g L(-1). On
   average, the lowest concentrations occur within rainfall and they have
   declined over time probably in response to reductions in global
   emissions. There is a corresponding reduction within the streams except
   for forested systems where concentrations up to doubled following
   clear-fell. Within the streams there are both annual cycling and diurnal
   cycling of As. The annual cycling gives maxima during the summer months
   and this probably reflects the importance of groundwater inputs and
   mineralisation/desorption from the surface soil layers. Correspondingly,
   the diurnal cycling occurs during the summer months at low flow periods
   with As concentrations highest in the afternoon/evening. For the
   urban/industrial basins of northern England with historically a much
   higher As deposition, land contamination and effluent discharges,
   comparative data indicate As concentrations around three fold higher:
   strong seasonal patterns are observed for the same reasons as with the
   uplands. Across the sites, the As concentrations are over an order of
   magnitude lower than that of environmental concern. Nonetheless, the
   results clearly show the effects of declining emissions on rainfall
   deposition and some indication of areas of historic contamination.
   Arsenic is mainly present in the < 0.45 fraction, but cross-flow
   filtration indicates that approx. 43\% is in the colloidal phase at the
   clean water sites, and 16\% in the colloidal phase at the contaminated
   sites. Part of this colloidal component may well be associated with
   organic carbon.},

Title = {Analysis of weekly rainfall of different period during rainy season over
   Safdarjung airport of Delhi for 20<SUP>th</SUP> century - A study on
   trend, decile and decadal analysis},
Journal = {MAUSAM},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The analysis of weekly rainfall and of different period during rainy
   season of Safdarjang airport using techniques like trend and decile have
   been attempted. Decadal analysis is also attempted to see any changes
   during the entire period. Rainy season is defined as rainfall received
   from week no. 23(rd) to 38(th). Weekly rainfall data for period 1901 to
   2000 is utilized for this location. As week is a shorter period to
   analyze rainfall for the season groups of different periods consisting
   of 4 weeks such as 1-4 as `A', 5-8 as `B' and so on up to `D' is formed.
   For study of progressive season combination of groups such as `A+B',
   A+B+C and `A+B+C+D' are also subjected to analysis as done for weekly as
   well for group.
   The average weekly rainfall distribution indicates very high positive
   value of coefficient of correlation (0.94) significant at 1\% level. The
   coefficient variation (C.V.) of weekly average rainfall shows
   consistency from decade 5(th) to 8(th) and 10(th). Profile of average
   C.V. of weekly rainfall for 100 years shows consistency from week 4 to
   11. Week no. 8 shows peak of rainfall. Overall decile analysis of weekly
   rainfall shows increasing tendency from week no. 1 to 8 for all deciles
   and then decreasing tendency from week no. 9 on words for all decile
   values. Trend analysis of group `C' shows significant positive tendency
   with correlation as +0.20 significant at 5\% level. However trend
   analysis of deciles of all groups shows very high C.C. around +0.95 at
   1\% level. Trend analysis of combination of groups shows positive trend
   for A+B+C and for A+B+C+D with a C.C. of 0.25 and 0.20 at 5\% level.
   Trend of deciles for these groups also shows very high C.C. values
   around +0.95 at 1\% level. Average, excess and deficient rainfall seen
   at Safdarjung airport is 5(th), 7(th) and 4(th) decile with values as
   594, 708 and 472 mm respectively. Analysis of two halves of century,
   viz., 1901-50 and 1951-2000 shows no significant trend.},

Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {656-667},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall trends from 1961 to 2006 period
   were analysed in this study by applying various statistical tools to
   data from 553 Spanish weather stations. The magnitude of the trends was
   derived from the slopes of the regression lines using the least squares
   method, while the statistical significance was determined using the
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. Geostatistical interpolation
   techniques were applied to generate rainfall trend surfaces. Combining
   classic trends tests and spatially interpolated precipitation permits
   the spatio-temporal visualization of detected trends. Updated trends
   reveal that rainfall is generally decreasing in January, February,
   March, April, and June. Around 61, 44 and 12\% of the whole territory is
   evidencing significant negative trends in February, June and March,
   respectively. Significant precipitation decreases are also noted in more
   than 28\% of Spain in summer and winter. On the contrary, rainfall is
   significantly increasing in October in more than 21\% of Spain and areas
   mainly located in north-western areas. May, August, September and autumn
   also show significant positive trends in the period 1961-2006, although
   the percentages are lower than for negative trends. Finally, the annual
   precipitation is significantly decreasing in 11\% of the territory.

Title = {Aquatic Microbial Habitats Within a Neotropical Rainforest: Bromeliads
   and pH-Associated Trends in Bacterial Diversity and Composition},
Journal = {MICROBIAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {529-542},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Tank-forming bromeliads, suspended in the rainforest canopy, possess
   foliage arranged in compact rosettes capable of long-term retention of
   rainwater. This large and unique aquatic habitat is inhabited by
   microorganisms involved in the important decomposition of impounded
   material. Moreover, these communities are likely influenced by
   environmental factors such as pH, oxygen, and light. Bacterial community
   composition and diversity was determined for the tanks of several
   bromeliad species (Aechmea and Werauhia) from northern Costa Rica, which
   span a range of parameters, including tank morphology and pH. These were
   compared with a nearby forest soil sample, an artificial tank (amber
   bottle), and a commercially available species (Aechmea). Bacterial
   community diversity, as measured by 16S rRNA analysis and tRFLP, showed
   a significant positive correlation with tank pH. A majority of 16S rRNA
   bacterial phylotypes found in association with acidic bromeliad tanks of
   pH < 5.1 were affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria,
   Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes, and were similar to those found in
   acidic peat bogs, yet distinct from the underlying soil community. In
   contrast, bromeliads with tank pH > 5.3, including the commercial
   bromeliad with the highest pH (6.7), were dominated by
   Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. To empirically
   determine the effect of pH on bacterial community, the tank pH of a
   specimen of Aechmea was depressed, in the field, from 6.5 to 4.5, for 62
   days. The resulting community changed predictably with decreased
   abundance of Betaproteobacteria and Firmicutes and a concomitant
   increase in Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Collectively, these
   results suggest that bromeliad tanks provide important habitats for a
   diverse microbial community, distinct from the surrounding environment,
   which are influenced greatly by acid-base conditions. Additionally,
   total organic carbon (similar to 46\%) and nitrogen (similar to 2\%) of
   bromeliad-impounded sediment was elevated relative to soil and gene
   surveys confirmed the presence of both chitinases and nitrogenases,
   suggesting that bromeliad tanks may provide important habitats for
   microbes involved in the biological cycling of carbon and nitrogen in
   tropical forests.},

Title = {Trend and spectral analysis of rainfall over India during 1901-2000},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {The spectral analysis of gridded rainfall data obtained from 1384 rain
   gauge stations by India Meteorological Department demonstrates not much
   change in low-frequency components of decadal spectra of all India and
   its four subregions, namely, southwest, southeast, central, and
   northwest, during the last 10 decades. However, the dominant as well as
   the significant cycles lying between the periods 10-20 days, 20-30 days,
   30-40 days, and 40-50 days are highly variable on an interdecadal basis.
   On close inspection, it can be inferred that the 40-50 day oscillations
   that corresponds to Madden-Julian Oscillations is mainly associated with
   the southern Indian region, namely southwest and southeast, and the
   30-40 day oscillation of southeast region is gradually increasing on a
   decadal scale during the last 4 decades. The physical context of
   interdecadal variability of rainfall in India can be linked with the
   warm phase of Atlantic multidecadal oscillations and the cold phase of
   interdecadal Pacific oscillations. The correlogram analysis shows the
   presence of 15, (17, 19), and 17 year cycles for the southwest, central,
   and northwest regions, respectively. No significant trend is discernable
   during the last 10 decades, when the linear least squares fitting method
   and Mann-Kendall statistic to identify the trend and the normalized test
   statistic and statistical probability to quantify the significance of
   the trend are applied, on the annual rainfall data for all India and its
   subregions.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {67-82},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This paper analyzes hourly rainfall data from a collection of tipping
   bucket rain gauges in British Columbia. Me hourly rainfall data are used
   to define peaks over threshold (POT) rainfall events for durations of 1,
   2, 6, 12 and 24 hours. This database is then used to define, on an
   annual basis, the number of over threshold events, the average magnitude
   of the over threshold events, and the largest over threshold event.
   Trend analysis is conducted for these three variables for each duration
   and for several common analysis periods drawn from the period 1966 to
   2005. The identification and estimation of trends is conducted using the
   Mann-Kendall nonparametric test for trend. The global, or field,
   significance of the trend results is established using a bootstrap
   resampling approach. The research reveals generally increasing trends in
   extreme rainfall, especially for the summer season and for the short
   duration rainfall events.},

Abstract = {An original approach is proposed to estimate the impacts of climate
   change on extreme events using an hourly rainfall stochastic generator.
   The considered generator relies on three parameters. These parameters
   are estimated by average, not by extreme, values of daily climatic
   characteristics. Since climate changes should result in parameters
   instability in time, the paper focuses on testing the presence of linear
   trends in the generator parameters. Maximum likelihood tests are used
   under a Poisson-Pareto-Peak-Over-Threshold model. A general
   regionalization procedure is also proposed which offers the possibility
   to work on both local and regional scales. From the daily information of
   139 rain gauge stations between 1960 and 2003, changes in heavy
   precipitations in France and their impacts on quantile predictions are
   investigated. It appears that significant changes occur mainly between
   December and May for the rainfall occurrence which increased during the
   four last decades, except in the Mediterranean area. Using the trend
   estimates, one can deduced that these changes, up to now, do not affect
   quantile estimations.},

Title = {Analysis of trends in the Sahelian `rain-use efficiency' using GIMMS

Abstract = {Rain-use efficiency (RUE; the ratio of vegetation productivity to annual
   precipitation) has been suggested as a measure for assessing land
   degradation in arid/semi-arid areas. In the absence of anthropogenic
   influence. RUE has been reported to be constant over time, and any
   observed change may therefore be attributed to non-rainfall impacts.
   This study presents an analysis of the decadal time-scale changes in the
   relationship between a proxy for vegetation productivity (Sigma NDVI)
   and annual rainfall in the Sahel-Sudanian zone of Africa. The aim is to
   test the quality of data input and the usefulness of both the RUE
   approach and an alternative method for separating the effects on
   vegetation productivity of rainfall change and human impact. The
   analyses are based on earth observation of both rainfall (GPCP (Global
   Precipitation Climatology Project), 1982-2007 and RFE (Rainfall
   Estimate) (1996-2007)) and Sigma NDVI (AVHRR GIMMS NDVI dataset,
   1982-2007). It is shown that the increase in Sigma NDVI has been
   substantial in the Sahel-Sudanian zone over the 1982-2007 period,
   whereas for the period 1996-2007 the pattern of Sigma NDVI trends is
   more complex. Also, trend analysis of annual rainfall from GPCP data
   (2.5 degrees resolution) and RFE data (0.1 degrees resolution) suggests
   that rainfall has increased over both periods. Further it is shown that
   RUE values are highly correlated to rainfall, undermining the use of
   earth observation (EO)-based RUE (using Sigma NDVI) as a means of
   separating rainfall impacts from other factors. An alternative method
   identify temporal trends in residuals of Sigma NDVI, after regressing it
   against annual rainfall, is tested, yet is shown to be useful only where
   a high correlation between Sigma NDVI and annual rainfall exists. For
   the areas in the Sahel-Sudanian zone for which this condition is
   fulfilled, trend analyses suggest very limited anthropogenic land
   degradation in the Sahel-Sudanian zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {A peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach is used to study trends in extreme
   rainfall over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) at a daily scale. Records from
   52 observatories regularly distributed over Iberia with no missing data
   were available for the common period from 1958 to 2004. The POT approach
   was used because it is particularly effective at extracting information
   concerning true extreme events. A generalized Pareto distribution fit
   was made to the data involving time-dependent parameters to account for
   possible temporal changes in the frequency distribution. These
   parameters were analyzed for trends in the return-level period, of
   importance for engineering purposes. A time-varying threshold was
   defined and an automatic declustering scheme was used to select
   independent extreme events exceeding the threshold. The results indicate
   a high variability of extreme events over the coastline of the IP,
   greater over the Mediterranean coast than over the Atlantic coast. The
   calculation of the trends for the 2-yr return level yielded a large
   proportion of negative trends for all three seasons considered: 58\% for
   winter, 63\% for spring, and 69\% for autumn. The parametric approach
   also revealed an increase in the area with a positive trend of the 20-yr
   return level relative to the 2-yr return period, especially in autumn in
   the east of the IP.},

Abstract = {In order to investigate the behaviour of climatic and hydrological
   variables, several statistical and stochastic techniques are currently
   applied to time series. In the present study a statistical analysis of
   annual and seasonal precipitation has been performed over 109 cumulated
   rainfall series with more than 50 years of data observed in a region of
   Southern Italy (Calabria). Trend analyses have been made by using both
   nonparametric (Mann-Kendall test) and parametric (linear regression
   analysis) procedures. The long historical series of monthly rainfall
   data employed in this work have been previously processed through a
   pre-whitening (PW) technique in order to reduce the autocorrelation of
   rainfall series and its effects on outcomes of trend detection. The
   application of the above mentioned procedures has shown a decreasing
   trend for annual and winter-autumn rainfall and an increasing trend for
   summer precipitation. Moreover the Mann-Whitney test has been used to
   evidence the possible change points in the data. The higher percentages
   of rainfall series show possible year changes during decade 1960-1970
   for almost all of the temporal aggregation rainfall. Copyright (C) 2009

Abstract = {General Circulation Models (GCMs) are our best tool for assessing
   potential changes to our climate on a global scale into the future.
   However, certain physical processes that influence rainfall at any
   particular location operate at finer spatial scales than can be
   simulated by GCMs. Dynamical downscaling using regional climate models
   (RCMs) addresses this problem by simulating the relevant processes at
   finer scales, whilst retaining the important large-scale features of the
   original GCM. Assessment of the RCM simulations is an essential task
   before using them as a guide for potential future rainfall trends.
   Assessing the outputs of models both in terms of their simulation of
   relevant output variables (e. g. rainfall) and also the dynamics gives a
   more comprehensive assessment than examining the variables alone.
   Similarly, understanding the dynamics driving the projected trends from
   the model simulation can be used to gauge the plausibility of that
   projected trend.
   Here we present dynamically downscaled simulations of rainfall over the
   study site of Tasmania, Australia (similar to 10 km grid scale). These
   fine-scale projections were produced using a dynamical downscaling
   regional climate model. Rainfall in the simulations is validated against
   a gridded climate dataset based on observations, and the model
   simulation of broad climate fields such as mean pressure and wind fields
   were assessed by comparison to reanalysis datasets. Additionally, the
   projected rainfall trends are interpreted in terms of known climate
   drivers.
   While GCM projections to 2100 show fairly uniform rainfall trends over
   all of Tasmania, the RCM projections reveal distinct trends in the
   different districts of Tasmania. The spatial pattern of rainfall changes
   also varies greatly in each season. The change in each district is
   driven by a unique combination of drivers and processes. The main
   climate drivers of change include the alteration to mean circulation in
   response to surface warming, changes to the strength and position of the
   subtropical ridge, shifts in atmospheric blocking, the southern annular
   mode, as well as changes to the synoptic climatology of significant
   systems. At a scale relevant to Tasmania the climate response to these
   processes is often poorly resolved in GCM simulations, and is improved
   through regional modelling. In this paper we present a holistic view of
   rainfall changes over Tasmania, linking large-scale drivers and finer
   scale processes to spatial and temporal changes in rainfall. Such
   analyses are only possible with fine-scale dynamical downscaling. We
   conclude that including new information from increased resolution using
   fine-scale dynamical downscaling provides more useful projections of
   rainfall changes at a local scale. We propose that analysis of the
   relevant rainfall mechanisms also helps to assess the confidence in
   which the climate simulations should be used as a tool for understanding
   future changes in rainfall.},

   There is an increasing trend in minimum and maximum temperatures but no
   trend in annual rainfall. The slope of regression line for annual
   rainfall was negative at Bajaura and positive at Katrain but both were
   non significant. The coefficient of variation for annual rainfall (22
   \%) and for monsoon rainfall (33 \%) was showing the consistence of
   annual and southwest monsoon rainfall but, a shifting of monsoon from
   its wettest months was observed. The rainfall was most variable during
   post monsoon season at Bajaura and in winter at Katrain. The decreasing
   rate in rainfall was higher during the recent period than the decadal
   period. Monthly, seasonal and annual average minimum temperature was
   showing decreasing trend at Bajaura and an increasing trend at Katrain,
   but, maximum temperature is increasing at both the stations. The minimum
   temperature was most variable during the winter season whereas the
   maximum temperature was during summer. Higher the altitude higher the
   variability in minimum temperature but lower the altitude higher the
   variability in maximum temperature. Both maximum and minimum
   temperatures were showing a higher rate of increasing during the recent

Abstract = {The main aim of this work is to evaluate the development of
   rainfall-runoff regime in selected river basins of the Sumava Mountains
   (Bohemian Forest), the Jeseniky Mountains and the Krugne Mountains (Ore
   Mountains) in the last 50 years. Besides the identification of
   inhomogeneity in time series of mean discharges, rainfall amounts,
   temperature and snow cover data, the work deals with an analysis of
   trends using annual and monthly data. Different methodological tools for
   identification of changes and trends in hydro-climatic time series have
   been introduced in this study, especially different methods of statistic
   testing and an application of Mann-Kendall seasonal test. The results
   have been compared not only from the point of view of the methods
   applied here, but as well from the viewpoint of geographical difference
   of the mentioned areas.},

Abstract = {This study aims to determine trends in annual and seasonal rainfall and
   rainy days over different river basins across India. The data used
   consists of daily gridded rainfall at 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution
   for the period 1951-2004. Sen's non-parametric estimator of slope was
   used to estimate the magnitude of trend whose statistical significance
   was assessed by the Mann-Kendall test. Among 22 basins studied, 15
   showed a decreasing trend in annual rainfall; only one basin showed a
   significant decreasing trend at 95\% confidence level. Of the 6 basins
   showing an increasing trend, 1 basin showed a significant positive
   trend. The monsoon rainfall increased over 6 basins, decreased over 16
   basins and a decreasing trend for 2 basins was found statistical
   significant. With the exception of Ganga, Brahmaputra and EFR4, all
   river basins experienced the same direction of trend in monsoon and
   annual rainfall. Four river basins experienced increasing
   (non-significant) trend in annual rainy days; three basins did not show
   any change in annual rainy days whereas 15 basins have shown a
   decreasing trend in annual rainy days. The decreasing trend in three
   basins was statistically significant. Most of the basins have shown the
   same direction of trend in rainfall and rainy days at the annual and
   seasonal scale.},

Abstract = {The monsoon season (June-September) is the major source of rainwater in
   all the meteorological subdivisions of India, except the Tamil Nadu \&
   Pondicherry sub-division. In this study, the observed trends in monsoon
   rainfall, monthly as well as seasonal, were investigated and compared,
   and the variability and frequency of extreme excess and deficit rainfall
   during 1871-2008 were also analysed. The magnitude of a trend was
   estimated using Sen's slope method. The trend results, using the
   Mann-Kendall and Spearman's Rho trend tests, were similar for all the 30
   meteorological sub-divisions of India, as well as for the Indian region,
   for monsoon months and for the monsoon season. In the majority of
   sub-divisions, a decreasing trend of monsoon rainfall during the study
   period was found. The decadal trends in frequency and the spatial
   variability of occurrence of extreme excess/deficit rainfall years were
   also investigated. The results show that the decadal occurrence of
   number of extreme excess rainfall years over the eastern coastal
   sub-divisions has an increasing trend, while 17 sub-divisions show
   decreasing trend. However, the occurrence of total extreme deficit
   rainfall years shows an increasing trend over the eastern and peninsular
   sub-divisions, except for Kerala and Gangetic West Bengal.},

Abstract = {Most of the water from the Nile originates in Ethiopia but there is no
   agreement on how land degradation or climate change affects the future
   flow in downstream countries. The objective of this paper is to improve
   the understanding of future conditions by analysing historical trends.
   During the period 1964-2003, the average monthly basin-wide
   precipitation and monthly discharge data were collected and analysed
   statistically for two stations in the upper 30\% of the Blue Nile Basin
   and monthly and 10-day discharge data of one station at the
   Sudan-Ethiopia border. A rainfall-runoff model examined the causes for
   observed trends. The results show that, while there was no significant
   trend in the seasonal and annual basin-wide average rainfall,
   significant increases in discharge during the long rainy season (June to
   September) were observed at all three stations. In the upper Blue Nile,
   the short rainy season flow (March to May) increased, while the dry
   season flow (October to February) stayed the same. At the Sudan border,
   the dry season flow decreased significantly with no change in the short
   rainy season flow. The difference in response was likely due to the
   construction of weir in the 1990s at the Lake Tana outlet that affected
   the upper Blue Nile discharge significantly but affected less than 10\%
   of the discharge at the Sudan border. The rainfall-runoff model
   reproduced the observed trends, assuming that an additional 10\% of the
   hillsides were eroded in the 40-year time span and generated overland
   flow instead of interflow and base flow. Models concerning future trends
   in the Nile cannot assume that the landscape runoff processes will
   remain static. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Rainfall variability is an important feature of semi-arid climates, and
   climate change is likely to increase that variability in many of these
   regions. An understanding of rainfall variability and trends in that
   variability is needed to help vulnerable dryland agriculturalists and
   policymakers address current climate variation and future climate
   change. The goals of this paper are to examine this climatic phenomenon
   in semi-arid Botswana, to investigate these results for signs of climate
   change, and to explore the policy implications for climate adaptation.
   To reach these goals, the paper determines rainfall variability and
   monthly and annual trends in that variability. The results agree with
   earlier work showing gradients in rainfall and rainfall variability
   across Botswana. The results also identify a trend towards decreased
   rainfall throughout the nation, which is associated with decreases in
   the number of rainy days. Both the drying trend and decrease in rainy
   days agree with climate change projections for southern Africa. The
   paper discusses policies that the government could adopt to help its
   farmers adapt to climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Spatial patterns and trends of daily rainfall regime in Peninsular
   Malaysia during the southwest and northeast monsoons: 1975-2004},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {110},

Abstract = {This study focuses on describing the patterns and trends of five
   selected rainfall indices in Peninsular Malaysia, based on daily
   rainfall data from 1975 to 2004. Five rainfall indices based on two main
   seasons, the northeast and southwest monsoons, were analyzed: total
   rainfall, frequency of wet days, rainfall intensity, frequency of wet
   days (extreme frequency), and rainfall intensity (extreme intensity)
   exceeding the long-term mean 95th percentile. The findings indicated
   that the eastern areas of the Peninsula were strongly influenced by the
   northeast monsoon, while the southwest monsoon had the greatest impact
   on the western part of the Peninsula, particularly the northwest. In
   studying the trends of these rainfall indices, the non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall test was used. The serial correlation and cross-correlation
   structure of the data were accounted for in determining the significance
   of the Mann-Kendall test results. It was found that there were
   differences in trend patterns over the Peninsula during both seasons,
   with a decrease in total rainfall and a significant decrease in
   frequency of wet days leading to a significant increase in rainfall
   intensity over the Peninsula, except in eastern areas, during the
   southwest monsoon. In contrast, a trend of significantly increasing
   total rainfall and an increase in frequencies of extreme rainfall events
   during the northeast monsoon caused a significantly increasing trend in
   rainfall intensity over the Peninsula to be observed. However, no
   significant trend was observed with respect to extreme intensity during
   both monsoons over the Peninsula. The findings of this study suggest
   that rainfall patterns in Peninsular Malaysia are very much affected by
   the northeast monsoon, based on the larger magnitude of changes observed
   in the rainfall indices.},

Title = {Evaluating sampling error in TRMM/PR rainfall products by the bootstrap

Abstract = {This study examines a trend in the 7-year seasonal (i.e., trimonthly)
   rainfall amounts (September 2001 to August 2008) observed by the TRMM
   Precipitation Radar (PR). The PR-observed rainfall amounts averaged in
   the range of 36 degrees S to 36 degrees N tend to increase slightly over
   this period. This tendency can be caused not only by natural variations
   but also by sampling errors (random errors) due to the PR's sparse
   observations in time. To separate the natural variations from the
   sampling errors, we developed a method of evaluating the sampling errors
   by a bootstrap method using the actual data observed by the PR. This
   method enables an evaluation of regional difference and characteristics
   of the sampling error in 5 degrees grid boxes. As an application of the
   simulated sampling errors, we tested the significance of the trends in
   the averaged rainfall amounts by using Akaike's Information Criterion
   (AIC) and concluded that the positive trends were significant in all
   three cases; the trend in rainfall amounts averaged over all observed
   area (0.283 mm (3 months)(-2)), that over land (0.518 mm (3 months)(-2))
   and that over the ocean (0.208 mm (3 months)(-2)). We also tested the
   significance of the trends in the individual 5 degrees grid boxes during
   this period and found that regions with the largest trends correspond to
   those in which the earlier studies have found the precipitation patterns
   caused by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).},

Abstract = {The issue of climate change appears to be on the fore burner and it
   cannot be ascertained to occur without evidence. Rainfall is one of the
   climatic factors that can indicate climate change. In this work, the
   non-parametric Mann-Kendall test is used to test for significant trend
   in rainfall in Nigeria through randomly selected locations in the six
   geopolitical zones within a 30 years period (1978-2007). The selected
   locations are; Maiduguri (13 degrees 10', 11 degrees 50') in the North
   East, Kaduna (7 degrees 27', 10 degrees 31') in the North West, Lokoja
   (6 degrees 45', 7 degrees 43') in the North Central, Ibadan (3 degrees
   53', 7 degrees 22') in the South West, Enugu (7 degrees 30', 6 degrees
   27') in the South East and Calabar (8 degrees 28', 4 degrees 57') in the
   South South. During the 30 years period, the yearly average rainfalls
   (mm) were 580.5, 1187.5, 1228.7, 1317.2, 1753.8 and 2925.6,
   respectively. While the rest of the locations had no significant trend
   yet Maiduguri showed an increasing trend at a rate of 9.88 mm/year,
   where formally the trend there from the period 1961-1990 was decreasing.
   This change could either be a problem or blessing to dwellers in that
   location and there is need for continuous monitoring.},

Title = {Long-term rainfall monthly shortage in Spain: spatial patterns,
   statistical models and time trends},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {30},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1668-1688},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Several patterns of the monthly rainfall shortage in Spain are
   investigated by using long-term series of monthly rain amounts, which
   were recorded at 34 observatories and compiled by the Agencia Estatal de
   Meteorologia, AEMET (Spanish Ministry of Environment). Owing to the
   strong variability of the pluviometric regime along the year, the median
   of the empirical monthly rain amounts is estimated for every month of
   the year. A monthly shortage is then defined as the difference between
   the corresponding monthly median and the monthly rain amount. A spell of
   monthly shortage is a set of consecutive months with amounts below the
   corresponding monthly medians. Five magnitudes are defined to
   characterize the rainfall shortage: (1) the spell length, L (months);
   (2) the average monthly shortage of a spell, < S > (mm); (3) the largest
   monthly shortage in a spell, S-M (mm); (4) the total rainfall shortage
   for every spell, CS (mm) and (5) the rainfall amount for every shortage
   spell, CR. The whole number of spells, N, and the number of spells as a
   function of shortage lengths, N(L), are compared with those deduced from
   the distribution theory of runs (TR). Instead of a geometric
   distribution, a Markov chain of first order with two states becomes a
   better option for the probability density function of L. Although the
   empirical distributions of < S >, S-M and CS are well fitted by a
   Pearson-type III model for most gauges, the generalized Pareto (GP)
   distribution is sometimes a better choice. The distribution of CR is
   well fitted by gamma and especially Poisson-gamma models. Besides these
   statistical analyses, an interpretation of the rainfall shortage is
   attempted by looking for links between the distributions of cumulative
   monthly shortage (CMS), and cumulative number of months (CNM) with
   rainfall deficit. Both distributions generate normalized shortage curves
   (NSC), which follow similar laws to the normalized rainfall curves
   (NRC), used, for instance, in the study of daily rainfall amounts.
   Finally, statistical significance of local and field time trends of < S
   >, S-M and CS are evaluated. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological

Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present corroborative observational evidences from
   satellites, in-situ observations, and reanalysis data showing possible
   impacts of absorbing aerosols on subseasonal and regional summer monsoon
   rainfall over India. We find that increased absorbing aerosols in the
   Indo-Gangetic Plain in recent decades may have led to long-term warming
   of the upper troposphere over northern India and the Tibetan Plateau,
   enhanced rainfall in northern India and the Himalayas foothill regions
   in the early part (May-June) of the monsoon season, followed by
   diminished rainfall over central and southern Indian in the latter part
   (July-August) of the monsoon season. These signals, which are consistent
   with current theories of atmospheric heating and solar dimming by
   aerosol and induced cloudiness in modulating the Indian monsoon, would
   have been masked by conventional method of using all-India rainfall
   averaged over the entire monsoon season. Citation: Lau, W. K. M., and

Abstract = {Understanding the strategies that confer resilience on natural woodlands
   in drought prone environments is important for the conservation of these
   and similar ecosystems. Our main aim in this 2-year study was to assess
   traits (sapwood area, sapwood density and leaf area index) that control
   transpiration in Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. microcatpa in a natural
   forest in which topographical variation created surface soils of sandy
   clay in a depression (clay-zone) and of loamy sand underlain by a dense
   profile on the terraces (sand-zone). The clay-zone had a wetter profile
   due to extra water supply through subsurface lateral flow from the
   adjoining, topographically higher, sand-zone. In the clay-zone, the
   differences between the two tree species in their hydraulic attributes
   were large and rates of water use were widely divergent. Rates of
   transpiration per unit land area (E-c) and canopy conductance of E.
   camaldulensis that was dominant in the clay-zone were about 50\% lower
   than those for E. microcarpa in the same zone. This was in marked
   contrast to the behavior of trees growing in the sand-zone where water
   availability was persistently low and variations in sapwood density,
   sapwood area and canopy conductance were narrow. This resulted in almost
   identical rates of water use for the two species in the sand-zone,
   despite E. microcarpa dominating the stand. Contrary to many previous
   studies, sapwood density was positively correlated with E-c in these
   eucalypt species, while the proportion of trunk area assigned to sapwood
   declined with sapwood density. Consequently in this low rainfall
   environment, with prolonged dry seasons, dense sapwood safeguards
   against turgor loss, and possibly xylem embolism, thereby allowing E-c
   to be sustained under extremely low soil-water availability. We
   concluded that variation in hydraulic traits is less likely where trees
   are under persistent water-stress than where the stress is short and
   relatively mild. We developed single functions for predicting E-c for
   the two species by integrating their responses to micrometeorological
   and soil-water conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {Precipitation trend analysis, on different spatial and temporal scales,
   has been of great concern during the past century because of the
   attention given to global climate change by the scientific community.
   According to some recent studies, the Italian territory has been
   suffering a precipitation decrease, especially in the last 50 years, and
   the southern areas seem to be more affected. The aim of the present
   study is to analyse rainfall time series over a wide time interval and a
   wide area, detecting potential trends and assessing their significance.
   For this purpose, 211 gauged stations, mainly located within the
   Campania region, southern Italy, have been analysed for the period
   1918-1999. An accurate database has been set up through a data quality
   and time series homogeneity process. Statistical analysis of the
   database highlight that (1) the trend appears predominantly negative,
   both at the annual and seasonal scale, except for the summer period when
   it appears to be positive; (2) over the whole reference period, positive
   and negative trends are significant respectively for 9 and 27\% of total
   stations and (3) over the last 30 years, a negative trend is instead
   significant for 97\% of the total stations. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal

Title = {Trends in Peninsular Malaysia Rainfall Data During the Southwest Monsoon

Abstract = {This study investigated the spatial pattern and trends of the daily
   rainfall data in Peninsular Malaysia based on seasonal rainfall indices.
   Five rainfall indices which describe the main characteristics of
   rainfall, the total amount of rainfall, frequency of wet days, rainfall
   intensity, extreme frequency, and extreme intensity, were employed in
   this study. The statistics of rainfall indices were calculated in terms
   of their means for four regions in Peninsular Malaysia for the period
   1975 to 2004. The findings indicate that the southwest monsoon had the
   greatest impact on the western part of the Peninsula, particularly in
   characterizing the rainfall pattern of the northwest region. During this
   season, the northwest region could be considered as the wettest region
   since all rainfall indices tested are higher than in other regions of
   the Peninsula. Otherwise, the northwest region is denoted as the driest
   part of the Peninsula during the northeast monsoon period. The northwest
   region is less influenced by the northeast monsoon because of the
   existence of the Titiwangsa Range, which blocks the region from
   receiving heavy rainfall. On the other hand, it is found that the
   lowlands areas such as the eastern part of the Peninsula are strongly
   characterized by the northeast monsoonal flow. Based on the results of
   the Mann-Kendall test, as the trend of the total amount of rainfall and
   the frequency of wet days during the southwest monsoon decrease at most
   of the stations, the rainfall intensity increases. In contrast,
   increasing trends in both the total amount of rainfall and the frequency
   of wet days were observed at several stations during the northeast
   monsoon, which give rise to the increasing trend of rainfall intensity.
   The results for both seasons indicate that there are significantly
   decreasing trends in the frequency of wet days during the extreme events
   for most of the stations on the peninsula. However, a smaller number of
   significant trends was found for extreme intensity.},

Abstract = {We examine the role of rainfall trends in poor growth performance of
   sub-Saharan African nations relative to other developing countries,
   using a new cross-country panel climatic data set in an empirical

   significant determinant of poor economic growth for African nations but
   not for other countries. Depending on the benchmark measure of potential
   rainfall, we estimate that the direct impact under the scenario of no
   decline in rainfall would have resulted in a reduction of between around
   15\% and 40\% of today's gap in African GDP per capita relative to the
   rest of the developing world.},

Volume = {95},

Pages = {419-427},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Long-term rainfall variability in the Province of Cordoba, Argentina is
   studied. The methodology used was developed by Tome and Miranda (2004),
   and the most notable breakpoints in the time series were determined in
   order to identify sudden transitions from one period to another with a
   different linear trend sign. All the rain gauges operated by the
   ``Servicio Meteorologico Nacional{''} (SMN) of Argentina in Cordoba
   Province, in the period 1930-2006, were analyzed. One of the stations
   studied, Cordoba Observatorio, has reliable rainfall data since 1873. In
   this case, the 1925-2006 period and the 1873-2006 period were studied to
   analyze the influence of series length in terms of the piecewise linear
   trends produced.
   Analyzing only one breakpoint in all the series, a trend change is
   observed from negative to positive in the 1950s in the north area of the
   region, while in the other areas the opposite change occurs in the
   1970s.
   The residual sum of squares obtained with the partial trend method is
   compared to that produced by the traditional method. This comparison
   shows how the multiple trend method enables regional changes to be
   determined for a given climatological variable. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Trends in the incidence of rain rates associated with outages on fixed
   links operating above 10 GHz in the southern United Kingdom},
Journal = {RADIO SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {45},
Month = {FEB 23},
Abstract = {Studies have shown that climate change is leading to an increase in the
   incidence of heavy rain in the United Kingdom, particularly over winter.
   The major interest has been on the hydrological impacts of this
   increase, and so studies have focused on rain accumulations over hours
   or days and for large catchments. The availability of fixed, microwave
   links is limited by the incidence of heavy rain with an integration time
   of a minute or less. This document introduces evidence of an increasing
   trend in rain rates associated with outages. High-resolution rain data,
   produced by 30 tipping bucket gauges sited in the south of England, have
   been analyzed to identify these trends. The data span up to 20 years at
   each site. Increasing trends in the incidence of rain rates exceeded at
   annual time percentages between 0.005\% and 0.1\% are demonstrated. Data
   suggest that the total annual outage would have doubled or tripled over
   each decade analyzed for the majority of fixed links operating at rain
   fade limited frequencies. It is plausible that this trend could
   continue.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is the key climate variable that governs the spatial and
   temporal availability of water. In this study we identified monthly
   rainfall trends and their relation to the southern oscillation index
   (SOI) at ten rainfall stations across Australia covering all state
   capital cities. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used for
   identifying significant trends. The trend free pre-whitening approach
   (TFPW) was used to remove the effects of serial correlation in the
   dataset. The trend beginning year was approximated using the cumulative
   summation (CUSUM) technique and the influence of the SOI was identified
   using graphical representations of the wavelet power spectrum (WPS).
   Decreasing trends of rainfall depth were observed at two stations,
   namely Perth airport for June and July rainfall starting in the 1970s
   and Sydney Observatory Hill for July rainfall starting in the 1930s. No
   significant trends were found in the Melbourne, Alice Springs and
   Townsville rainfall data. The remaining five stations showed increasing
   trends of monthly rainfall depth. The SOI was found to explain the
   increasing trends for the Adelaide (June) and Cairns (April) rainfall
   data and the decreasing trends for Sydney (July) rainfall. Other
   possible climatic factors affecting Australian rainfall are also
   discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Direct or indirect anthropogenic effects on ecosystem nitrogen cycles
   are important components of global change. Recent research has shown
   that N isotopes in tree rings reflect changes in ecosystem nitrogen
   sources or cycles and can be used to study past changes. We analyzed
   trends in two tree species from a remote and pristine tropical
   rainforest in Brazil, using trees of different ages to distinguish
   between the effect of tree age and long-term trends. Because sapwood
   differed from heartwood in delta(15)N and N concentration and N can be
   translocated between living sapwood cells, long-term trends are best
   seen in dead heartwood. Heartwood delta(15) N in Spanish cedar (Cedrela
   odorata) and big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) increased with
   tree age, and N concentrations increased with age in Cedrela.
   Controlling for tree age, delta(15) N increased significantly during the
   past century even when analyzing only heartwood and after removing
   labile N compounds. In contrast to northern temperate and boreal forests
   where wood delta(15)N often decreased, the delta(15)N increase in a
   remote rainforest is unlikely to be a direct signal of changed N
   deposition. More plausibly, the change in N isotopic composition
   indicates a more open N cycle, i.e., higher N losses relative to
   internal N cycling in the forest which could be the result of changed
   forest dynamics.},

Abstract = {The nature of the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events (ERE)
   in central India is investigated by relating their occurrence to
   synoptic activity. Using a long record of the paths and intensities of
   monsoon synoptic disturbances, a synoptic activity index (SAI) is
   defined whose interannual variation correlates strongly with that in the
   number of ERE, demonstrating a strong connection between these
   phenomena. SAI furthermore shows a rising trend that is statistically
   indistinguishable from that in ERE, indicating that the increasing
   frequency of ERE is likely attributable to a rising trend in synoptic
   activity. This synoptic activity increase results from a rising trend in
   relatively weak low pressure systems (LPS), and it outweighs a declining
   trend in stronger LPS.},

Abstract = {The levels of a range of SVOCs (PAHs, OCPs, and PCBs) in atmospheric
   particulate and gaseous phases and rainwater samples were studied in
   Singapore from June 2007 to May 2008. Yearly average concentrations of
   PAHs, OCPs and PCBs in air (particle + gas) were 136.5 ng m(-3), 695.8
   pg m(-3) and 27 pg m(-3), respectively while those of PAHs and OCPs in
   rainwater (particulate + dissolved) were 1218.1 and 114.2 ng L-1,
   respectively. The lower molecular weight (LMW) PAHs were more abundant
   than those higher molecular weight (HMW) PAHs in rainwater. Among OCPs,
   HCHs were found in rainwater in relatively larger amounts than DDTs.
   Similar distributions patterns were also found in air samples.
   Statistical correlation analysis indicated that the atmospheric
   occurrence of SVOCs had positive correlation with ambient temperature
   except for particulate PAHs and negative correlations with relative
   humidity and wind speed; incoming solar radiation (SR) was negatively
   associated with PAHs, but there was almost no correlation between SR and
   the occurrence of OCPs and PCBs. ANOVA analysis revealed that the
   temporal variations were statistically significant for PAHs and PCBs in
   air samples and for OCPs in rainwater. In addition, local traffic
   emissions, trans-boundary transport of pesticides from regional sources
   and Aroclors 1248 and 1254 were identified as probable sources for PAHs,
   OCPs and PCBs in the atmosphere, respectively, based on molecular
   diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis (PCA) together with
   the assistance of air mass backward trajectories. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The study has analysed seasonal and annual rainfall and rainy days at
   five stations namely Srinagar, Kulgam, Handwara, Qazigund and Kukarnag
   to decipher rainfall trends over the Kashmir Valley. Rainfall data
   collected by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) were used. Due to
   the varying length of the available data, analysis was performed for two
   common periods: 1903-1982 (80 years) at three stations and 1962-2002 (41
   years) at three stations. The 102 years of data at Srinagar were also
   analysed to examine the trends for last century. Time series of annual
   and seasonal rainfall/rainy days were examined for trends by analysis of
   anomalies and application of statistical tests.
   During the period 1903-1982, Srinagar, Kulgam and Handwara stations
   experienced a decreasing trend in annual rainfall; the maximum decrease
   was found for Kulgam (-20.16\% of mean/100 years)and minimum for
   Srinagar (-2.45\% of mean/100 years). All three stations showed a
   decreasing trend in monsoon and winter rainfall and an increasing trend
   in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasonal rainfall. The decreasing trend
   in winter rainfall was found to be statistically significant (95\%
   confidence) at Kulgam and Handwara, whereas none of the increasing trend
   in the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season was significant. Srinagar and
   Handwara witnessed a decreasing (non-significant) trend in annual rainy
   days, whereas Kulgam experienced the opposite trend. All the stations
   experienced a decreasing trend in monsoon and winter rainy days.
   Qazigund and Kukarnag experienced decreasing annual rainfall, and
   Srinagar showed increasing annual rainfall during the period 1962-2002.
   Pre-monsoon and post-monsoon rainfall decreased at all three stations.
   None of the increasing/decreasing trends were found to be significant.
   Annual, pre-monsoon, post-monsoon and winter rainfall increased
   (non-significant) whereas monsoon rainfall decreased (non-significant),
   at Srinagar during the last century. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Abstract = {The distribution and variations of ammonium and the ammonia
   neutralization effect on acid rain were examined in East Asia during the
   period of 2000-05 using observed wet deposition data from the Acid
   Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia (EANET). Observational trends
   show a high proportion of NH4+ in the total cations, with a six-year
   mean proportion of over 20\% for continental and inland regions. The
   concentrations and deposition of NH4+ were higher in western China and
   Vietnam than in other regions. The annual variations in NH4+
   concentration were smooth in most of the regions, except for southern
   China and Vietnam, where the NH4+ concentrations increased, and western
   China, where the NH4+ concentrations decreased. The neutralization
   factors (NFs) of NH4+ indicate that ammonia has a great neutralization
   capability toward acid rain, including for the regions with low NH4+
   concentrations, such as Japan. The NFs were high in summer, with no
   obvious discrepancies between the northern and southern stations.
   However, the correlation coefficients between NH4+ concentrations and
   rain pH values imply that the ammonia neutralization effects on the pH
   values were distinct only at southern China and southern Japan stations.
   The neutralization of precipitation by ammonia was estimated by
   comparing the discrepancies between the observed pH values and the pH
   values calculated without ammonia consuming the H+ in NH4+. The results
   demonstrate that ammonia may increase annual mean pH values by 0.4-0.7
   in southern China and by 0.15-0.25 in southern Japan.},

Abstract = {Understanding and modelling Tasmanian rainfall variability and making
   future projections of Tasmanian rainfall are challenging tasks. Tasmania
   has spatially and temporally complex rainfall patterns. Rainfall
   variability is influenced by a complex suite of remote drivers and these
   influences vary by season. The Climate Futures for Tasmania
   high-resolution model simulations project small changes to annual
   rainfall averaged over Tasmania, but larger changes to the spatial
   patterns and seasonality of rainfall. A case study of changes to summer
   rainfall under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario is shown here.
   The projected summer decrease in rainfall in the western rainfall region
   is consistent with the southerly movement and intensification of the
   subtropical ridge as well as an enhancement of the high phase of the
   Southern Annular Mode. The increase along the east coastal strip is
   consistent with an increase in blocking in the Tasman Sea as well as an
   increase in sea surface temperature, relative humidity and convective
   rainfall. We propose that projections of rainfall for places like
   Tasmania are strengthened through dynamical downscaling and also the
   analysis of the rainfall mechanisms within the model at all length
   scales.},

Title = {Trends in rainfall and extreme temperatures in northwestern Mexico},
Journal = {CLIMATE RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {133-142},
Abstract = {The impact of global warming across northwestern Mexico is difficult to
   discern because long-term climatic data series are lacking, and this
   semi-arid region is subject to strong seasonal variability. Using data
   between 1922 and 2004 from 55 weather stations located in the State of
   Sonora, the Baja California Peninsula, and some stations in the United
   States near the Mexican border, we analyzed trends observed for weather
   variables. The magnitude and statistical significance of trends were
   determined, using the least squares regression procedure. Microregional
   series were delimited after applying varimax rotated empirical
   orthogonal functional analysis to the weather series. The limits between
   the 9 microregions were defined by considering a rotated factor loading
   >= 0.6. Series with significant trends were correlated with 5 different
   climatic indices: Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic Multi-decadal
   Oscillation, Southern Oscillation Index, North Atlantic Oscillation
   Index, and values of 700 hPa geopotential height anomalies. Results show
   that northwestern Mexico has high meteorological heterogeneity, as
   observed in spatial and seasonal variability of precipitation and
   temperature. Different trends were found across the region. Correlation
   analyses indicate that trends in several variables are associated with
   inter-decadal changes in the Pacific and the Atlantic, as well as with
   variations of the 700 hPa atmospheric flow patterns, changes in sea
   surface temperatures, penetration of extratropical fronts, and, for the
   State of Baja California Sur, higher incidence of tropical cyclones.},

Abstract = {The study of precipitation trends is critically important for a country
   like India whose food security and economy are dependent on the timely
   availability of water. In this work, monthly, seasonal and annual trends
   of rainfall have been studied using monthly data series of 135 years
   (1871-2005) for 30 sub-divisions (sub-regions) in India. Half of the
   sub-divisions showed an increasing trend in annual rainfall, but for
   only three (Haryana, Punjab and Coastal Karnataka), this trend was
   statistically significant. Similarly, only one sub-division
   (Chattisgarh) indicated a significant decreasing trend out of the 15
   sub-divisions showing decreasing trend in annual rainfall. In India, the
   monsoon months of June to September account for more than 80\% of the
   annual rainfall. During June and July, the number of sub-divisions
   showing increasing rainfall is almost equal to those showing decreasing
   rainfall. In August, the number of sub-divisions showing an increasing
   trend exceeds those showing a decreasing trend, whereas in September,
   the situation is the opposite. The majority of sub-divisions showed very
   little change in rainfall in non-monsoon months. The five main regions
   of India showed no significant trend in annual, seasonal and monthly
   rainfall in most of the months. For the whole of India, no significant
   trend was detected for annual, seasonal, or monthly rainfall. Annual and
   monsoon rainfall decreased, while pre-monsoon, post-monsoon and winter
   rainfall increased at the national scale. Rainfall in June, July and
   September decreased, whereas in August it increased, at the national
   scale.},

Abstract = {Statistical models for rainfall downscaling based on multiple linear
   regression techniques have been developed and tested in the Andean
   Region of west Argentina, an extended mountainous region where three
   different rain regimes predominate and rainfall has great spatial and
   temporal variability. The verification procedure was focused on the
   model's ability to reproduce observed rainfall trends in recent decades.
   In the northwest of Argentina, domain of the tropical summer rain
   regime, the monthly rainfall variance accounted for by downscaling
   models was 77\% on average and models reproduced satisfactorily the
   negative linear trend observed in the last two decades of the past
   century. In the arid central-west Argentina, a region of rapid
   transition between two different rain regimes, model performance was
   rather poor (an average of 50\% of explained variance), even so models
   were able to capture outstanding differences in the linear trend between
   the northern and southern sectors of the region. In the southwest of
   Argentina, domain of the mid-latitude winter rain regime, the monthly
   variance accounted for by downscaling models was 71\% on average and
   models were capable to reproduce a singular change in the onset of the
   rainy season that occurred during the 1990s. The results achieved
   demonstrate that it is feasible to establish significant and useful
   statistical relationships between atmospheric variables and rainfall at
   monthly and river basin scales, even for a topographically complex
   region like western Argentina.},

Abstract = {Rainfall series at 18 stations along the major rivers of the Brazilian
   Amazon Basin, having data since 1920s or 1930s, are analyzed to verify
   if there are appreciable long-term trends. Annual, rainy-season, and
   dry-season rainfalls are individually analyzed for each station and for
   the region as a whole. Some stations showed positive trends and some
   negative trends. The trends in the annual rainfall are significant at
   only six stations, five of which reporting increasing trends (Barcelos,
   Belem, Manaus, Rio Branco, and Soure stations) and just one (Itaituba
   station) reporting decreasing trend. The climatological values of
   rainfall before and after 1970 show significant differences at six
   stations (Barcelos, Belem, Benjamin Constant, Iaurete, Itaituba, and
   Soure). The region as a whole shows an insignificant and weak downward
   trend; therefore, we cannot affirm that the rainfall in the Brazilian
   Amazon basin is experiencing a significant change, except at a few
   individual stations. Subregions with upward and downward trends are
   interspersed in space from the far eastern Amazon to western Amazon.
   Most of the seasonal trends follow the annual trends, thus, indicating a
   certain consistency in the datasets and analysis.},

Abstract = {The results obtained from a conventional trend analysis of the Indian
   summer monsoon rainfall over a larger region are contradicted when
   analysis is performed at a finer resolution because of spatial
   variability and heterogeneity in the rainfall pattern. The present study
   analyzes the trend of summer monsoon rainfall all over India at a finer
   spatial resolution (1 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude) to
   identify the places that have a significant trend in terms of both
   rainfall amount and occurrence. The results obtained from this study are
   compared with those of a recent study by Goswami et al. (2006), where
   trend analysis is performed over a larger region {[}Central India (CI);
   10 degrees latitude x 12 degrees longitude; assumed to be homogeneous in
   that study]. The increasing trend of occurrence of heavy rainfall and
   decreasing trend of occurrence of moderate rainfall, as concluded from
   that study, are contradicted by the present results for some places in
   CI. The present analysis shows spatially varying mixed responses of
   global warming toward rainfall occurrence and amounts all over India.
   The perception of increase in daily rainfall amount and occurrence due
   to climate change is found to be not correct for some of the regions in
   India. The possible reason may be the spatial variability of local
   changes such as rapid urbanization, industrialization and deforestation.

Abstract = {During the last two decades (1979-2002), there has been an
   ever-increasing frequency of summer severe-rainfall events over Ontario,
   Canada. This observed upward trend is robust as demonstrated through the
   Mann-Kendall test with consideration of removing a lag-1 autoregressive
   process. It is shown through composite analyses using the NCEP
   reanalysis data that in the presence of warming conditions the summer
   severe-rainfall events occur more frequently over Ontario, especially
   under atmospheric conditions with stronger low-level cyclonic
   circulations and more precipitable water. Further analyses indicate that
   over north and central Ontario the summer severe-rainfall frequency is
   linked with a positive trend of precipitable water whereas over central
   and south Ontario there is a strong interannual response of summer
   severe-rainfall frequency to the changes in precipitable water through
   the variations of air temperature.},

Abstract = {This study assesses long-term rainfall records in the KwaZulu-Natal
   Drakensberg, South Africa's most valuable source of surface runoff.
   Records from 11 stations covering the Drakensberg region in South Africa
   indicate that no statistically significant trend in interannual
   variability existed during the last half of the twentieth century.
   Annual rainfall in the Drakensberg is highly Seasonal, and analysis of
   monthly rainfall indicates an increase in the variability of the
   distribution of monthly rainfall and the strengthening of rainfall
   seasonality in the Drakensberg through a significant decrease in autumn
   rainfall. The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences summer
   rainfall variability of the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg, and a strong
   correlation also exists between summer rainfall and the Southern
   Oscillation Index (SOI) for preceding periods. This correlation between
   Summer rainfall and ENSO events suggests that changes in the frequency
   and intensity of the ENSO should affect the rainfall in the Drakensberg.
   The lagged correlation between summer rainfall in the Drakensberg and
   the SOI could be used as an indicator for seasonal forecasting.

Volume = {375},
Number = {1-2, SI},

Abstract = {To document trends in land use and herbaceous production, 71 field sites
   sampled among cropped fields, fallow fields and rangelands in the Fakara
   region (Niger) were monitored from 1994 to 2006. The overall trend in
   land use confirmed the historical increase of the cropped areas since
   mid 20th century, at an annual rate of 2\% from 1994 to 2006. This trend
   is the result of changes in the relative extent of fields permanently
   cropped and fields under shifting cultivation, and for the latter, the
   relative proportion of short (3 years) and long (10 years) duration
   fallows. Type of land use together with topography and soil type
   determine the herbaceous production and the resulting yield measured
   towards the end of the wet season. The variation in site yields between
   years is of the same order of magnitude as the variation in yields
   between sites within a year. There is an overall decreasing trend in
   site yields by 5\% annually from 1994 to 2006 that is not explained by
   variations in rainfall. The decreasing trend is observed on fields under
   shifting cultivation, fallowed fields and rangelands, although not all
   sites are equally affected. Causes are likely to be multiple which might
   include changes in land use, decline of soil fertility and increased
   grazing pressure. Indeed, the remaining rangelands on marginal land and
   the fallows still accessible to livestock are subject to such a heavy
   grazing during the rainy season that the herbaceous standing mass
   measured at the end of the season reflects poorly the actual production.
   After the two first years of cropping, the herbaceous yield in fields
   under shifting cultivation with no fertilisation is negatively affected
   by the number of successive years of cropping. Moreover, clearing fallow
   after a decreasing number of years affects the mean herbaceous yield of
   fallowed fields by reducing the contribution of more productive old
   fallows. Changes in land use, grazing pressure and soil fertility also
   triggered changes in species composition with a strong reduction in
   diversity from rangelands to fallows, and again from fallows to cropland
   weeds. No correlations was found however between productivity and
   species composition. Cumulative rainfall does not explain between site
   or between year deviations in herbaceous yield even when sites are
   sorted by land use type or by soil type in the case of fallow and
   rangelands. Simulated production calculated with the STEP model does not
   explain herbaceous yields much better even when sites are grouped by
   land use and soil type. However, relative changes of herbaceous yields
   are reasonably predicted on sites that remained fallowed and were not
   heavily grazed for at least four consecutive years. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {One motivation for setting up the CATCH (Couplage de l'Atmosphere
   Tropicale et du Cycle Hydrologique) project at the end of the 1990s, was
   to contribute to documenting the Sahelian rainfall variability at the
   interannual scale and to provide a fine monitoring of possible long-term
   trends of the rainfall regime. This paper is a first attempt at
   characterising the Sahelian rainfall regime of the two last decades
   (19902007) by comparison to the rainfall regime of the previous decades,
   namely the 20-year wet period 19501969 and the 20-year dry period
   1970-1989. While the rainfall deficit remained unabated in the Western
   Sahel (1990-2007 mean equal to the 1970-1989 mean, both being lower than
   the 1950-1969 mean), the Central Sahel progressively recorded wetter
   years from the end of the 1990s, but this recovery is limited (1990-2007
   average larger by 10\% than the 1970-1989 average, but still lower than
   the 1950-1989 average). There are also significant differences between
   the Western Sahel and the Central Sahel when looking at the interannual
   variability pattern and at the seasonal cycle. The low-frequency
   rainfall patterns are similar between the Western Sahel and the Central
   Sahel, but the interannual year-to-year variability is weakly related to
   each other. in the Central Sahel, the major modification of the seasonal
   cycle in the most recent decades was the disappearance of the well
   marked August peak observed during the wet period. In the Western Sahel
   the rainfall deficit is more or less evenly distributed all along the
   rainy season. The second part of the paper makes use of the CATCH-Niger
   recording rain gauge network in order to compare several ways of
   defining rainy events. The statistical properties of these various
   populations of rainy events are compared. It is shown that a simple CPP
   model allows for retrieving the statistical characteristics of point
   rainy events from daily rainfall series. It is also confirmed that in
   this area, the interannual rainfall variability is primarily linked to
   the year-to-year fluctuation of the number of large mesoscale rainfall
   events. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since climate trends are getting considerable attention in recent years,
   we aimed in this study to compare trends and rhythms of complexity
   (fractal dimension, FD) of rainfall data series between two continents:
   Latin America and Europe. Two parallel nonlinear methods for calculating
   FD of a temporal data series, Higuchi's and consecutive differences,
   were combined with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain FD
   oscillations of monthly accumulated rainfall. The data were collected
   for the last thirty years in Pastaza province, Ecuador and Veneto
   province, Italy. In order to calculate their FD time dependence, FD(t),
   moving windows of different lengths (short, 10-20 and long 21-350
   samples), were applied. Both methods, each combined with FFT, detected
   identical (or very similar) rhythms of detrended FD(t) in the two data
   series, but frequencies with dominant amplitudes differed (4.4 years in
   Ecuador, 10.3 years in Italy). Long-term FD(t) trends were also studied
   using optimized long window lengths (similar to 200 samples). A linear
   positive trend was obtained for the Ecuadorian rainfall data over the
   whole recorded period. Italian fractal trend profile was, however,
   characterized by two periods: a constant high value for years 1974-1993,
   followed by a linear decrease for 1993-2005. Trend results, obtained
   with two different methods, were also similar. Accordance of the
   results, reported in the present paper by applying these two methods,
   validates their use as a tool in future fractal meteorological
   measurements. As well, these results indicate that positive ID trend
   obtained for Pastaza (Ecuador) and negative trend computed for Veneto
   (Italy) account for a local or regional phenomenon, most probably caused
   by extensive deforestation and land use change (Ecuador) and continental
   or global atmospheric pattern variability (Italy). (C) 2009 Published by

Abstract = {Importance of monsoon depressions, LOW Pressure Systems (LPS) and file
   number of LPS days on rainfall and hence indirectly on agriculture and
   hydrology, is well recognized.
   In this Paper the Pattern of annual variability in these systems have
   been examined Using data from 1901-2000. The above mentioned parameters
   have been subjected to decadal analysis to detect presence of any
   regular pattern. An attempt has been made to find its tendency with
   time. Impact of these systems on central India rainfall has been
   determined and discussed.
   The study endorses the earlier findings that there is a decreasing,
   trend in the frequency of depressions which has been compensated with
   increase in LPS days over Indian region in recent years. The rainfall
   over central India is more significantly related with a number of LPS
   days over Indian region.},

Abstract = {The precipitation data for some regions in South Africa were studied for
   the period 1900-1998. From the 11 regions examined, 8 in South Africa
   had maximum precipitations in the austral summer months (December,
   January, February, March), while 3 had maxima in autumn and winter.
   Annual values showed considerable year-to-year fluctuations (50\% to
   200\% of the mean), while five-year running means showed long-term
   fluctuations (75\% to 150\% of the mean). A spectrum analysis indicated
   periodicities in the ranges 2-3 (quasi-biennial oscillation, QBO), 3-4
   (quasi-triennial oscillation, QTO), 6-11,17-21, 23-26, 32-35 and 55-66
   years, some common to, and some different in different regions. The QBO
   and QTO accounted for a substantial fraction (30-50\%) of the total
   variance. In five-year running means, the effects of QBO and QTO were
   suppressed considerably. The plots showed distinct peaks, but the
   spacings varied in a wide range, indicating that predictions based on
   extrapolation of single peaks are not likely to come true even for
   decadal averages. El Nino effects for the giant event of 1982/83 were as
   expected but those for 1997/98 were obscure, almost absent. Running
   means over 21 years did not indicate linear trends, upwards or
   downwards. Instead, considerable oscillations were seen, with magnitudes
   different in different regions (5-25\%). On average, high values during
   1915/16 decreased considerably (5-8\%) up to 1935, oscillated upwards
   thereafter and recouped by 1980, but decreased considerably thereafter.},

Abstract = {Trends in Australian precipitation from 1970 to 2006 are examined using
   a daily rainfall dataset. Results suggest a linkage between changes in
   the monsoon trough and rainfall trends over northwestern Australia. The
   late twentieth century drought observed along file Queensland coast is a
   response to changes in the atmospheric circulation that generates
   anomalous subsidence at high and middle levels of the atmosphere, thus
   inhibiting convection over the region. In addition, an anomalous
   anticyclonic circulation at low levels over Queensland tends to weaken
   the easterlies in the tropical western Pacific, thus diminishing the
   transport of moist air onto the coast. Trends in the frequency and
   magnitude of different rainfall events are also examined. This reveals
   that changes in total rainfall are dominated by trends in very heavy
   rainfall events across Australia. For example, some parts of western
   Australia reveal an increase in heavy rainfall events that are not
   accompanied by a rise in modest rainfall events, resulting in changes in
   the shape of the distribution towards a more skewed precipitation
   distribution. Oil the other hand, the frequency of extreme rainfall
   events along the Queensland coast has declined during summer and autumn
   consistently with the total rainfall decrease, indicating changes in the
   position of the precipitation distribution rather than its shape.

Title = {Southern Australian rainfall and the subtropical ridge: Variations,
   interrelationships, and trends},
Journal = {GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Monthly values of the latitude and intensity (mean maximum pressure) of
   the subtropical ridge (STR), averaged across Australian longitudes
   (105-155 degrees E), have been related to variations and trends in
   rainfall over southern Australia (south of 30 degrees S), for 1958-2005.
   There is an abrupt shift of latitude of the subtropical ridge over
   Australia at the onset of winter. In the cooler part of the year the
   intensity of the STR is more closely related to rainfall variations (and
   correlations between latitude and rainfall are a by-product of the
   relationship of intensity with both latitude and rainfall), whereas in
   summer the latitude of the STR is more closely related to rainfall. The
   decline in southern Australian rainfall in recent decades (which has
   occurred principally in autumn) appears related to a trend towards a
   more intense STR, rather than a trend in the latitude of the STR.

Pages = {1105-1118},

Abstract = {An extensive dataset (230 precipitation gauges and 79 stream gauges) was
   used to analyse rainfall-runoff relationships in 10 subregions of a
   482000 km(2) area in the south-eastern USA (Maryland, Virginia, North
   Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia). The average annual rainfall and
   runoff for this study area between 1938 and 2005 were 1201 and 439 mm,
   respectively. Average runoff/rainfall ratios during this period varied
   between 0.24 in the southern most Coastal Plain subregion to 0.64 in the
   Blue Rid-e Province. Watershed elevation and relief are the principal
   determinants governing the conversion of rainfall to runoff. Temporal
   rainfall variation throughout the south-eastern USA ranges from similar
   to 40\% above and below normal while the variation for runoff is higher,
   from -75\% to +100\%. In any given year there can exist a +/- 25-50\%
   error in predicted runoff deviation using the annual rainfall-runoff
   regression. Fast Fourier Transform and autoregressive spectral analysis
   revealed dominant cyclicities for rainfall and runoff between 14 and 17
   years. Secondary periodicities were typically between 6-7 and 10-12
   years. The inferred cyclicity may be related to ENSO and/or Central
   North Pacific atmospheric phenomena. Mann-Kendall analyses indicate that
   there were no consistent statistically significant temporal trends with
   respect to Southeastern US rainfall and runoff during the Study period.
   The results of U-tests similarly indicated that rainfall between 1996
   and 2005 was not statistically higher or lower than during earlier in
   the Study period. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Attempts were made to study temporal variation in monthly, seasonal and
   annual rainfall over Kerala, India, during the period from 1871 to 2005.
   Longterm changes in rainfall determined by Man-Kendall rank statistics
   and linear trend. The analysis revealed significant decrease in
   southwest monsoon rainfall while increase in post-monsoon season over
   the State of Kerala which is popularly known as the ``Gateway of summer
   monsoon{''}. Rainfall during winter and summer seasons showed
   insignificant increasing trend. Rainfall during June and July showed
   significant decreasing trend while increasing trend in January. February
   and April. Hydel power generation and water availability during summer
   months are the concern in the State due to rainfall decline in June and
   July, which are the rainiest months. At the same time, majority of
   plantation crops are likely to benefit due to increase in rainfall
   during the post-monsoon season if they are stable and prolonged. (C)

Abstract = {The question of how to assess trends in rainfall data is very relevant
   to that of climate change. A short review of prior work revealed that
   there was little consensus on the methodology to be adopted. Many
   methods had been tried and abandoned. Some methods had found
   comparatively wide acceptance although they employed a statistical
   software package that is not readily available, and which does not have
   tools common to other more widely available packages. In the light of
   this review, it was decided to start from the inherent distribution of
   rainfall and develop a method for determining temporal trends based on
   the underlying distribution. Data sets from 4 different locations and
   covering sample periods from every 5 min to every week were assessed. In
   each case it was found that the data could be represented extremely well
   by a log-normal distribution, which meant that normal statistics could
   be applied to the transformed data. When it was so applied, clear trends
   emerged, the significance of which could be readily judged via an F-test
   or t-test. Some worked examples are provided. Attention is drawn to the
   possibility of estimating the likelihood of extreme events by this
   method. It is also noted that the usual method of reporting rainfall as
   an arithmetic average overstates the precipitation, and that on
   statistical grounds use of a geometric mean is to be preferred.},

   extreme events. However, in this investigation, we assembled daily
   precipitation records for 142 stations in southern Mexico over the
   period 1960-2004 and calculated 23 different annual indicators of
   extreme precipitation events that have been widely used in the
   professional literature. Ultimately using 44 of these stations with the
   most complete records, we used various univanate and multivariate
   statistical procedures to uncover the underlying significant upward
   trend in the occurrence of extreme events. Furthermore, we found that
   the variations in extreme events were significantly related to El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
   (ODP), with extreme events tending to occur more frequently during La
   Nina periods and during the positive phase of the ODP.},

Abstract = {The present study performs the spatial and temporal trend analysis of
   the annual and 24-hr maximum rainfall of a set of 145 precipitation
   gauging stations of Iran. The study shows that the annual rainfall is
   decreasing at 67\% of the stations while the 24-hr maximum rainfall is
   increasing at 50\% of the stations. The negative trends of annual
   rainfall are mostly observed in northern and northwestern regions,
   whereas positive trends of 24-hr maximum rainfall are mostly located in
   arid and semiarid regions of Iran. However, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
   for Mann-Kendall (MK) statistics show that the regional trend of annual
   rainfall is significant, but it is not significant for 24-hr maximum
   rainfall. On the other hand, the sequential MK test reveals that the
   trends of annual rainfall and 24-hr maximum rainfall began since 1970s
   for most of the stations. The negative trend of the rainfall for most of
   the country may show the initial stages of climate change in Iran, but
   further information and analysis is required for future studies.},

Abstract = {A hierarchical spatial model for daily rainfall extremes that
   characterizes their temporal variation due to interannual climatic
   forcing as well as their spatial pattern is proposed. The model treats
   the parameters of at-site probability distributions for rainfall
   extremes as ``data'' that are likely to be spatially correlated and
   driven by atmospheric forcing. The method is applied to daily rainfall
   extremes for summer and winter half years over the Swan-Avon River basin
   in Western Australia. Two techniques for the characterization of at-site
   extremes-peaks-over-threshold (POT) analysis and the generalized extreme
   value (GEV) distribution-and three climatic drivers-the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation as measured by the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), the
   Southern Hemisphere annular mode as measured by an Antarctic Oscillation
   index (AOI), and solar irradiance (SI)-were considered. The POT analysis
   of at-site extremes revealed that at-site thresholds lacked spatial
   coherence, making it difficult to determine a smooth spatial surface for
   the threshold parameter. In contrast, the GEV-based analysis indicated
   smooth spatial patterns in daily rainfall extremes that are consistent
   with the predominant orientation of storm tracks over the study area and
   the presence of a coastal escarpment near the western edge of the basin.
   It also indicated a linkage between temporal trends in daily rainfall
   extremes and those of the SOI and AOI. By applying the spatial models to
   winter and summer extreme rainfalls separately, an apparent increasing
   trend in return levels of summer rainfall to the northwest and
   decreasing trends in return levels of winter rainfall to the southwest
   of the region are found.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to carry a descriptive analysis in the
   monthly precipitation of rainfall stations from Rio de Janeiro State,
   Brazil, using data of position and dispersion and graphical analyses,
   and to verify the presence of seasonality and trend in these data, with
   a study about the application of models of time series. The descriptive
   statistics was to characterize the general behavior of the series in
   three stations selected which present consistent historical series. The
   methodology of analysis of variance in randomized blocks and the
   determination of models of multiple linear regression, considering years
   and months as predictors variables, disclosed the presence of
   seasonality, what allowed to infer on the occurrence of repetitive
   natural phenomena throughout the time and absence of trend in the data.
   It was applied the methodology of multiple linear regression to removal
   the seasonality of these time series. The original data had been
   deducted from the estimates made by the adjusted model and the analysis
   of variance in randomized blocks for the residues of regression was
   preceded again. With the results obtained it was possible to conclude
   that the monthly rainfall present seasonality and they don't present
   trend, the analysis of multiple regression was efficient in the removal
   of the seasonality, and the rainfall can be studied by means of time
   series.},

Abstract = {The fact that climate change is affecting the intensity and frequency of
   rainfall is well accepted in the scientific community. This is backed by
   a multitude of reports on the basis of daily rainfall series analysis;
   however, little research is available for short duration intensities.
   Due to its significant influence on the behaviour of urban drainage, it
   is critical to investigate the changes in short duration rainfall
   intensities. In this study different intensities relevant for the urban
   drainage and the total rainfall per rain event are analysed. The trend
   is investigated using the Mann-Kendall test. The rainfall series
   analysed are from the alpine region Tyrol. The results present
   differences depending on the duration of the intensity and the series
   considered, however an increase in the number of extreme events is
   detectable for short durations for the most series.},

Title = {Aerosol and rainfall variability over the Indian monsoon region:
   distributions, trends and coupling},
Journal = {ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {27},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3691-3703},
Abstract = {Aerosol solar absorption over the Indian monsoon region has a potential
   role of modulating the monsoon circulation and rainfall distribution as
   suggested by recent studies based on model simulations. Prior to the
   onset of the monsoon, northern India is influenced by significant dust
   transport that constitutes the bulk of the regional aerosol loading over
   the Gangetic-Himalayan region. In this paper, a multi-sensor
   characterization of the increasing pre-monsoon aerosol loading over
   northern India, in terms of their spatial, temporal and vertical
   distribution is presented. Aerosol transport from the northwestern arid
   regions into the Indo-Gangetic Plains and over the foothills of the
   Himalayas is found to be vertically extended to elevated altitudes (up
   to 5 km) as observed from the space-borne lidar measurements (CALIPSO).
   In relation with the enhanced pre-monsoon aerosol loading and the
   associated solar absorption effects on tropospheric temperature
   anomalies, this paper investigates the monsoon rainfall variability over
   India in recent past decades from an observational viewpoint. It is
   found that the early summer monsoon rainfall over India is on the rise
   since 1950s, as indicated by historical rainfall data, with over 20\%
   increase for the period 1950-2004. This large sustained increase in the
   early summer rainfall is led by the observed strengthening of the
   pre-monsoon tropospheric land-sea thermal gradient over the Indian
   monsoon region as indicated by microwave satellite measurements (MSU) of
   tropospheric temperatures from 1979-2007. Combined analysis of changes
   in tropospheric temperatures and summer monsoon rainfall in the past
   three decades, suggest a future possibility of an emerging rainfall
   pattern of a wetter monsoon over South Asia in early summer followed by
   a drier period.},

Abstract = {This study examines the trend in the 7-year monthly rainfall amounts
   (September 2001 August 2008) observed by the TRMM Precipitation Radar
   (PR). It is shown that the monthly rainfall amounts averaged in the
   range of 35 degrees S to 35 degrees N (PR observation range) tend to
   increase slightly over this period. This tendency can be considered to
   be affected by sampling errors due to the narrow observation swaths of
   the PR, in addition to natural variations. Therefore, this study
   developed the method of evaluating the sampling errors by a bootstrap
   method using the actual data observed by the PR. We examined the trend
   in the averaged rainfall amounts during 7 years considering the
   simulated sampling errors. As a result, the positive trend was
   significantly detected, even when sampling error was removed. From this,
   it can be concluded that this positive trend is highly likely to be due
   to natural variations.},

Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1563-1576},
Abstract = {Leaf size influences many aspects of tree function such as rates of
   transpiration and photosynthesis and, consequently, often varies in a
   predictable way in response to environmental gradients. The recent
   development of pan-Amazonian databases based on permanent botanical
   plots has now made it possible to assess trends in leaf size across
   environmental gradients in Amazonia. Previous plot-based studies have
   shown that the community structure of Amazonian trees breaks down into
   at least two major ecological gradients corresponding with variations in
   soil fertility (decreasing from southwest to northeast) and length of
   the dry season (increasing from northwest to south and east). Here we
   describe the geographic distribution of leaf size categories based on
   121 plots distributed across eight South American countries. We find
   that the Amazon forest is predominantly populated by tree species and
   individuals in the mesophyll size class (20.25-182.25 cm(2)). The
   geographic distribution of species and individuals with large leaves
   (>20.25 cm(2)) is complex but is generally characterized by a higher
   proportion of such trees in the northwest of the region. Spatially
   corrected regressions reveal weak correlations between the proportion of
   large-leaved species and metrics of water availability. We also find a
   significant negative relationship between leaf size and wood density.},

Abstract = {The Warragamba catchment, which supplies about 80\% of Greater Sydney's
   drinking water, reached an all time low of 32.4\% in February 2007.
   Questions were raised about the adequacy of the water infrastructure to
   meet the water needs of Sydney and whether the reduction in storage was
   a result of decreasing rainfall trend in the region. This paper attempts
   to answer these questions by investigating the long-term rainfall
   pattern in the Warragamba catchment area and investigates the seasonal
   and annual changes in rainfall patterns. Statistical analysis of
   available rainfall data indicates a trend of decreasing rainfall of
   2.52mm/year between the period of 1945 and 1998 whereas between 1890 and
   2003, a linear increasing trend of 0.32mm/year was observed. Three
   Substantial drought periods have occurred over the Study period. These
   periods were identified as 1901-1910, 1939-1948 and 2000-2006. Out of
   these, the 1901-1910 drought was the most severe one, followed by the
   1939-1948 drought. The most recent drought (2000-2006) was the least
   severe among the three recorded. However, it is the only drought of
   significant duration that has occurred since the completion of
   construction of Warragamba Dam in 1960.},

Title = {Twenty years of understorey bird extinctions from Amazonian rain forest
   fragments: consistent trends and landscape-mediated dynamics},

Abstract = {We analysed presence/absence data for understorey bird species in rain
   forest fragments sampled from 1979 through 2001. Here we consider
   extinctions between 1992, when most fragments had been isolated for at
   least 8 years, and 2001. Our objectives were to determine whether high
   extinction rates documented soon after isolation continued through up to
   20 years after isolation, and to examine fragment size and landscape
   effects on extinction.
   Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil.
   Through 1992, birds were surveyed with standardized mist net sampling in
   ten 1- to 100-ha fragments. We repeated the mist net protocol in
   2000-01. We also added remote taping of the dawn chorus and tape
   playback surveys for species captured in 1991-92 but not in 2000-01.
   Between 1992 and 2001, 37 species went extinct in at least one fragment.
   As expected, extinction rate decreased with increasing fragment size.
   Over 30\% of species went extinct in 1-ha fragments, compared to about
   5\% in 100-ha fragments. Extinction followed a predictable pattern: most
   species lost from 100-ha fragments between 1992 and 2001 had already
   gone extinct in smaller fragments before 1992. Despite extinctions,
   fragments gained species between 1992 and 2001, apparently due to
   species moving through the developing second growth matrix. Fragments
   surrounded by old second growth had lower extinction rates than
   predicted based on fragment size alone.
   Sequential extinctions occurred for at least 20 years. Some additional
   species previously lost from smaller fragments may continue to go
   extinct in 100-ha fragments. At the same time, species assemblages in 1-
   and 10-ha fragments mostly reflect second-growth dynamics by 20 years
   after isolation. High species loss predicted from the first few years
   after isolation has not occurred, almost certainly because of
   recolonization.},

Abstract = {Monthly rainfall over Kerala state showed an increasing tendency during
   October and November with a decrease in December. Such trend was more
   evident since 1961 onwards. Overall, over Kerala State, there was an
   increase of 96.7 mm in northeast monsoon rainfall over a period of time,
   indicating an increase of 20.1 per cent against the normal rainfall of
   481.5 mm and significant at 5 per cent level. Rainfall during December
   was highly variable and undependable, which is of great concern in
   plantation crop production of the State of Kerala. As a whole, 34.0 per
   cent (46 years out of 135) of the years recorded either excess or
   deficit rainfall. The monthly rainfall range as well as its variability
   was less during excess rainfall years when compared to that of deficit
   rainfall years. The study also revealed that El Nino/La Nina events had
   weak teleconnection with excess/deficit northeast monsoon rainfall over
   Kerala.},

Abstract = {As a country whose economy is heavily dependent on low-productivity
   rainfed agriculture, rainfall trends are often cited as one of the more
   important factors in explaining various socio-economic problems such as
   food insecurity. Therefore, in order to help policyrnakers and
   developers make more informed decisions, this study investigated the
   temporal dynamics of rainfall and its spatial distribution within
   Ethiopia. Changes in rainfall were examined using data from 134 stations
   in 13 watersheds between 1960 and 2002. The variability and trends in
   seasonal and annual rainfall were analysed at the watershed scale with
   data (1) from all available years, and (2) excluding years that lacked
   observations front at least 25\% of the gauges. Similar analyses were
   also performed at the gauge, regional, and national levels. By
   regressing annual watershed rainfall on time, results from the
   one-sample t-test show no significant changes in rainfall for any of the
   watersheds examined. However, in our regressions of seasonal rainfall
   averages against time, we found a significant decline in June to
   September rainfall (i.e. Kiremt) for the Baro-Akobo, Omo-Ghibe, Rift
   Valley, and Southern Blue Nile watersheds located in the southwestern
   and central parts of Ethiopia. While the gauge level analysis showed
   that certain gauge stations experienced recent changes in rainfall,
   these trends are not necessarily reflected at the watershed or regional
   levels. Copyright (c) 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

Abstract = {Periodicity and trend, modelled with emphasis on stochastic aspects
   using the Gibbs procedure in Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, are
   incorporated in multisite daily rainfall simulation. In particular, this
   gives realistic results for the timing of annual maximums within an
   annual cycle. A truncated Fourier series of two harmonics is used to
   model the deterministic part of the periodicity component. A
   reduced-parameter two-station model is extended for multisite
   simulation. Results show that depth-duration curves and characteristics
   such as cross-correlations are adequately represented. Projections are
   made, after applying the Gibbs procedure to sub-samples of 25 years, to
   form enveloping trend curves of possible future rainfalls. These are
   augmented by extending a trend line back in time previous to a historic
   record, using the relationship with a Longer series of rainfall data
   from a homogeneous zone. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Probabilistic trend of anomalous summer rainfall in Beijing: Role of

Abstract = {The interdecadal variability of summer precipitation in Beijing from
   1724 to 2005 is analyzed using a filter, keeping the true trends at time
   series ends. A probability distribution, Pearson type III, was applied
   to the summer precipitation series to estimate the probability of
   anomalous rainfall. This study includes the correlation between the
   interdecadal variations of the summer precipitation in Beijing and those
   of the indices of Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Southern
   Oscillation (SOI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and summer monsoon
   (SMS) of East Asia indices are computed. A methodology is thus developed
   to forecast the probable distribution of precipitation intensities in
   Beijing. Results show that the probability of drought in Beijing has
   greatly increased since the middle of the 1960s. The interdecadal
   variability of NAO, PDO, and SMS are extremely important for the
   low-frequency forecast of anomalous summer rainfall in Beijing. The
   method developed here seems appropriate to estimate the probability of
   future anomalous summer rainfall.},

Abstract = {In this study, using 104 years ( 1901 - 2004) of high resolution daily
   gridded rainfall data, variability and long-term trends of extreme
   rainfall events over central India have been examined. Frequency of
   extreme rainfall events shows significant inter-annual and inter-decadal
   variations in addition to a statistically significant long term trend of
   6\% per decade. Detailed analysis shows that inter-annual, inter-decadal
   and long-term trends of extreme rainfall events are modulated by the SST
   variations over the tropical Indian Ocean. The present study supports
   the hypothesis that the increasing trend of extreme rainfall events in
   the last five decades could be associated with the increasing trend of
   sea surface temperatures and surface latent heat flux over the tropical
   Indian Ocean. In the global warming scenario, the coherent relationship
   between Indian Ocean SST and extreme rainfall events suggests an
   increase in the risk of major floods over central India.},

Abstract = {New monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall time series of 36
   meteorological subdivisions of India were constructed using the monthly
   rainfall data for the period 1901-2003 of fixed network of 1476 rain
   gauge stations. In the new network, on an average, there is one rain
   gauge station for every 3402 Sq km area. The new rainfall series is
   temporally as well as spatially homogenous. Linear trend analysis was
   carried out to examine the long-term trends in rainfall over different
   subdivisions and monthly contribution of each of the monsoon months to
   annual rainfall. During the south-west monsoon season, three
   subdivisions viz. Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Kerala showed significant
   decreasing trend and eight subdivisions viz. Gangetic WB, West UP, Jammu
   and Kashmir, Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra subdivision, Rayalseema,
   Coastal AP and North Interior Karnataka showed significant increasing
   trends. It has been found that the contribution of June, July and
   September rainfall to annual rainfall is decreasing for few subdivisions
   while contribution of August rainfall is increasing in few other
   subdivisions. EOF analysis is also done to know the spatial distribution

Abstract = {Winter rainfall on the Iberian Peninsula presents a significant decrease
   in its western and central areas throughout the second half of the 20th
   century, whereas over the eastern fringe it shows hardly any variation.
   This spatial distribution of precipitation trends are related to
   teleconnection indices trends and changes in the frequency Of Surface
   circulation patterns over Western Europe. We determined these
   circulation patterns by carrying out a daily objective synoptic
   classification by means of a principal components analysis (PCA) using
   sea-level pressure (SLP) data. In order to better understand Iberian
   winter precipitation trends, circulation patterns are associated with
   those teleconnection patterns that have an important influence on
   Iberian rainfall: Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation
   (NAO) and Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO). The circulation
   pattern showing the biggest increases involves high pressure over
   Central Europe. This pattern is showing a positive AO and NAO phase, and
   simultaneously, a negative WeMO phase. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Investigation was made on whether the recent historical changes in
   frequency and amplitude of rainfall extremes can be considered
   statistically significant under the hypothesis of no trend or temporal
   clustering of rainfall extremes. The analysis was based on a 107-year
   time series of 10-min Peaks-Over-Threshold rainfall data obtained from
   the Uccle station in Belgium. Rainfall intensities were aggregated at
   levels ranging from 10 min to the monthly scale, and defined for
   different seasons and block lengths between 5 and 15 years using sliding
   windows. Perturbations in rainfall extremes were derived, which
   represent the empirical quantile changes. Significant deviations in
   rainfall quantiles were found, which persisted for periods of 10 to 15
   years. In the winter and summer seasons, high extremes were clustered in
   the 1910s-1920s, the 1960s and recently in the 1990s. This temporal
   clustering highlights the difficulty of attributing ``change'' in
   climate series to anthropogenically induced global warming. Research in
   a variety of climate phenomena is essential for the attribution of
   changes in the climate.},

Title = {Patterns of invasion: Trends in abundance of understory vegetation, seed

Journal = {NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Non-native species are often abundant in the vegetation of forest edges,
   decreasing in abundance with distance into the forest interior.
   Regenerative strategies such as the seed rain and seed bank were
   expected to exhibit a similar pattern of decrease from the edge to the
   interior; however, this has been rarely investigated. Trends in
   abundance of the understory vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank of both
   native and non-native plant species from forest edge to interior at
   three different natural areas bordered respectively by a crop, a hay
   field, and a forest access road were quantified. Three 90 m transects
   were established perpendicularly across each of the three edge types
   into the forest interior. Twelve 3.14 m(2) circular plots 5 m apart for
   the first 20 m and 10 m apart thereafter were established along each
   transect. We compared the abundance of all vascular plant species in the
   vegetation, seed rain, and the soil seed bank in these plots. Species
   richness of the vegetation, the seed rain, and the seed bank (native and
   non-native species combined) decreased from the forest edge into the
   interior. Sixteen non-native species were observed and were limited to
   30 m from the forest edge. Out of these 16 non-native species, > 50\%
   were found only in the seed bank. We observed different trends in
   abundance of native and non-native vegetation, seed rain, and seed bank
   for some species. Our study suggests that removing aboveground biomass
   of non-native species may not be the only thing to consider in
   non-native species management because of the high frequency of
   additional non-native species in the seed bank that are absent from the
   existing vegetation. In order to minimize non-native species, managers
   should eradicate seedlings of non-native species along forest edges
   before they mature and produce seed.},

Title = {Variability and trend of North West Australia rainfall: Observations and

Abstract = {Since 1950, there has been an increase in rainfall over North West
   Australia (NWA), occurring mainly during the Southern Hemisphere (SH)
   summer season. A recent study using twentieth-century multimember
   ensemble simulations in a global climate model forced with and without
   increasing anthropogenic aerosols suggests that the rainfall increase is
   attributable to increasing Northern Hemisphere aerosols. The present
   study investigates the dynamics of the observed trend toward increased
   rainfall and compares the observed trend with that generated in the
   model forced with increasing aerosols.
   It is found that the observed positive trend in rainfall is projected
   onto two modes of variability. The first mode is associated with an
   anomalously low mean sea level pressure (MSLP) off NWA instigated by the
   enhanced sea surface temperature (SST) gradients toward the coast. The
   associated cyclonic flows bring high-moisture air to northern Australia,
   leading to an increase in rainfall. The second mode is associated with
   an anomalously high MSLP over much of the Australian continent; the
   anticyclonic circulation pattern, over northern Australia, determines
   that when rainfall is anomalously high, west of 130 E, rainfall is
   anomalously low east of this longitude. The sum of the upward trends in
   these two modes compares well to the observed increasing trend pattern.
   The modeled rainfall trend, however, is generated by a different
   process. The model suffers from an equatorial cold-tongue bias: the
   tongue of anomalies associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation extends
   too far west into the eastern Indian Ocean. Consequently, there is an
   unrealistic relationship in the SH summer between Australian rainfall
   and eastern Indian Ocean SST: the rise in SST is associated with
   increasing rainfall over NWA. In the presence of increasing aerosols, a
   significant SST increase occurs in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean. As
   a result, the modeled rainfall increase in the presence of aerosol
   forcing is accounted for by these unrealistic relationships. It is not
   clear whether, in a model without such defects, the observed trend can
   be generated by increasing aerosols. Thus, the impact of aerosols on

Abstract = {A method was recently proposed for evaluating the impact of a
   perturbation, such as air pollution or urbanization, on the
   precipitation at a location by calculating the ratio between the
   precipitation at the perturbed location and that at a location believed
   to be unperturbed. However, this method may be inappropriate because of
   the high degree of variability of precipitation at each of the stations.
   To explore the validity of this approach, noisy annual rainfall records
   are generated numerically in an upwind, unperturbed station and in a
   downwind, perturbed station, and the time series of ratio between the
   annual rainfalls in the two stations is analyzed. The noisy rainfall
   records are 50 yr long, and the imposed trend for the downwind,
   perturbed station is -2 mm yr -1 while at the upwind station the
   variations in annual rainfall are purely noisy. Many pairs of noisy
   rainfall records are numerically generated (each pair constitutes an
   experiment), and in every experiment the slope of the linear best fit to
   the rainfall ratio yields an estimate of the trend of rainfall at the
   perturbed station. In the absence of noise, the trend of the rainfall
   ratio is explicitly related to the trend of rainfall at the perturbed
   station, but the natural rainfall variation at the stations completely
   masks this explicit relationship. The results show that in some
   experiments the trend line of the rainfall ratio has the opposite sign
   to the imposed trend and that in only about one-half of the experiments
   does the ratio's trend line lie within +/- 75\% of the imposed trend.
   Trend estimates within +/- 25\% of the imposed trend are obtained in
   less than one-quarter of the experiments. This result casts doubt on the
   generality and validity of using trends of rainfall ratio between two
   stations to estimate trends of precipitation in one of these stations.},

Title = {Decreasing trend in rainfall over Indochina during the late summer
   monsoon: Impact of tropical cyclones},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {86},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We examined the decreasing trend in rainfall during the late summer
   monsoon season (September) in Thailand from 1951 to 2000 and associated
   changes in tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Thailand receives significant
   rainfall from May to October and experiences two rainy peaks in late May
   to early June and in September. A previous study reported a decreasing
   trend in September rainfall in Thailand and, based on a regional climate
   model, suggested that the trend was associated with local deforestation.
   However, the long-term trend may also be affected by changes in
   large-scale circulation. Thus, the purpose of this study was to
   investigate changes in large-scale circulation associated with the
   decreasing rainfall trend.
   Westward-propagating TCs from the South China Sea and the western North
   Pacific brought most of the rainfall over Thailand in September. TCs
   include tropical depressions, tropical storms, severe tropical storms,
   typhoons, and residual lows. 70\% of the rainfall amount in September
   was estimated to be associated with TCs.
   The 50-year time-series of September rainfall over Thailand showed a
   significant decreasing trend. TC activity defined by 700-hPa relative
   vorticity, showed a weakening trend over the Indochina Peninsula. TC
   tracks also suggested the weakening of TC activity over this area. The
   long-term trend in rainfall during the late summer monsoon season was
   closely associated with changes in TC activity over the Indochina
   Peninsula; these changes were likely caused by changes in the major
   course of TCs. Concurrent with the changes in TC tracks, there was a
   change in the TC steering current around the Philippines archipelago and
   Taiwan. This led to the TC activity over the Indochina Peninsula being
   inactive, probably resulting in the long-term decrease in rainfall over
   Thailand.},

Title = {Why does rainfall affect the trend in soil carbon after converting
   pastures to forests? A possible explanation based on nitrogen dynamics},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},

Abstract = {When trees are planted onto former pastures, soil carbon stocks
   typically either remain constant or decrease, with decreases more common
   in regions with higher rainfall. We conducted a modelling analysis to
   assess whether those changes in soil carbon, especially the interaction
   with rainfall, could be understood through consideration of nitrogen
   balances. The study was based on simulations with the whole-system
   ecophysiological model CenW which allowed explicit modelling of both
   carbon and nitrogen pools and their fluxes through plants and soil
   organic matter.
   We found that in a modelled coniferous forest without excess water
   input, total system nitrogen stocks remained similar to pre-forestation
   values because there were few pathways for nitrogen losses, and without
   biological nitrogen fixation or fertiliser inputs, gains were restricted
   to small inputs from atmospheric deposition. However, tree biomass and
   the litter layer accumulated considerable amounts of nitrogen. This
   accumulation of nitrogen came at the expense of depleting soil nitrogen
   stocks. With the change from input of grass litter that is low in lignin
   to forest litter with higher lignin concentration, organic-matter C:N
   ratios increased so that more carbon could be stored per unit of soil
   nitrogen which partly negated the effect of reduced nitrogen stocks. The
   increase in C:N ratios was initially confined to the surface litter
   layer because of slow transfer of material to the mineral soil. Over a
   period of decades, soil C:N ratios eventually increased in the soil as
   well.
   Simulations with different amounts of precipitation showed that greater
   amounts of nitrogen were leached from systems where water supply
   exceeded the plants' requirements. Reduced nitrogen stocks then caused a
   subsequent reduction in soil organic carbon stocks. These simulations
   thus provided a consistent explanation for the observation of greater
   losses of soil organic carbon in high-rainfall systems after converting
   pastures to forests. More generally, the simulations showed that
   explicit modelling of the nitrogen cycle can put important constraints
   on possible changes in soil-carbon stocks that may occur after land-use
   change. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Trends in rainfall in the 35 years 1970-2004 have been calculated for
   all 350 available rainfall stations having sufficiently complete records
   that lie between latitudes 26-30. S and longitudes 150-154 degrees E.
   The area contains two major urban centers, Brisbane with a rapidly
   growing population approaching two million and the Gold Coast with a
   population of similar to 500 000. Statistically highly significant
   negative trends were found in the vicinity of Brisbane, with decreases
   exceeding 40\% of mean daily rainfall in the 35 years, and in a smaller
   area inland from the Gold Coast. The spatial distribution of trends was
   consistent with aerosol production from human activities, the prevailing
   winds and losses due to the topography. A previously published
   observation using satellite data showed that cloud properties were
   affected by urban aerosols in a way that is likely to reduce
   precipitation. The results of this study reinforce the suggestion made
   then that monitoring of aerosol concentrations and properties and
   in-situ observations of rain formation processes in the area should be
   undertaken as a matter of urgency.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of annual precipitation trends in Iran.
   Mean annual rainfalls were collected from 30 synoptic stations with a
   reasonable geographic distribution and with data equal to or less than
   50 years. Trend analysis was investigated using a ``regression line
   slope{''} method (annual rainfall as a dependent variable and year as an
   independent variable). The results showed that for the entire period,
   and at a 95\% level of significance, seven stations showed a negative
   trend, while a positive trend was found at six stations. The same data
   over the period of last 40 years demonstrated that four and 8 stations
   had negative and positive trends, respectively. Decreasing the record
   length, up to the last 30 years, resulted in fewer stations with any
   significant trend. The results identified that, in any case, the trend
   did not depend on the mean annual rainfall but rather record length
   could have some effects on it.},

Abstract = {Changes in catchment response as a result of climate change and/or
   variability continue to be of concern to hydrologists and water managers
   and thus identification and study of changes in rainfall as a major
   input into the hydrologic system remains pivotal in water resources
   management and planning for reliable input into modelling catchment
   response systems. An attempt has been made in this study to analyse
   long-term rainfall data obtained from five rain gauges (Kabompo,
   Kasempa, Mwinilunga, Mongu and Kaoma) located in the headstream regions
   of the Zambezi river basin in Zambia and to determine if these time
   series belonged to similar regime, have had any significant trends and
   if there was any homogeneity in trends among stations. To detect change
   in regime, the data were separately subjected to intervention analysis
   (using Cumulative Summation or CUSUM technique) and step change analysis
   (using rank-sum test) and subsequently the trend in each of the time
   series were determined using Mann-Kendall-statistic. The analyses
   undertaken to identify possibility of any intervention due to either
   natural and/or manmade causes, through the CUSUM technique, did not show
   signs of any major interventions except for Mongu station, where a
   change in regime was observed around 1980. This was even confirmed
   through step change analysis using the rank-sum test. Though the five
   stations showed marginal downward trends, these were not significant.
   Even, the test of homogeneity in trends observed at different stations
   showed homogeneity between them. Based on these findings, it was
   concluded that the rainfall data in the entire sub-basin belonged to a
   similar climate regime and the rainfall data for the entire period could
   be used for developing rainfall-response relationship except for Mongu,
   where the time series from 1981 onwards appear to have been subjected
   human/instrumental errors and needs to be investigated and updated. (c)

Abstract = {For better and sustainable output, timely and necessary input is the

   wise or quantity wise in the forth coming monsoon. Further, the trends
   of monsoon, onset, dry spell, wet spell, withdrawal, heavy to very heavy
   rain spells etc. are also completely unknown. Even with the latest
   developments in meteorological instruments, super computers satellite
   images, media communication the agricultural community is able to
   receive weather information 2-3 days in advance only but not well
   before. In this regard an attempt is made to establish a model for
   forecasting daily trend, of summer monsoon behavior well in advance in
   its due course from the onset to withdrawal phases. The model is very
   unconventional with respect to its input parameters.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Trends in rainfall indices from January 1910 to August 2005 were
   examined using an updated high-quality rainfall data-set from the
   Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Nine indices, reflecting changes to
   mean annual/seasonal rainfall and extreme daily rainfall (defined by the
   95th and 99th percentiles), were evaluated for six regions in the east
   and southwest of Australia. Seasonal and annual trends were calculated
   over two periods: long term (1910-2005) and medium term (19502005). In
   the Central region, since 1910 there have been significant increases in
   spring and annual rain days and extreme rainfall intensity (95th
   percentile), but significant decreases in spring and annual rain per
   rain day and the proportion of rainfall from extreme events. During
   spring, the Western Tablelands showed a decrease in rain per rain day
   over the period 1910-1930 and an increase over the period 1970-2005,
   most likely due to heavy-rain events. No significant changes were
   detected in the West region. In the Southwest, annual total rainfall has
   significantly decreased by 21 mm per decade since 1910 and by 24 mm per
   decade since 1950. These declines were accompanied by decreases in rain
   days and extreme rainfall indices. In the eastern Coastal region, since
   1950, there has been a significant decrease of almost 55 mm per decade
   in annual total rainfall, along with decreases in rain days and extreme
   rain, particularly in summer and winter. In the Southeast, a significant
   decrease in annual total rainfall of 20 rum per decade since 1950 stems
   mainly from decreases during autumn. Generally, the direction of changes
   in extreme rainfall is consistent with changes in the mean.},

Abstract = {Sorghum shoot bug, Peregrinus maidis (Ashmead) previously considered to
   be of minor importance, but now with the introduction of new sorghum
   genotypes of different maturity has become a serious pest. It was also
   reported as a vector of sorghum stripe disease (SStD). A roving survey
   was carried out for three years during post rainy season from 2004-05 to
   2006-07 in Bijapur district covering five talukas to assess its impact.
   The population of shoot bug varied from 20.51 to 26.34 per plant in
   different talukas of the district on farmer's fields mostly on M 35-1
   variety. Where as, on research farm comparatively higher population of
   36.34, 28.67 and 29.13 per plant was observed on M 35-1, DSV 4 and DSV 5
   varieties, respectively. The plants showing yellowing and stunted growth
   varied from 6.97 to 10.61 per cent on farmer's fields over the district.
   On research farm, it varied from 4.46 to 14.32 per cent on three ruling
   varieties. The plants showing girdling of top most leaves and poor
   panicle exertion ranged from 2.91 to 5.54 and 1.74 to 3.56 per cent,
   respectively on fanner's fields. On research farm, the plants showing
   girdling of top most leaves and poor panicle exertion ranged from 5.88
   to 7.26 and 3.48 to 4.84 per cent respectively and were little higher
   compared to farmer's fields. The overall stripe virus incidence and
   shoot bug damage ranged from 12.66 to 18.67 per cent over the district
   on farmer's field mostly on M 35-1 while on research farm, it was 26.42,
   19.52 and 13.82 per cent on M 35-1, DSV 4 and DSV 5 varieties,

Abstract = {Winter rainfall is a non-negligible issue for urban drainage in Canada
   as it can generate significant flooding, especially when it occurs at
   the same time as high air temperature and in the presence of all
   appreciable snow cover. According to climate change scenarios, it is
   expected that the occurrence of these events will increase in a fature
   climate. The purpose of this paper is to perform a trend analysis oil
   six indices related to winter rainfall (January-February) at 60 weather
   stations located in southern Quebec and New Brunswick (Canada) in order
   to detect possible trends in the frequency or intensity of winter
   rainfall events during the twentieth century. Datasets were provided by
   Environment Canada and come from the Canadian Daily Rehabilitated
   Precipitation Database. The bootstrap-based Mann-Kendall test is used to
   detect possible non-stationarities ill the dataset, while Sen's slope
   estimator is used to quantify the magnitude of the slope. Results show
   that 19 stations out of 60 present a significant trend (18 of them being
   positive) at a 5\% level for winter (Januaty-February) total rainfall.
   In most cases where a trend was detected for winter rainfall there was
   also all increase in the number of days with rainfall (42\% of the
   stations). These results suggest that globally, for the region under
   study, rainfall during January and February was more likely to occur,
   often resulting it? a significant increase in the total rainfall during
   these months. Increasing trends in maximum daily rainfall during January
   and February were also observed for 9 stations (15\% of the stations).
   The spatial distribution of stations where significant trends were
   detected is consistent with the hypothesis that trends in winter
   rainfall are more likely to be observed for stations located in the
   southern part of the region under study.},

Abstract = {Antelopes are prominent wildlife in Waza National Park, situated in
   Sahelo-Sudanian Cameroon, which has witnessed dramatic changes in
   rainfall and flooding. To assess their impacts, we reviewed 26 aerial
   and terrestrial surveys, comprising total, transect and localized
   counts. Estimated numbers of kob using the floodplain throughout the dry
   season, dropped from 20,000 in the 1960s and 1970s to 2000 in the
   mid-1980s. They recovered to 5000 in the mid-1990s but not further
   despite increased flooding. Estimated numbers of korrigum and roan using
   the floodplain later in the dry season, dropped in the early 1970s and
   only slightly recovered in the 1990s. The diversity of counting methods
   notwithstanding, the drop in kob numbers and the disappearance of
   waterbuck can be attributed to the construction of the Maga dam upstream
   in 1979 and subsequent low rainfall. The kob population structure
   suggests that its reproduction capacity was, however, not hit.
   Antelope-livestock contacts, provoking the transmission of diseases such
   rinderpest during droughts, explain better the dramatic drops in
   population numbers than poaching, which is likely to have remained
   rather constant. The effects of rainfall, flooding and human
   interventions on antelope populations increasingly appear to be
   interacting.},

Abstract = {An analysis of 22 sites of daily precipitation records over the period
   1951-2002 for the Iberian Peninsula is presented. Annual and seasonal
   total precipitation (P), number of wet days (N), precipitation intensity
   (I), the 95th percentile (P95), and percentage of rain falling on days
   with rainfall above the 95th percentile (\%) are investigated. The
   annual and seasonal trends for these variables and for all 22 rain
   gauges are analysed, using the Mann-Kendall statistic, and a linear
   regression model. Moreover, a t-test is applied to the difference
   between the means of two subperiods, respectively 1951-1976 and
   1977-2002. Principal results indicate a decreasing trend in P, I, and
   P95 for several northern and southern stations in winter: P, I. and P95
   in some southern stations in spring, I and P95 in some southern stations
   in summer, and I in some northern and southern stations in autumn. The
   general behaviour is a decrease in the daily intensity of rainfall,
   while the number of wet days does not reveal pronounced changes. This
   pattern is valid for both annual and seasonal values of the indices. The
   decreasing trend found for I in winter and annual series for some
   localities may be related to the predominance of the positive phase of
   the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but it is necessary to find other
   mechanisms for those stations and seasons not linked directly to NAO.

Abstract = {In this study trends in extreme rainfall over the Iberian Peninsula at a
   daily scale in the second half of the twentieth century have been
   detected and analyzed. For this goal 35 stations evenly distributed over
   the region of study covering the period 1958-97 have been studied. Two
   different approaches have been used. The first one consists of the
   nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and the Sen method. The second approach
   is based on the statistical theory of extreme values, involving
   time-dependent parameters in order to be able to reflect possible
   temporal changes in the frequency distribution. Results from both
   methods agree, confirming the reliability of the analysis. Negative
   trends are found for the west and southwest of the Iberian Peninsula in
   spring and winter. In autumn a spatial dipolar pattern appears, but
   trends are not so evident.},

Abstract = {Hydrological and hydraulic design and analysis is dependant on the
   probabilistic, risk and uncertainty analysis of hydrological events.
   Hydrological variables are traditionally treated as random and
   stationary with certain probability distributions. If changes in
   rainfall and flow patterns are evident, they will have significant
   impact on existing infrastructure, current practice and future
   strategies in flood defence and water resources management. Recent
   floods in England have triggered debate on the impact of climate change
   on floods. In this study, trend analyses were carried out on seasonal
   rainfall depth, mean flow and peak flow, and return period of peak flows
   over three distinctive catchments in South West England. It found that
   there are general trends of increased volume of rainfall and runoff in
   winter and slightly changed volume ( either in decrease or increase) of
   those in summer, which is in agreement with the current climatic model's
   simulation. However, the peak flows ( both annual and seasonal) across
   three catchments appear to move in opposite directions, indicating the
   change of rainfall patterns or/and anthropogenic activities in the
   region. This could have significant impact on hydrological design of
   water engineering structures in the future due to the disparity between
   the flood volume and peak. The paper also illustrated the change of the
   return periods of flow in the region and discussed its serious
   implications in existing and future hydraulic engineering projects},

Abstract = {A long-term (30 years) soybean-wheat experiment was conducted at
   Hawalbagh, Almora, India to study the effects of organic and inorganic
   sources of nutrients on grain yield trends of rainfed soybean (Glycine
   max)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) system and nutrient status (soil C, N, P
   and K) in a sandy loam soil (Typic Haplaquept). The unfertilized plot
   supported 0.56 Mg ha(-1) of soybean yield and 0.71 Mg ha(-1) of wheat
   yield (average yield of 30 years). Soybean responded to inorganic NPK
   application and the yield increased significantly to 0.87 Mg ha(-1) with
   NPK. Maximum yields of soybean (2.84 Mg ha(-1)) and residual wheat (1.88
   Mg ha(-1)) were obtained in the plots under NPK + farmyard manure (FYM)
   treatment, which were significantly higher than yields observed under
   other treatments. Soybean yields in the plots under the unfertilized and
   the inorganic fertilizer treatments decreased with time, whereas yields
   increased significantly in the plots under N + FYM and NPK + FYM
   treatments. At the end of 30 years, total soil organic C (SOC) and total
   N concentrations increased in all the treatments. Soils under NPK +
   FYM-treated plots contained higher SOC and total N by 89 and 58\% in the
   0-45 cm soil layer, respectively, over that of the initial status.
   Hence, the decline in yields might be due to decline in available P and
   K status of soil. Combined use of NPK and FYM increased SOC, oxidizable
   SOC, total N, total P, Olsen P, and ammonium acetate exchangeable K by
   37.8, 42.0, 20.8, 30.2, 25.0, and 52.7\%, respectively, at 0-45 cm soil
   layer compared to application of NPK through inorganic fertilizers.
   However, the soil profiles under all the treatments had a net loss of
   nonexchangeable K, ranging from 172 kg ha(-1) under treatment NK to a
   maximum of 960 kg ha(-1) under NPK + FYM after 30 years of cropping.
   Depletion of available P and K might have contributed to the soybean
   yield decline in treatments where manure was not applied. The study also
   showed that although the combined NPK and FYM application sustained
   long-term productivity of the soybean-wheat system, increased K input is
   required to maintain soil nonexchangeable K level.},

Abstract = {Against a backdrop of rising global surface temperature, the stability

   By using a daily rainfall data set, we show (i) significant rising

   (ii) a significant decreasing trend in the frequency of moderate events
   over central India during the monsoon seasons from 1951 to 2000. The
   seasonal mean rainfall does not show a significant trend, because the
   contribution from increasing heavy events is offset by decreasing
   moderate events. A substantial increase in hazards related to heavy rain
   is expected over central India in the future.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted from 1985-1986 to 2002-2003 on
   Vertisols under rainfed conditions to evaluate the effect of cropping
   systems and application of fertilizers and manure on seed cotton yield.
   To determine the long-term effects, trends and stability analyses were
   performed. Soil samples (0-0.15 and 0.15-0.30 m) were collected at the
   end of year 18 and analysed for available P and AB-DTPA extractable Zn.
   Among cropping systems, Asiatic diploid cotton (Gossypium arboreum)
   yielded 233 kg ha(-1) more seed cotton than the upland tetraploid cotton
   (Gossypium hirsutum). Yield trend was positive for G. arboreum compared
   with G. hirsutum. However, the slope was not significant. Stability
   analyses indicated overall higher yield stability for G. arboreum than
   G. hirsutum. Compared with monocropping G. hirsutum, G. hirsutum-sorghum
   (Sorghum bicolor L.) (H-S) rotation was significantly more stable. Soil
   samples (0-0.30 m) of the manure-amended plots had significantly greater
   P and Zn content (above the critical limit) compared to those receiving
   inorganic fertilizers alone. With regard to nutrient management
   practices, seed cotton yield was the highest for the integrated nutrient
   management (INM) treatment receiving a combination of organic and
   inorganic fertilizers. Among primary nutrients, the effect of P was
   significant while that of K was not. Balanced fertilizer application was
   significantly better than treatments receiving N and NK. Yield trends
   were, in general, not significant. However, a positive trend was noticed
   for treatments receiving manure compared to fertilizer alone. Stability
   analysis, on the other hand, indicated that the slopes were, in general,
   significant. Among the nutrients, mean yield response with and without P
   was 1007 and 672 kg ha(-1) respectively. Combined application of manure
   and fertilizer (INM) resulted in the highest mean yield response (1218
   kg ha(-1)) and the slope was highly significant (P < 0.004). In the
   manure-amended plots, a better nutrient status probably imparted a
   greater degree of yield stability. The present study suggests that
   compared to trend analysis, stability analysis being sensitive as it
   recognizes the treatment x environment interaction, is a better option
   to interpret results from long-term agronomic experiments.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increase in rainfall over northeast
   Brazil (Nordeste), while over the sub-Saharan region there has been a
   drought. The correlation coefficients between the 11-yr running means of
   the rainfall series over the two regions are significant ( at the 95\%
   confidence level by a two-sided t test), suggesting that both trends are
   related. The rainfall variations over the two regions are connected to
   the position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over the
   Atlantic. A more southward ( northward) position of the ITCZ is
   favorable for higher than normal rainfall over Nordeste (sub-Sahara).
   The correlation coefficient between the position of the ITCZ over the
   Atlantic and the rainfall over Nordeste (sub-Sahara) is negative (
   positive) and highly significant, reaching values over 0.9. Thus, this
   study suggests that a more southward than normal location of the ITCZ in
   the Atlantic may be the cause for the recent increasing ( decreasing)
   trend of rainfall over Nordeste (sub-Sahara).},

Title = {Trends in snowfall versus rainfall in the Western United States},

Abstract = {The water resources of the western United States depend heavily on
   snowpack to store part of the wintertime precipitation into the drier
   summer months. A well-documented shift toward earlier runoff in recent
   decades has been attributed to 1) more precipitation falling as rain
   instead of snow and 2) earlier snowmelt. The present study addresses the
   former, documenting a regional trend toward smaller ratios of
   winter-total snowfall water equivalent (SFE) to winter-total
   precipitation (P) during the period 1949-2004.
   The trends toward reduced SFE are a response to warming across the
   region, with the most significant reductions occurring where winter
   wet-day minimum temperatures, averaged over the study period, were
   warmer than -5 degrees C. Most SFE reductions were associated with
   winter wet-day temperature increases between 0 degrees and -3 degrees C
   over the study period. Warmings larger than this occurred mainly at
   sites where the mean temperatures were cool enough that the
   precipitation form was less susceptible to warming trends.
   The trends toward reduced SFE/P ratios were most pronounced in March
   regionwide and in January near the West Coast, corresponding to
   widespread warming in these months. While mean temperatures in March
   were sufficiently high to allow the warming trend to produce SFE/P
   declines across the study region, mean January temperatures were cooler,
   with the result that January SFE/P impacts were restricted to the lower
   elevations near the West Coast.
   Extending the analysis back to 1920 shows that although the trends
   presented here may be partially attributable to interdecadal climate
   variability associated with the Pacific decadal oscillation, they also
   appear to result from still longer-term climate shifts.},

Abstract = {Annual rainfall series and annual base flow series (1954-1998) derived
   from the annual river flow series for the Mulunguzi river in Malawi were
   analysed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Pettit and
   Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistics to detect any trends and variability
   patterns. A general decline in rainfall, with alternating wet and drier
   years was detected since 1954. The variation pattern mainly followed the
   El Nino and Southern Oscillation and the La Nina episodes. Two rainfall
   change points were detected at 1965 and 1979 after which the rainfall
   declined.
   The rainfall trend and variation pattern was evident in the base flow
   series, indicating a strong correlation between the rainfall and base
   flow series. This strong correlation means that the Zomba mountain
   aquifer, the Source of the Mulunguzi river mainly depends on rainfall
   for recharge. Hence all water resources development and planning
   activities in the catchment area should take into consideration the
   effects of climate variability oil water yield. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract = {To more fully understand the role of precipitation in observed increases
   in freshwater discharge to the Arctic Ocean, data from a new archive of
   bias-adjusted precipitation records for the former USSR (TD9813), along
   with the CRU and Willmott-Matsuura data sets, were examined for the
   period 1936-1999. Across the six largest Eurasian river basins, snowfall
   derived from TD9813 exhibits a strongly significant increase until the
   late 1950s and a moderately significant decrease thereafter. A strongly
   significant decline in derived rainfall is also noted. Spatially,
   snowfall increases are found primarily across north-central Eurasia, an
   area where the rainfall decreases are most prominent. Although no
   significant change is determined in Eurasian-basin snowfall over the
   entire 64 year period, we note that interpolation from early, uneven
   station networks causes an overestimation of spatial precipitation, and
   that the local snowfall trends determined from gridded TD9813 data are
   likely underestimated. Yet, numerous uncertainties in historical Arctic
   climate data and the sparse, irregular nature of Arctic station networks
   preclude a confident assessment of precipitation-discharge linkages
   during the period of reported discharge trends.},

Abstract = {The feared global climate change could have important effects on various
   environmental variables including rainfall in many countries around the
   world. Changes in precipitation regime directly affect water resources
   management, agriculture, hydrology and ecosystems. For this reason it is
   important to investigate the changes in the spatial and temporal
   rainfall pattern in order to improve water management strategies.
   In this study a non-parametric statistical method (Mann-Kendall rank
   correlation method) is employed in order to verify the existence of
   trend in annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall and the distribution of
   the rainfall during the year. This test is applied to about 250 rain
   gauge stations in Sicily (Italy) after a series of procedures finalized
   to the estimation of missing records and to the verification of data
   consistency.
   In order to understand the regional pattern of precipitation in Sicily,
   the detected trends are spatially interpolated using spatial analysis
   techniques in a GIS environment.
   The results show the existence of a generalized negative trend for the
   entire region. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Throughfall volumes and incident rainfall were measured between 23
   August and 2 December 2004 as well as from 6 January to 15 April 2005
   for individual rain events of differing intensities and magnitudes in an
   open tropical rainforest in Rondonia, Brazil. Temporal patterns of
   throughfall spatial variability were examined. Estimated interception
   was compared to modeled interception obtained by applying the revised
   Gash model in order to identify sources of throughfall variability in
   open tropical rainforests.
   Gross precipitation of 97 events amounted to 1309 mm, 89 +/- 5.6\%
   (S.E.) of which reached the forest floor as throughfall. The
   redistribution of water within the canopy was highly variable in time,
   which we attribute to the high density of babassu palms (Orbignya
   phalerata), their seasonal leaf growth, and their conducive morphology.
   We identified a 10-min rainfall intensity threshold of 30 mm h(-1) above
   which interception was highly variable. This variability is amplified by
   funneling and shading effects of palms. This interaction between a
   rainfall variable and vegetation characteristics is relevant for
   understanding the hydrology of all tropical rainforests with a high palm
   density.},

Abstract = {Two parallel methods, Higuchi and consecutive differences, for
   calculating fractal dimension (FD) of temporal data series, were applied
   to accumulated rainfall, recorded in Pastaza Province, Ecuador and
   Veneto Province, Italy. Both series were recorded regularly, each month,
   for over 30 years (January 1974 - September 2005). In order to calculate
   their FD time dependence, DF(t), moving windows of different lengths (10
   - 350 samples) were applied. Presence of fractal oscillations (> 1.67
   year periods), was detected by applying FFT on detrended FD(t), obtained
   with short windows (10-20 samples). Long-term FD(t) trends were studied
   using long windows (100 - 300, optimal - 200 samples). Both methods
   detected identical (or very similar) rhythms of FD(t) in the two data
   series, but the intercontinental frequencies differed: 4.4 years
   dominating in Ecuadorian, 10.3 years in Italian data. A linear positive
   trend of fractal dimension values (1.93 to 1.99), with a significant
   slope, was obtained for the Ecuadorian data over the whole recorded
   period. Italian rainfall fractal trend profile was, however,
   characterized by two phases: a constant high value (- 1.99) for the
   period 1974 - 1993, followed by a linear decrease (1.99 to 1.95) for
   1993 - 2005. Trend results, obtained with two different methods, were
   also in accordance. Whether, and to what extent, the 4.4 years
   oscillation in the Ecuadorian fractal values could be associated with
   the ENSO phenomenon, similarly the 10.3 years rhythm in Veneto fractal
   rainfall with the solar activity, remains to be explored, perhaps by
   analyzing corresponding data from other European and South American
   locations. Accordance of the results, reported in the present paper by
   applying two different methods, validates their use as a tool in future
   firactal measurements.},

Abstract = {Up until today extreme rainfall properties are frequently applied in
   sewer design guidelines. Uncertainty in the estimation of such
   properties will hence directly influence the dimensions of sewers,

   noise in the estimation is investigated for 6 rain series ranging from
   19 to 55 years in duration. Different to recent research that predicts a
   - climate induced-increase in heavy precipitation no clear indication
   for such trend was found in the investigated historical rain series.
   Another important aspect is the length of the rain series that is
   required for the estimation of extreme rainfall properties and the
   associated uncertainty. The analysis indicates that at least a period of
   10 years should be used for the estimation. But even so the possible
   deviation expressed in terms of the 90 percentile is in the order of 5
   to 10\% of the `true value', defined as the value derived when the whole

Abstract = {Since the 18th century systematic measurements of rainfall have been
   collected in Italy. The daily rainfall series observed in Milan
   (1835-2001), Genoa (1833-2000), Bologna (1813-2001) and Palermo
   (1797-1999) are examples of available long rainfall records. These data
   series can help analyzing the evolution of precipitation. The present
   paper deals with long term evolution of. (i) annual rainfall amount;
   (ii) annual number of rainy events; (iii) intensity of rainfall, (iv)
   inter-annual rainfall partitioning, i.e. the duration of wet and dry
   periods, and (v) maximum annual values of daily rainfall amount,
   duration of wet and dry periods. The evolution is studied analyzing the
   first two order statistics and the 30-year return period quantiles via
   moving window analysis. Confidence intervals are introduced to check the
   statistical significance of the estimated statistics and quantiles. The
   results are compared with those provided by the traditional Mann-Kendall
   test. The analysis shows how the annual precipitation exhibits a
   negative trend in the first half of 20th century, with a subsequent
   positive trend in northern Italy (Genoa, Milan and Bologna). Conversely,
   the dataset for Palermo (southern Italy) displays only a negative trend.
   Because the number of precipitation episodes is found to decrease in the
   investigated period, the average rain rate is significantly increasing
   especially in northern Italy. This is also associated with shorter
   duration of rain episodes with an evident effect on rainfall extremes.
   Dry periods tend to be longer with increasing variability. The
   Mann-Kendall test and its progressive form have shown to be well suited
   for monotonic trend, but the confidence interval analysis, introduced
   here, is more appropriate if oscillations are significant. (c) 2005

Abstract = {The U.S. Geological Service Great Lakes Science Center has archived
   rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) collected from the early 1980s to the
   present. These fish were collected to provide time- and site-dependent
   contaminant residue data needed by researchers and managers to fill
   critical data gaps regarding trends and behavior of persistent organic
   contaminants in the Great Lakes ecosystem. In the present study, data
   are presented for concentrations of several organochlorine (OC)
   contaminants in the archived smelt, including DDT, polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), toxaphene, and chlordanes in Lakes Michigan and Huron
   (ML USA) and in Lake Superior (MN, USA). The trends for all the OCs were
   declining as a first-order decay over the sampled time series
   (1983/1985-1993/1999) with the exception of toxaphene in Lake Superior
   and PCBs at the Charlevoix/Little Traverse Bay site in Lake Michigan.
   Concentration of the emerging contaminant, polybrominated diphenyl
   ethers (PBDEs), also was traced from its apparent entry into this
   ecosystem in approximately 1980 until 1999. Time trends for the PBDEs
   were increasing exponentially at all sites, with concentration-doubling
   times varying from 1.58 to 2.94 years.},

Abstract = {Progress in the Finnish breeding programme for rainbow trout was
   assessed by estimating genetic trends in growth, maturity age and
   skeletal deformations and by calculating rates of inbreeding and
   additive genetic relationships. The analysis included two pedigreed
   populations with three generations and over 117,000 individuals recorded
   for skeletal deformations, growth and age at maturity. Because the
   breeding station is located in fresh water but sea is the main
   production environment, each family was split into subgroups to be
   tested for performance either in fresh or sea water. Estimation of
   breeding values across the generations showed that multitrait selection
   has produced an average of 7\% genetic gain per generation in fresh and
   sea water growth of market-sized fish. In the population with high
   frequency of early maturing males, phenotypic culling of early maturing
   males has prevented an increase in the frequency of early maturing fish.
   In the other population, the frequency of early maturing females has
   increased, the genetic change being unfavourable. Weak favourable or no
   correlated genetic changes were observed in the frequency of
   deformations in response to selection for the production traits. Rate of
   inbreeding has remained low, the maximum value being 0.7\% per
   generation. Because mating of close relatives has been avoided, an
   increase in coefficient of additive genetic relationships describes the
   risk of the programme more realistically than rate of inbreeding. The
   average increase in relationship was 0.7\% per generation, a value below
   the suggested precaution level. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Nineteen coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models

   that four models produced mean annual rainfall distributions closely
   resembling climatological means and all four models had normalized root
   mean square errors well within the bounds of observed variability. East
   African (10 degreesN - 20 degreesS, 25degrees - 50 degreesE) rainfall
   data from transient 80 year experiments which featured CO2 increases of
   1\% per year were compared with 80 year control simulations. Results
   indicate enhanced annual and seasonal rainfall rates, and increased
   extreme wet period frequency. These results indicate that East Africa
   may face a future in which mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and
   Rift Valley fever proliferate resulting from increased CO2.},

Abstract = {The long-term trends of heavy rainfall in South Africa were analysed
   using the annual maximum rainfalls of 1-7 days duration of 786
   representative rainfall series. Using the Mann-Kendall

   of the annual maxima at the 90\% significance level while only 9.5\%
   indicated a significant reduction. The Mann-Kendall magnitude-of-trend
   test identified overall average increases of annual maxima ranging from
   0.087 to 0.126 mm, year(-1). A comparison of the mean of the first and
   the second half of each series obtained average increases varying from
   13.0 to 15.2 \% over durations that averaged to 58 years. This study
   reveals that annual maxima of 1-7 day duration have been increasing in

Abstract = {Since the mid 1970s, the number of days with westerly atmospheric
   circulations has strongly increased during winter months. As a
   consequence, rainfall totals, rainfall event duration and intensity have
   been subject to significant positive trends throughout the Mosel river
   basin. However, the trends identified through the non-parametrical test
   named Kendall's tau have shown to be spatially varying. The intensity of
   the trends appears to be directly linked to orographic obstacles that
   are well known to have a strong influence on average rainfall totals. A
   direct consequence of the changes having affected winter rainfall under
   westerly atmospheric circulations on the one hand and the spatial
   variability of these changes on the other hand, is a spatially varying
   positive trend in maximum winter streamflow. Thus, even though a clear
   large-scale change has affected winter rainfall over the past decades,
   its intensity is either strongly moderated or enhanced by orographic
   obstacles. The related changes in streamflow are directly dependent on
   the spatial variability of the changed rainfall characteristics.},

Abstract = {In recent years a new perspective has been added to India's hydrological
   and water resources research with the formulation of the Master Plan
   ``Interbasin Water Transfer-Interlinking of Rivers of India{''}. The
   issue of rainfall fluctuations over and across the country needs to be
   addressed amicably in the planning process of the programme. Using
   highly quality-controlled data from 316 widely distributed raingauge
   stations, spatiotemporal features of annual, seasonal and monthly
   rainfall for the whole of India and its I I major and 31 (including west
   coast drainage) minor river basins are reported in this paper. Spatial
   features of the rainfall for the whole country were studied by examining
   expansion/contraction of rainfall zones under specified rainfall
   conditions over the period 1871-2001. Broadly, from around the 1940s, a
   westward shift, larger variability and declining tendency is seen in the
   rainfall over the country. To understand temporal features across the
   country, basin-scale area-averaged rainfall series (1813-2001) have been
   subjected to time series analysis. Basins in central India (Sabarmati,
   Mahi, Narmada, Tapi, Godavari and Mahanadi) have been experiencing
   reduced rainfall from about the 1960s, while in others-Indus from 1954,
   Ganga from 1993, Brahmaputra from 1988, Krishna from 1953 and Cauvery
   from 1929-there has been an upward trend in rainfall. The recent trend
   in rainfall across India is believed to be due to global warming; a
   possible mechanism is suggested.},

Abstract = {Trends in Australian rainfall over the period 1901 to 2002 are analysed
   with the aim of evaluating and assessing long-term trends. In
   particular, this study examines long-term trends in Australian rainfall
   with the aim of identifying any continental-scale patterns that could be
   described as `unusual'. All-Australia annual average rainfall and
   all-Australia average decile time series indicate a positive long-term
   trend over the full period. Trend maps indicate that much of this trend
   is the result of increases in summer half-year rainfall over western,
   northern and central Australia that have occurred over the latter part
   of the record 1952-2002. While significant negative trends in winter
   half-year rainfall over southwest Western Australia are evident. there
   is little evidence that they are part of any continental-scale trends,
   at least not on 100 or 50-year time-scales. Empirical Orthogonal
   Teleconnection patterns (EOTs) of annual rainfall provide a means for
   delineating independent spatial modes. These indicate that much of the
   variance in all-Australian rainfall can be attributed to the first two
   modes that cover much of central eastern Australia and central western
   Australia. In addition.. the pattern of positive trends comprises at
   least two modes. which, being linearly independent, indicate that the
   large-scale pattern of increases is itself unusual in a historical
   context.},

Abstract = {The present work studies the trends in rainfall and the behaviour of dry
   spells along a pluviometric gradient representative of the conditions of
   the Mediterranean region. The region is characterized by a marked water
   deficit in the summer, a pronounced irregularity in its rainfall regime,
   and a noteworthy frequency of dry spells or periods without appreciable
   rainfall. The results obtained confirm the general previsions of the
   IPCC, with a predominance of dry years over wet ones and a negative
   rainfall trend in the central sector. An increase in intra-annual
   variability in rainfall, and a very pronounced occurrence of dry periods
   independent of the total annual rainfall, are also seen. These
   circumstances will potentially increase the vulnerability of several
   Mediterranean ecosystems located along the gradient that are currently
   subject to considerable pressure from human activities; this will
   increase the environmental problems of these zones
   (agro-forestry-grazing productivity, soil degradation, recharge of
   aquifers, forest fires, runoff models, biological diversity and
   composition, etc.). (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A statistical method, based on the idea of analogous synoptic
   situations, is used to study the observed rainfall trends in the SW of
   Western Australia. The method has been developed and optimised by
   relating patterns of atmospheric fields (predictors) to station records
   of rainfall (predictands), for both rain occurrences and daily rain
   amounts. When tested on observational data, the analogue method is able
   to reproduce the trend observed globally during the past 50 yr, showing
   the sensitivity of the statistical approach to changed climatic
   conditions. The choice of predictor has an important impact on the
   results: mean sea level pressure (MSLP) and vertically integrated
   precipitable water (PWTR) are both important in explaining the observed
   local rainfall trend. The model is then applied to 3 coupled models'
   simulations of the current climate. The improvement gained when using
   the statistical downscaling tool over direct model grid-average outputs
   is substantial, Most of the model biases are removed and realistic
   probability distribution functions at the station level are obtained.
   The method is then applied to altered climate conditions; the impact of
   model sensitivities on large-scale responses is quantified using the
   various coupled models. Future trends for rainfall, estimated by direct
   climate model outputs, are compared with downscaled projections. A
   general agreement is found; uncertainties are smaller amongst
   projections when the downscaling technique is used. All projections
   agree on a mean reduction of total rainfall in winter and spring. The
   possible impact of future drying trends induced by global warming is
   compounded by changes in mean and extreme rainfall, such as long wet
   spells and large yearly totals.},

Abstract = {An analysis of decadal and long-term patterns of rainfall has been
   carried out using a combination of raingauge and gridded rainfall
   datasets, for the entire Amazon basin and for its northern and southern
   sub-basins. The study covers the period 1929-98. Rainfall variability
   and variations in circulation and sea surface temperature fields have
   been analysed in more detail for the period 1950-98. Negative rainfall
   trends were identified for the entire Amazon basin, while at the
   regional level there is a negative trend in northern Amazonia and
   positive trend in southern Amazonia. Decadal time scale variations in
   rainfall have been discovered, with periods of relatively drier and
   wetter conditions, with different behaviour in northern and southern
   Amazonia. Spectral analyses show decadal time scale variations in
   southern Amazonia, while northern Amazonia exhibits both interannual and
   decadal scale variations. Shifts in the rainfall regime in both sections
   of the Amazon basin were identified as occurring in the mid-1940s and
   1970s. After 1975-76, northern Amazonia received less rainfall than
   before 1975. Changes in the circulation and oceanic fields after 1975
   suggest an important role of the warming of the tropical central and
   eastern Pacific on the decreasing rainfall in northern Amazonia, due to
   more frequent and intense El Nino events during the relatively dry
   period 1975-98.},

Abstract = {We present an analysis of the mean climate and climatic trends of
   tropical rainforest regions over the period 1960-1998, with the aid of
   explicit maps of forest cover and climatological databases. Until the
   mid-1970s most regions showed little trend in temperature, and the
   western Amazon experienced a net cooling probably associated with an
   interdecadal oscillation. Since the mid-1970s, all tropical rainforest
   regions have experienced a strong warming at a mean rate of 0.26 +/-
   0.05 degreesC per decade, in synchrony with a global rise in temperature
   that has been attributed to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. Over
   the study period, precipitation appears to have declined in tropical
   rainforest regions at a rate of 1.0 +/- 0.8\% per decade (p < 5\%),
   declining sharply in northern tropical Africa (at 3-4\% per decade),
   declining marginally in tropical Asia and showing no significant trend
   in Amazonia. There is no evidence so far of a decline in precipitation
   in eastern Amazonia, a region thought vulnerable to
   climate-change-induced drying. The strong drying trend in Africa
   suggests that this should be a priority study region for understanding
   the impact of drought on tropical rainforests. We develop and use a
   dry-season index to study variations in the length and intensity of the
   dry season. Only African and Indian tropical rainforests appear to have
   seen a significant increase in dry-season intensity. In terms of
   interannual variability, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the
   primary driver of temperature variations across the tropics and of
   precipitation fluctuations for large areas of the Americas and southeast
   Asia. The relation between ENSO and tropical African precipitation
   appears less direct.},

Abstract = {An attempt has been made to investigate decadal-scale trends in
   Australian rainfall and in the southern oscillation index (SOI) and
   their influence on the relationship between them. Monthly rainfall data
   from high-quality stations in Australia (from 1900 to 1995), India, Sri
   Lanka and Tahiti are used. The relationship between the SOI and
   Australian rainfall is positive, but shows decadal-scale variations
   during the past century. Although there were extended and severe El Nino
   events in the early 1990s and in 1997, Australia did not experience the
   expected severe rainfall deficiencies characteristic of previous events.
   However, severe drought conditions over eastern Australia were
   associated with a moderate El Nino event during 2002-03.
   Long-term fluctuations of March-May (MAM) rainfall show high-frequency
   variations, but trends during June-August (JJA), September-November
   (SON) and December-February (DJF) show low-frequency or decadal-scale
   variations. Trends and multi-decadal fluctuations in all-Australian
   spring (SON) and summer (DJF) rainfall are strongly dominated by
   rainfall trend fluctuations in northern and eastern Australia. Austral
   summer rainfall shows an increasing trend during the 1980s and 1990s,
   particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, despite the occurrence
   of extended and severe El Ninos. However, some parts of New South Wales
   and Queensland experienced severe rainfall deficiencies during 2002-03
   in conjunction with an El Nino event.
   The relationship between the SOI and rainfall on the interannual time
   scale is strong when the SOI and rainfall follow the same direction, but
   it is weak when they follow opposite directions on a decadal-time scale.
   The poor correlation during the 1920s and 1930s was due to a slightly
   increasing trend in the SOI and a stronger decreasing trend in rainfall.
   A weakening in the relationship between the SOI and rainfall in recent
   years, after the mid-1970s, is due to a small increase in rainfall in
   the 1980s and 1990s and a strong decrease in the SOL Rainfall trends
   were enhanced (stronger decreases or increases) when the influence of
   the SOI (or El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO)) was removed. Enhanced A
   increases and decreases are particularly strong during SON and DJF, when
   the ENSO phenomenon is at the mature stage and also the influence on
   Australian rainfall is strong. The increasing trend in rainfall during
   the 1980s and 1990s in some parts of eastern Australia and the
   decreasing trend in the SOI result in more rainfall for a given SOI
   compared with the same SOI during the previous period, i.e. before the
   mid-1970s. A similar analysis was carried out for two periods, before
   and after 1972, for Tahiti, India and Sri Lanka. The upward or downward
   shift in regression lines is very clear during the season, that shows a
   strong relationship between rainfall and the SOL Moreover, strengthening
   or weakening of the relationship between rainfall and the SOI is largely
   dependent on their multi-decadal variations and trends during the past
   century.
   Increases in rainfall during the 1980s and the 1990s and decreases in
   the SOI have weakened their relationship, both in Australia and India.
   Such a relationship gives more rainfall for a given SOI after 1973. The
   pattern was reversed for Sri Lanka. where rainfall during the second
   intermonsoon season has decreased. Analyses of trends in temperature at
   Darwin and Tahiti and of rainfall over Australia, India, Tahiti and Sri
   Lanka suggest a regional-scale change in climate, whereas the SOI
   reflects a change in the large-scale circulation pattern over the
   Indo-Pacific region after the mid-1970s. Copyright (C) 2004 Royal

Abstract = {This paper describes an analysis of long-term rainfall trends in central
   mountainous region of Sri Lanka. A 30-year 60 rain gauge data set is
   analyzed to identify the trends in annual and seasonal rainfall.
   Inter-annual as well as intra-annual rainfall trends are investigated to
   understand the adverse impacts on water resources, floods and land
   degradation. It is found that there is a decrease in the annual rainfall
   in the region. while different seasons show mixed results. The
   March-April 1st inter-monsoon period shows the highest decrease in
   rainfall where almost all the rain gauges have recorded decreasing
   rainfall. In addition to the decreasing rainfall trend. the numbers of
   rainy days have reduced giving rise to an increasing rain intensity
   trend. In order to understand better the changes to rain
   intensity-frequency relation, a universal multifractal analysis was
   carried out where multifractal models calibrated to first and last
   decades of the rain series are used to estimate the intensity-frequency
   relations in the rainfall series. The results show that there is a
   decrease of inter-monsoon rainfall, while the intensities and return
   period of extreme events appear to become shorter. These changes could
   be associated with regional climate changes, and are consistent with
   projections related to Asia Brown Cloud phenomena. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {Information on intensity-duration-frequency of rainfall is commonly
   required for a variety of hydrologic applications. In this study, trends
   are estimated for different durations of annual extreme rainfall using
   the regional average Mann-Kendall S trend test. The method of L-moments
   was employed to delineate homogeneous regions. The trend test was
   modified to account for observed autocorrelation, and a bootstrap
   methodology was used to account for the observed spatial correlation.
   Numerical analysis was performed on 44 rainfall stations from the
   province of Ontario, Canada, for a 20 year time frame. This was done
   using data from homogeneous regions established using the L-moments
   procedure for the annual maximum observations for the following
   durations: 5, 10, 15 and 30 min, and 1, 2, 6 and 12 h. Depending on
   different rainfall durations, four or five homogeneous regions were
   delineated.
   Based on a 5\% significance level, approximately 23\% of the regions
   tested had a significant trend, predominantly for short-duration storms.
   Serial dependency was observed in 2.3\% of data sets and spatial
   correlation was found in 18\% of the regions. The presence of serial and
   spatial correlation had a significant impact on trend determination.

   the average and variability of rainfall at those locations and to
   examine the recent rainfall trend by application of the first regression
   analysis. The rainfall trend, expressed as a regression coefficient of
   the first regression equation, was only significant at some locations,
   but the positive rainfall trend was identified at locations in Peninsula
   Thailand, whereas the negative rainfall trend was indicated for
   locations in Sumatra and Java Islands of Indonesia. At locations under
   tropical to subtropical monsoon climate, the significant trends in the
   annual and seasonal rainfall were hardly indicated, but the large annual
   variability of rainfall was observed in the dry-season.},

Title = {Trends in extreme daily rainfall across the South Pacific and

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {23},
Number = {8},
Pages = {847-869},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Daily rainfall records from 22 high-quality stations located in the
   South Pacific were analysed, over the common period 1961-2000, in order
   to assess whether extreme rainfall events have altered in their
   frequency or magnitude. A comprehensive spatial coverage across the
   South Pacific was provided, analysing a range of indices of extreme
   precipitation, which reflect both high rainfall events and drought.
   Clear spatial patterns emerged in the trends of extreme rainfall
   indices, with a major discontinuity across the diagonal section of the
   South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ).
   Stations located between 180 and 155degreesW exhibit a greater number of
   significant abrupt changes in extreme climate than elsewhere in the
   South Pacific and the majority of climatic jumps occur in the 1970s or
   1980s (coincident with a displacement northeastward of the diagonal part
   of the SPCZ and a large local increase in mean annual temperature).
   Notably, all significant abrupt changes in an extreme rainfall intensity
   index occurred in the late 1970s or early 1980s, and in every case the
   index showed an increase in extremity following the change point,
   regardless of station location. For the stations located south of the
   SPCZ, this may also be linked to the observed warming since the 1970s.
   Significant abrupt changes in mean precipitation were also identified
   around the mid 1940s, for two longer, century-scale records, which again
   correspond to a major displacement of the diagonal section of the SPCZ.
   An indicator of the diagonal SPCZ position is significantly temporally
   correlated with an extreme rainfall intensity index, at two locations
   either side of the diagonal section of the SPCZ, at decadal time scales
   or longer. This suggests that the displacement of the diagonal portion
   of the SPCZ on decadal time scales influences not only mean
   precipitation, but also daily rainfall extremes. Copyright (C) 2003

Abstract = {Rainfall, like all other natural phenomena is highly unpredictable.
   Traditionally, principal component analysis and spectral analysis are
   used to understand trends in rainfall over long periods. In this paper,
   we present a new method that appears to be better than existing methods
   to understand the long-term behavior of rainfall phenomena. Using a case
   study on the rainfall in Kerala State, the southern part of Indian
   Peninsula, we show that a new kind of neural network known as the
   adaptive basis function network is a promising tool for climatic
   studies, especially rainfall analysis. The paper also reveals that in
   spite of the fluctuations resulting from the nonlinearity in the system,
   the trends in the rainfall pattern in Kerala state have remained
   unaffected over the past 87 years from 1893 to 1980. We also
   successfully filter out the chaotic part of the system and illustrate
   that its effects are marginal over long-term predictions. (C) 2002

Abstract = {1 Past work on tropical rain forest tree seedlings has been dominated by
   contrasts between strongly light-demanding and strongly shade-tolerant
   species. We examined patterns of growth and mortality among
   shade-tolerant tree seedlings in response to light, and investigated the
   morphological and physiological correlates of high seedling growth and
   survival rates across species.
   2 Seedlings of 15 tree species from Australian tropical lowland forest
   were grown for up to 1 year in neutral-density shadehouses at three
   light levels (10\%, 0.8\% and 0.2\% full daylight). All species showed
   negligible mortality in the 10\% and 0.8\% shadehouses, but survival was
   significantly reduced in 0.2\% daylight.
   3 Seedling survival rate in 0.2\% daylight showed no significant
   relationship with either the dry mass of seed reserves (embryo plus
   endosperm), or relative growth rates in dry mass (RGR(M) ) in 0.8\% and
   10\% light.
   4 The RGR(M) values in 0.8\% and 10\% daylight were strongly positively
   correlated, and showed a strong negative correlation with the dry mass
   of seed reserves. Interspecific variation in low-light RGR(M) was driven
   by unit leaf rate (rate of accumulation of dry mass per unit area of
   leaf), whereas interspecific variation in high-light RGR(M) was most
   closely correlated with leaf area ratio (leaf area per total plant dry
   mass).
   5 Variation in seedling characters in response to light may have
   important implications for the coexistence of shade-tolerant tropical
   tree species.},

Abstract = {We have analyzed daily rainfall trends throughout the second half of the
   20(th) century in the western Mediterranean basin (Valencia Region, E of
   Spain). The area is characterized by high torrentiality, and during the
   second half of the 20(th) century some of the highest daily rainfall
   values in the Mediterranean basin have been recorded. In this area, mean
   annual rainfall varies between 500 and 300 mm and is overwhelmingly
   dependent on just a few days of rain. Daily maximum rainfall varies on
   average from 120 mm day(-1) to 50 mm day(-1), and represents a mean of
   17\% (coastland) to 9\% (inland) of annual rainfall. The 10 days in each
   year with the heaviest rainfall (called ``higher events{''}) provide
   over 50\% of the annual rainfall and can reach more than 400 mm on
   average. We compared the annual rainfall trend and the trend of higher
   and minor events defined by percentiles, both in volume and variability.
   We, therefore, tested whether annual rainfall changes depend on the
   trend of the higher (rainfall) events.
   To overlap spatial distribution of trends (i.e.: positive, no
   significant and negative trends) we have used cross-tab analysis. The
   results confirm the hypothesis that annual rainfall changes depend on
   changes found in just a few rainy events. Furthermore, in spite of their
   negative trend, higher events have increased their contribution to
   annual rainfall.
   As a consequence, although torrential events may have diminished in
   magnitude, future scenarios seem to be controlled by a limited number of
   rainy events which will become more and more variable year on year. The
   high spatial density of data used in this work, (97 observatories per
   24.000 km(2), overall mean 1 observatory per 200 km(2)), suggests to us
   that extreme caution should be applied when analyzing regional and
   sub-regional changes in rainfall using GCM output, especially in areas
   of high torrentiality.},

Abstract = {Since the first democratic elections of 1994, South Africans are
   popularly known as the `rainbow people'. The paper reports the
   acceptance of the rainbow as political symbol of unity among the diverse
   people of South Africa at three times: Immediately after the 1994
   elections, two years later in 1996, and five years later in 1999 after
   the second general elections. The database for the study are responses
   to items placed with a syndicated national survey conducted countrywide.
   The public discourse on the rainbow is reviewed through personal
   interviews with a panel of 25 elites contacted in the run-up to the
   second general elections. The researchers revisit conclusions based on
   the earlier results (Moller, Dickow and Harris, 1999). The third round
   of research finds that the appeal of the rainbow as political symbol has
   waned but is still inclusive of all groups in society. Projections of
   national pride have shifted from the rainbow as symbol of unity and
   reconciliation to other icons of achievement such as the Reconstruction
   and Development Programme and prowess in sport. Support for the
   political symbolism of the rainbow is positively associated with
   happiness, life satisfaction and optimism. Lack of a focus of national
   pride is associated with pessimism. Results support the conclusion
   reached earlier that belief in the `rainbow nation' ideal boosts
   optimism and promotes happiness during South Africa's transition to a
   stable democracy, thereby preventing alienation among the losers under
   the new political dispensation. Linkages between acceptance of the
   rainbow symbol, subjective well-being and optimism are discussed in the
   light of the socio-political changes which have taken place in South
   Africa since democracy.},

Abstract = {An atmospheric global climate model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model
   is used to study changes in tropical rainfall due to the indirect
   effects of anthropogenic sulfate aerosol. The model is run to
   equilibrium for present-day (PD) and preindustrial (PI) sulfur emission
   scenarios. As in two other recent studies, the model generally gives a
   southward shift of tropical rainfall in the PD run relative to the PI
   run. This is largely due to a hemispheric asymmetry in the reduction of
   sea surface temperature (SST) induced by the perturbation of cloud
   albedo and lifetime.
   Observed precipitation trends over land for the period 1900-98 show a
   complex pattern in the Tropics, but when zonally averaged, a southward
   shift similar to (but weaker than) the modeled shift is clearly evident.
   The zonally averaged tropical trends are significant at the 5\% level in
   several latitude bands. The modeled present-day hemispheric contrast in
   cloud droplet effective radius (which affects cloud albedo) is well
   supported by one long-term satellite retrieval, but not by another. A
   third satellite retrieval, which only covers an 8-month period, does
   show a marked hemispheric contrast in effective radius.
   Both in the modeled changes and the observed trends, a prominent feature
   is the drying of the Sahel in North Africa. Modeled dynamical changes in
   this region are similar to observed changes that have been associated
   with Sahelian drought. Previous work has identified a near-global,
   quasi-hemispheric pattern of contrasting SST anomalies (cool in the
   Northern Hemisphere and warm in the Southern Hemisphere) associated with
   dry conditions in the Sahel. The present results, combined with this
   earlier finding, suggest that the indirect effects of anthropogenic
   sulfate may have contributed to the Sahelian drying trend. More
   generally, it is concluded that spatially varying aerosol-related
   forcing (both direct and indirect) can substantially alter low-latitude
   circulation and rainfall.},

Abstract = {Daily precipitation in the UK has changed over the period 1961-2000,
   becoming on average more intense in winter and less intense in summer.
   Recent increases in total winter precipitation are shown to be mainly
   due to an increase in the amount of precipitation on wet days, with a
   smaller contribution in the western UK from a trend towards more wet
   days. If the wet-day amounts are modelled using a gamma distribution,
   then positive trends in its scale parameter are found across almost all
   of the UK, consistent with an increased frequency of heavy winter
   precipitation. Non-parametric analyses confirm an increase in the
   contribution of heavy events to winter precipitation totals. Analysis of
   multi-day sequences of heavy rainfall indicate a corresponding increase
   in their frequency. Results for summer show almost opposite trends:
   decreased precipitation totals (driven more equally by fewer wet days
   and reduced wet-day amounts), decreases in gamma scale parameter
   (although accompanied by a trend towards a less positively skewed
   distribution) and decreases in the occurrence of heavy precipitation
   (whether defined parametrically or nonparametrically). A more sparse
   network of weather stations with data back to 1901 suggests that the
   recent winter changes are unusual, while the recent summer changes are
   not, though the poorer coverage reduces the confidence in these
   longer-period results.},

Abstract = {A typical flood frequency analysis is based on gauged annual maximum
   discharges. One assumption behind the analysis is that the measured
   discharge signal is stationary. The validity of this assumption can be
   difficult to establish, particularly where urbanization has occurred
   within the gauged watershed, altering the response of the affected
   watershed to precipitation. This alteration can produce a nonstationary
   streamflow signal that can be significant, depending on the percentage
   of the watershed altered. As urbanization increases, peak discharges are
   shown to increase, producing a positive trend in the annual maximum
   series. Urbanization occurring during and/or after the gauging period is
   quantified using spatially and temporally distributed land use data.
   Three statistical tests (a parametric t-test on the slope of the linear
   relationship between the flood series and time and two nonparametric
   tests: the Kendall's Tau and the Spearman Rank Correlation) are
   performed on both the annual maximum discharge and annual maximum
   discharge-precipitation ratios series to test for trends or
   nonstationary signals corresponding to periods of urbanization. A case
   study suggests that the ratios are more effective than the discharges
   alone for identifying nonstationarity resulting from urbanization. In
   addition, relationships between measures of urbanization and the
   presence or absence of significant trends in the discharge series are
   presented.},

Abstract = {Acid rain and its neutralization by yellow sand in East Asia were
   investigated numerically by an Air Quality Prediction Modeling System
   (AQPMS). AQPMS consists of advection, diffusion, dry and wet deposition,
   gas-phase chemistry and the liquid-phase chemistry. A new deflation
   module of the yellow sand (Asian soil dust) was designed to provide
   explicit information on the dust loading. Different from the previous
   ones for Sahara and Australian deserts, this new one includes three
   major predictors, i.e., the friction velocity, the surface humidity and
   the predominant weather system, while this module was linked to the
   AQPMS. For model validation, the predicted pH values and sulfate- and
   nitrate-ion levels of precipitation, together with the surface
   concentrations of gaseous pollutants, were compared with the measured
   values at atmospheric monitoring stations. and a reasonable agreement
   was obtained. Firstly, the trend of the acid rain in East Asia due to
   the rapid increase of Chinese pollutants emission was investigated, and
   a remarkably rapid increase of acid rain area was predicted in the
   period from 1985 to 1995, the monthly mean pH values showing the
   decrease of 0.3-0.8 in the area from the center to northeast in China,
   and 0.1-0.2 even in Japan and Korea. Secondly, the simulation results of
   April 1995 exhibited a strong neutralization of the precipitation by the
   yellow sand. The monthly mean pH values in the northern China showed a
   remarkable increase of 0.6-1.8 by neutralization effect of the yellow
   sand, while the increases in the southern China were less than 0.1. Even
   in Korea and Japan the yellow sand caused the increase of the pH value
   of rain by 0.1-0.2. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In 1999 the digitisation of old rainfall records of measurements at
   Uccle (Belgium) was completed, which resulted in a unique rainfall
   series of 100 years (period 1898-1997), This is an ideal opportunity to
   search for trends in the rainfall over the last century. Large
   variations in rainfall probability over the century have been observed,
   For small aggregation levels there is a small decrease in extreme
   rainfall events over the century. For large aggregation levels there is
   a more explicit increase in extreme rainfall. Because the rainfall on
   seasonal aggregation level is only slightly increased, the increase in
   extreme rainfall events for aggregation levels between a few days and a
   few months can only occur due to larger clustering. However, the final
   conclusion is that no significant trend can be observed. A pure random
   variation of the rainfall can cause equally large variations. This does
   not exclude a possible trend in flooding frequency, due to the strong
   increase in urbanisation over the last century.},

Abstract = {Large changes in emissions also cause a significant change in pollutant
   concentrations in rain water. The influence of these changes on
   pollutant concentrations in rain water and wet deposition were

   of SO2 (about 5400 kt a(-1)). NOx (about 750 kt a(-1)), and dust (about
   2000 kt a(-1)) at the end of the 1980s. After the reunification of
   Germany in 1990 and restructuring of industry and agriculture, emissions
   drastically decreased, For example, from 1990 to 1998 in Saxony
   emissions of SO2, NOx and dust decreased by 84, 44 and 97\%,
   respectively. Alkaline components also strongly decreased through
   efficient dust removal, while no desulphurization was used in flue gases
   of power and heating plants. As a consequence, the mean acidity of
   precipitation strongly rose by a factor of three from before 1990 Lip to
   1995 (the mean pH value in 1995 was about 3.9, with minimum values down

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal variations in vegetation are examined in relation
   to land tenure, population increase, and rainfall variation in a part of
   Peddle district, Eastern Cape. Sequential aerial photographs between
   1938 and 1988 are analyzed to determine trends in vegetation and
   population change in three different land-tenure units. The areal extent
   at each date of four distinct vegetation categories is determined using
   PC ARC/INFO GIS. Long-term annual rainfall trends far the area are
   analyzed and juxtaposed with vegetation changes. Extensive
   ground-truthing exercises are carried out to verify the present
   condition of vegetation condition in terms of cover and species
   composition. Differences in land-tenure systems are discerned as the
   dominant factor controlling variations in vegetation degradation. The
   study also reveals that neither population changes nor rainfall
   variations can explain the observed trends in vegetation degradation.
   Earlier injudicious land-use practices, sustained since the turn of the
   last century, may provide plausible explanations for the trends and
   present status of vegetation degradation in the area.},

Abstract = {Changes in seasonal patterns of rainfall are key ecological factors. The
   definition of the spatial scale on which these changes can occur is
   particularly relevant in Mediterranean areas, where problems related to
   the variability of the pluviometric regime vary from one place to
   another. The region of Valencia is a good example of this kind of
   variability in rainfall regimes. To study changes in seasonal means and
   variability, we have applied non-parametric (Spearman test) and
   parametric techniques (linear model) to data from 97 pluviometric
   stations during the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) normal
   period, 1961-1990. Special emphasis has been placed on the analysis of
   the spatial pattern of trends in means and variability. For this
   purpose, Ne have used a modified version of the Cramer-von Mises test in
   order to define subregional areas with similar rainfall evolution. Our
   results show a high spatial heterogeneity in rainfall evolution. The
   striking feature is the progressive dryness in the autumn season
   accompanied by an increase in interannual variability. Increases in
   winter and summer interannual variability, and decreases in rainfall
   amounts in winter are dominant too. We discuss these results in relation
   to rainfall generation mechanisms and their ecological implications.

Abstract = {Standardized regional mean annual rainfall series are analysed over the
   period 1951-1989 from a data set of 891 rainfall stations which covers
   23 countries of West and Central Africa. Missing values are estimated by
   using regionalized indexes computed on the basis of a morpho-climatic
   delimitation of 44 homogeneous climatic units. Searches for statistical
   discontinuities in rainfall series show no discontinuity for most units
   of Central Africa. For several units of West Africa the first
   discontinuity occurs at the end of the 1950s. The main discontinuity
   period occurs between 1968 and 1970, followed by a second one at the
   beginning of the 1980s. Rainfall deficit is greater north of 10
   degreesN, and is also important in the Guinean Mountains and on the
   northern coast of the Gulf of Guinea, west of the Atakora Mountains.
   Regions leeward of mountainous areas experienced moderate rainfall
   decrease.},

Abstract = {Regression analysis was used to establish linear trends of rainfall
   amounts and number of events at 140 stations with 40 years of record
   across the Canadian prairies. Annual rainfall was further split into
   three 4-month seasonal groups of amounts and events, and similar
   analysis was performed on these variables. There has been a significant
   increase in the amounts and number of rainfall events during the most
   recent 40-yr period (1956-95). Increase in annual rainfall was 51 mm, or
   about 16\% of the 40-yr mean, while the number of rainfall events
   increased by 17, or about 29\%. Spring (January-April) experienced
   proportionately the largest increase, with amount and number increasing
   by 46\% and 64\%, respectively, during the 40-yr period. This result may
   be related to the conversion of snow to rain as a result of warming
   during this period. The increases in rainfall amount and number of
   events during summer (May-August) were similar to the annual patterns.
   There was no significant increase in amount and number of rainfall
   events during the autumn season (September-December). The increases in
   rainfall amount and number of events were not uniform across the
   prairies, with the least increase in number and amounts of rainfall in
   southern Manitoba, Canada, and the largest increase in Alberta and
   Saskatchewan, Canada. Little or no change in amounts was obtained in the
   northern portion of the prairie provinces. The results confirmed that
   the prairies are not getting drier; however, there are seasonal and
   spatial differences in rainfall trends on the prairie.},

Abstract = {By 1994, an estimated 1.8 million hectares of cleared land in Western
   Australia was affected by secondary dryland salinity to some extent. The
   area affected is likely to double in the coming 20 years. The cause of
   this salinity is excessive recharge under traditional agriculture,
   leading to rising groundwater levels. Monitoring changes in groundwater
   levels is helpful in indicating the degree of threat to agricultural
   land and public assets. Many researchers have studied groundwater level
   rises and attempted to explain them statistically.
   We present an approach for statistically estimating trends in
   groundwater levels. The approach separates the effect of atypical
   rainfall events from the underlying time trend and the lag between
   rainfall and its impact on groundwater is explicitly represented.
   Rainfall is represented as an accumulation of deviations from average
   rainfall. Application of the approach is demonstrated using data from 49
   bores in Jerramungup Shire, Western Australia. The approach provides
   high explanatory power, particularly for deeper bores.},

Abstract = {Since 1995, the work group has been researching the effects of the scale
   of Global Change on the ecosystems in the western Mediterranean (the
   Valencia region of Spain). There were two main areas of interest: first
   the spatial and temporal structure of the rainfall trends as a part of
   the Global Change in the Valencia region, and second the impact that
   rainfall trend has on the ecosystems.
   This work presents the results relating to the spatial and temporal
   structure of the rainfall trends in the Valencia region. We have used a
   daily precipitation data base composed of 97 raingauge stations which
   began recording from 30 to 41 years ago (Perez Cueva, 1994). All series
   cover at least the WMO normal period 1961-1990.
   Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall and the 10 maximum daily
   rainfalls per year have been studied in the context of their trends,
   interannual variability and spatial diversification. Trends have been
   analysed using the Spearman test and their spatial distribution has been
   analysed using a modified version of the Cramer von Mises test.
   The results obtained indicate a decrease in rainfall amount between
   1961-1990 associated to an increment in their variability. Autumn
   rainfall manifests as the main period responsible of these general
   results. At the daily scale, a very short number of days seems to be
   responsible for annual rainfall amounts, and the weight of high
   magnitude events seems to be increased from the 50' or 60' decade.},

Abstract = {Daily rainfall was analysed at 91 high quality stations over eastern and
   southwestern Australia to determine if extreme rainfall had changed
   between 1910 and 1998. Three indices of extreme rainfall were examined:
   the number of events above an extreme threshold (extreme frequency); the
   average intensity of rainfall from extreme events (extreme intensity);
   and the proportion of total rainfall from extreme events (extreme
   percent). Several problems are discussed associated with designing such
   indices under a climate with significant trends in the number of
   raindays. Three different methods are used for calculating the extreme
   intensity and extreme percent indices to account for such trends in
   raindays. A separate analysis was carried out for four separate regions
   with significant results including a decrease in the extreme frequency
   and extreme intensity in southwest Western Australia and an increase in
   the extreme percent in eastern Australia. Trends in the extreme
   intensity and extreme percent are largely dependent on the method used
   to calculate the index. Total rainfall is strongly correlated with the
   extreme frequency and extreme intensity indices, suggesting that extreme
   events are more frequent and intense during years with high rainfall.
   Due to an increase in the number of raindays during such years, the
   proportional contribution from extreme events to the total rainfall
   depends on the method used to calculate this index. Copyright (C) 2000

Abstract = {This paper examines the spatial and temporal rainfall characteristics of
   the region of Valencia, Western Mediterranean Basin least Spain), during
   the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) normal period 1961-1990. The
   study used a dense and homogeneous daily precipitation database
   comprising 97 rain-gauge stations. Total and monthly rainfall
   concentrations have been studied in the context of their mean values,
   interannual variability and spatial diversification. Trends have been
   analysed using both parametric and non-parametric tests. In order to
   establish the spatial distribution of rainfall patterns and to detect
   homogeneous areas with similar rainfall evolution, a statistic based on
   the Cramer-von Mises test is proposed. The kriging interpolation methods
   for characterizing the magnitude of observed changes is used.
   Areas with contrasting rainfall evolution are identified. In more humid
   areas, a significant decrease in annual rainfall associated with
   significant increases in interannual rainfall variability is observed.
   In inland zones, decreases in total annual rainfall and increases in
   interannual variability are less clear, but there are indications of an
   increase in monthly rainfall concentration. In these inland zones, where
   more forest and woodland areas are located and forest fires are
   frequent, the observed trends could greatly affect desertification
   through changes in the disturbance regime. In more arid areas, local
   variability in rainfall evolution is higher and no significant changes
   can be defined. Copyright (C) 2000 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Abstract = {The lowest spatial scale at which current climate models are considered
   to be skillful is on the order of 1000 km because of resolution and
   computer capabilities. The estimation of the regional changes caused by
   anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols therefore is
   problematic. Here a statistical downscaling scheme is used to study the
   relationship between large-scale sea lever pressure and regional
   precipitation in southwestern Europe, both in observed data and in
   outputs from a general circulation model (GCM) forced with increasing
   levers of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. The results indicate
   that the GCM does reproduce the main aspects of the large- to
   local-scale coupled variability. Furthermore, these large- to
   local-scale relationships remain stable in the scenario simulations. The
   GCM runs predict increases of advection of oceanic air masses to the
   Iberian Peninsula that will produce a slight decrease of precipitation
   amounts in the north coast and the opposite effect in the rest of the
   territory, with values that could reach 10 mm decade(-1) in the south.
   In the homogenized historical records, the obtained pattern of change is
   very similar. These results support estimations of future regional
   trends simulated by the GCM under future emission scenarios.},

Abstract = {The effects of rainfall structure and atmospheric circulation
   variability on streamflow in the Alzette River basin (Grand Duchy of
   Luxembourg, Europe) were investigated. Evidence is presented regarding
   the local-scale sensitivity of the Alzette River basin to large-scale
   changes in atmospheric circulation. Since the 1950s, there has been a
   marked increase in the contribution of the westerly component of
   atmospheric circulation to rainfall. These changes in atmospheric
   circulation are on a par with an increase in rainfall intensity and
   duration, which has induced a significant increase in the winter maximum
   daily storm Row in the Alzette River basin since the 1970s.},

Title = {Natural climatic variability and Sahelian rainfall trends},
Journal = {GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {107-131},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Output from a 500-year-long simulation of a global climatic model
   coupled to a mixed-layer oceanic model has been used to investigate
   rainfall variability over the Sahel. As part of the natural climatic
   variability of this run, the model was able to reproduce a period of
   above average rainfall followed by an extensive drought, which has been
   a feature of the Sahel over the last few decades. These rainfall changes
   are shown to be related to characteristic Pacific Ocean sea surface
   temperature (SST) anomalies. The basic features of the simulated SST,
   rainfall and wind changes in the Sahelian region are in agreement with
   observations. Large-scale teleconnection patterns were identified via
   1-point correlation maps, which demonstrated the dominance of the
   Pacific region. Concentrating on the specifics associated with the
   extended period of anomalous Sahelian rainfall, a contemporaneous period
   of exceptional SST anomalies was identified in the Pacific Ocean. A
   marked anti-correlation was identified between the long-term trends in
   these SST anomalies and Sahelian rainfall. The mechanism connecting
   these Pacific SST anomalies to the Sahelian region was identified to be
   the Pacific North America (PNA) oscillation. Quite different PNA
   patterns occurred for the extended periods of above and below average
   Sahelian rainfall. The PNA oscillation was found to influence the
   Sahelian rainfall via its impact on the North Atlantic Oscillation. The
   particularly extended period of Sahelian rainfall anomalies was
   additionally influenced by a synchronised temporal variation of the PNA
   oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation at this time. Thus, this
   particular simulation suggests that the recent anomalous Sahelian
   rainfall can be attributed to natural climatic variability originating
   with SST anomalies in the Pacific Ocean. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {Gold-bearing breccias of the Rain mine, Carlin trend, Nevada},

Year = {2000},

Abstract = {The Rain mine includes two mined-out open pits that contained 36.4 t
   (1.17 Moz) gold, averaging 1.8 g/t gold, and underground reserves,
   including underground production, estimated at 4.9 t (157,000 oz) gold
   averaging 7.7 g/t. Rain orebodies are localized in a breccia complex
   within the hanging wall of the Rain fault and hosted within the
   Mississippian Webb Formation immediately overlying the contact with the
   Devonian Devils Gate Limestone.
   The ore host includes four texturally and genetically distinct breccia
   types: (1) crackle breccia; (2) hydrothermal breccia; (3) tuffisite with
   accretionary lapilli; and (4) collapse breccia. Crackle breccia forms a
   capping over multistage hydrothermal breccias that are cut by tabular-
   to pipe-shaped tuffisite dikes, with some containing accretionary
   lapilli. Pre- and synore hydrothermal breccias formed during at least
   three episodes of convective fluidization, followed by quartz
   sulfide-barite cementation. High-grade gold was deposited as a late
   phase along the upper portion of the hydrothermal breccia mass and
   extended into the crackle breccia zone. Collapse breccias occur along
   the floor of the composite breccia mass and have irregular upper and
   lower contacts. The lower contact occurs on a dissolution boundary with
   the Devils Gate Limestone.
   Matrix-supported, heterolithic, hydrothermal breccias at Rain consist of
   sedimentary rock fragments composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone,
   limestone, and conglomerate. Some fragments contain as much as 8 percent
   introduced biotite in veinlets and/or fragment matrix replacements. The
   veinlets consist of euhedral quartz, biotite, sphalerite, and pyrite.
   Barite constitutes as much as 60 percent of the hydrothermal breccias in
   the form of fragments and as a cement to the breccias. Quartz
   replacement of fragments and as a breccia cement is pervasive. The total
   sulfide content in unoxidized ores is less than 5 volume percent.
   The Rain orebody resulted from five interpreted stages of development:
   (1) structural preparation along the right-lateral oblique Rain fault
   system and conjugate left-lateral oblique northeast-striking faults; (2)
   multiple episodes of hydrothermal breccia formation, with high-grade
   gold deposition immediately following the last brecciation event; (3)
   late channelized and fluidized rock fragments and fine clays forming
   tuffisite bodies with accretionary lapilli; (4) postmineral extensional
   reactivation of structures; and (5) collapse brecciation resulting from
   postore supergene acidic fluid pending on and dissolving the upper
   Devils Gate Limestone. The age of the Rain orebody is poorly
   constrained. Et is older than 22 Ma supergene alunite, but no maximum
   age constraints other than the Mississippian host rock are known.},

Abstract = {The sea surface temperature (SST) data for low latitudes in the Pacific,
   Atlantic, and Indian Oceans for 1950-1996 (47 years) showed different
   seasonal variation patterns at different longitudes. When the seasonal
   patterns were subtracted from the monthly values, the deseasoned
   residuals showed considerable anomalies (interannual variability). In
   the Pacific the main features were the Fl Nino events. In the Atlantic,
   North and South Atlantic SST showed dissimilar anomalies, and these did
   not have any fixed lag or lead relationships with the Pacific events.
   The same was true for the low-latitude Indian Ocean SST. The correlation
   of Pacific SST with Atlantic or Indian Oceans' SST was less than similar
   to 0.65, yielding a common variance (square of the correlation) of less
   than similar to 40\%. Thus, whereas SST anomalies might have some common
   origin, the manifestation of SST anomalies at different longitudes was
   erratic, with no preference for any longitude to start with, nor any
   definite sequence of occurrence in the Pacific relative to the Atlantic
   or Indian Oceans. A spectral analysis showed that all regions had
   quasi-biennial, quasi-triennial, and higher periodicities, but the exact
   values of these periodicities differed significantly at different
   longitudes. All parameters had long-term trends. These were mostly
   nonuniform, almost negligible in the first half (1950-1973) and mostly
   upward in the second half (1973-1996), indicating warming in recent
   decades, which is also reflected in decreases in snow cover area in the
   Northern Hemisphere. Rainfalls in various regions are considerably
   influenced by local SST regimes. For northeast Brazil, Atlantic SST
   influence is overpowering and often operates independently of the
   Pacific SST (El Ninos). Hence the emphasis given in mass media (press,
   radio, and television) to the role of Fl Nino events only in influencing
   the rainfalls may turn out to be misleading, as seems to have happened
   for the 1997 Fl Nino. This El Niiio started in early 1997 but did not
   have any significant influence on rainfall in northeast Brazil and
   India. It continued strongly in 1998, causing a severe drought in
   northeast Brazil but no drought in India.},

Abstract = {Trends and periodicities of annual rainfall for 29 sub-divisions of
   India and all India (area-weighted average of the sub-divisions) are
   studied by using the rainfall series for a period of 124 years
   (1871-1994). The trends are evaluated by using a linear regression
   technique. To identify the climatic changes, the rainfall series are
   subjected to 11-year moving averages. These averages show some epochs.
   From this, it is found that in some sub-divisions the trend in one
   direction reverses its direction after some years. The years pertaining
   to these changes are identified and the trends are calculated for the
   segments of the series. The significance of the trend values are tested.
   Power spectra are obtained using the maximum-entropy method The periods
   zn the range 2.0-2.5 years are present in the rainfall series of the
   sub-divisions to the north of 20 degrees N, on the west coast, and in
   Tamilnadu and for all India. This periodicity may be attributed to the
   quasi-biennial oscillation. Rainfall series of the most of the
   subdivisions and all India indicate a triennial cycle. Significant
   periods in the range from 3.0 to 8.0 years and 8.0 to 12.0 years are
   also identified.},

Abstract = {An amplifying fluctuation is detected in the time series of annual
   rainfall, starting about mid-1930s in the province of Cordoba (central
   Argentina). The timescale of this fluctuation initially had a value
   approximate to 10 years, and increased to a value of about 20 years.
   This fluctuation is structured as a train of centers of negative and
   positive rainfall perturbation alternating in time. A strong positive
   trend in annual rainfall amount started simultaneously to excitation of
   amplifying fluctuation. Analyses of contribution fi om bands of wavelet
   timescale to reconstruction of time series of perturbation of annual
   rainfall amount indicate that trend is produced by fluctuations with
   timescale larger than 10 years. Before 1935, annual rainfall had a
   stationary mean. After that year, mean annual rainfall in this region is
   increasing at a rate of 5 mm/year. During the period 1935-1983, the
   trend produced by contribution from fluctuations with timescale greater
   than 10 years is 4.6 mm/year. The remaining 0.4 mm/year of trend is
   produced by fluctuations with timescale smaller than 10 years, and it
   does not have statistical significance. The amplifying fluctuation in
   the bands of fluctuations with timescale 10-17 years and 17-27 years, is
   clearly detected in the 3-month periods November to January, and
   February to April. These are also the only two 3-month periods with
   trend statistically significant. Regression analysis of seasonal
   rainfall on year indicates that there is a discontinuity in trend
   between the periods 1873-1934 and 1935-1983. In periods November to
   January and February to April, fluctuations with timescale larger than
   10 years produce a statistically significant trend after 1935.
   Fluctuations with timescale smaller than 10 years do not contribute in a
   significant way to trend in these seasons. During the 60 years before
   wave excitation (period 1873-1934), wavelet analysis does not show
   another amplifying fluctuation of such strong intensity. Finding what
   triggered this gargantuan amplifying fluctuation in annual rainfall is
   an important question for understanding multidecadal climate
   variability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Acidity in rain has several natural origins, such as biomass burning,
   and agricultural and maritime sources. Emissions from power-station
   stacks and industry are of concern. The economic cost of fitting control
   technologies to limit the emissions of acid precursors such as sulphur
   dioxide and oxides of nitrogen to the atmosphere is potentially very
   large. It is thus essential that the need for controls be adequately
   demonstrated before industry commits itself to this action. Such
   demonstration requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms
   involved in acidification and the time it will take for ecosystem
   responses to develop. This needs to be seen within the context of
   continuing progress towards fundamentally cleaner technologies and the
   fact the South Africa is a relative latecomer as an industrialized
   country. Rain quality has been monitored by Eskom (the national
   electricity supplier) since the mid-1980s, end this paper analyses
   trends over time for seven sites with data for seven or more years.
   Trends in volume-weighted concentrations are evident for several
   parameters, with chloride, potassium, hydrogen and sodium increasing
   over time, and acetate, magnesium and formats decreasing at almost all
   sites. Total anions are increasing at three sites, and decreasing at
   one, while total cations are increasing at six sites. The ratio of total
   anions to total cations is decreasing significantly at all but one site.
   The major trend is related to biomass burning, and appears to have been
   affected by drought over this period. Fossil fuel-derived acidity is
   increasing only at Warden.},

   signatures were found for all sites, these being related to industrial,
   maritime, biomass, and soil components. Trends in these indices were
   evident, mainly when the biomass component was concerned. This may be a
   result of drought when there was little veld to be burned. There was

Abstract = {Trends in heavy rainfall, total rainfall and number of dry days in
   Australia have been analysed using daily rainfall records at 125
   stations. Summer and winter halves of the year were considered
   separately for the period 1910-1990. The summer half-year is defined as
   November-April, while the winter-half is May-October. Heavy rainfall is
   defined as the 90th and 95th percentiles of daily rainfall in each
   half-year. The magnitude of trends was derived from linear regression
   while statistical significance was determined by Kendall-Tau and field
   significance tests.
   Increasing trends in heavy rainfall and total rainfall have occurred
   during the summer half-year, but only 10-20\% of stations have
   statistically significant trends. During the winter half-year, heavy
   rainfall and total rainfall have also increased, except in far southwest
   Western Australia and inland Queensland. There has been a reduction in
   the number of dry days in both halves of the year, except in far
   southwest Western Australia and at a few stations in eastern Australia
   where there has been an increase in the number of dry days in the winter
   half-year. Changes in the number of dry days were statistically
   significant at over 50\% of stations.
   Hence there are regions showing coherent increases and decreases in
   rainfall which may be due to systematic changes in climate during the
   last century. Trends were averaged over three broad regions with
   adequate station coverage. There has been a general decrease in dry days
   with an increase in total and heavy rainfall intensity in the northeast
   and southeast, and a decrease in total and heavy rainfall in the
   southwest. These rainfall changes are related to changes in other
   climate variables such as temperature and cloud cover in Australia. (C)

Abstract = {Long hydrological records, from the Amazon Basin, northeastern Brazil,
   and northwestern Peru spanning most of this century, are examined for
   trends in rainfall (three wettest months) and runoff (three months of
   highest flow) or stage, where no rating curves exist. Trends are tested
   for significance using the Mann-Kendall statistic. In basins where large
   soil, aquifer, or man-made reservoirs give rise to appreciable over-year
   storage, flows and water levels may be serially correlated. Where serial
   correlation exists, the usual statistical tests (linear regression,
   t-test, and Mann-Kendall) will overestimate the significance of trends,
   showing significance where none exists. Analysis for trend therefore
   requires particular care when data are serially correlated, and to avoid
   misleading results, additional supportive evidence must be sought. For
   example, rainfall records within the same river basin can be checked for
   trends; serial correlation in rainfall records, in particular, is less
   likely to be present, so the validity of any trends in rainfall is less
   open to question. Strong negative trends were found in flow data from
   the coast of northern Peru and the Sao Francisco River, while positive
   significant trends were detected in the Parnaiba River basin. No
   significant trends were found in the discharge or stage records from
   Amazonia, while rainfall in northeastern Brazil shows a slow increase
   over long periods. In the Parnaiba and in some rivers of northern Peru
   unusually large discharges at the beginning or end of the records seem
   to account for the direction and significance of trends.},

Abstract = {Sound basin management at urban or greater scale needs reliable design
   storm definition. A statistical analysis is carried out on extreme
   annual. rainfall series for durations of 1, 3, 6 and 12 hours occurring
   at two gauges in Tuscany, Italy. Kendall's test is applied to the
   extremal series to detect a definite increasing (or decreasing) trend. A
   special form of an ARIMA model is also fitted to the series to quantify
   possible linear trends and their respective significance. Results show a
   clearly increasing trend at shortest duration at both gauges, no trend
   at longer ones. Time evolution of design storms for all durations and
   return periods up to 25 years is derived and analysed based on Gumbel
   distribution. Applications are presented concerning impacts of
   uncertainties for the design of urban drainage networks. (C) 1998

Abstract = {Dendrochronological methods were used to investigate the climate-growth
   relationships of trees in the North Patagonian rain forest of southern
   Chile with the aim of producing long temperature-sensitive tree-ring
   records. Two Nothofagus betuloides (Mirbel) Oersted and two
   Pilgerodendron uviferum (D. Don.) Florin chronologies were developed
   from sites at the upper treeline in coastal areas of the Aisen Region
   (45-46 degrees S). One Pilgerodendron chronology was also developed at a
   nearby site in low-elevation forest. Comparison of radial growth records
   with climate data from Puerto Aisen indicates that at the treeline,
   Pilgerodendron demonstrates a significant positive response to both
   annualized and late-summer temperatures. Treeline Nothofagus respond
   strongly to early to midsummer temperatures. Radial growth records from
   the treeline sites, particularly those from Pilgerodendron, contain
   long-term variations comparable with those of other
   temperature-sensitive chronologies from southern South America; most
   apparent is an increase in ring widths since the middle of the twentieth
   century. While they do not contain a strong temperature signal, the
   low-elevation Pilgeradendron trees appear to retain a strong regional
   moisture signal. The results of this study suggest that, with careful
   site selection, long proxy temperature records are obtainable from the
   wet coastal forests of southwestern South America.},

Title = {Trend, decadal and interannual variability in annual rainfall of

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Annual rainfall anomalies over subequatorial and northern tropical
   Africa are analysed for interannual and interdecadal variability over
   the time interval 1900-1994. Then, the main modes of variation in the
   annual rainfall field are related to the same frequencies of variation
   in several SST indexes chosen in key-areas. First, empirical orthogonal
   function (EOF) analysis is performed on the annual rainfall anomalies
   held for extracting the main dominant spatio-temporal modes, and leading
   principal components are analysed through multi-singular spectrum
   analysis (M-SSA). Regional rainfall anomaly indices, constructed from
   EOF analysis and describing, respectively, the temporal variability of
   Sahel, Guinea Gulf area, equatorial East Africa and Gabon-Congo area,
   are analysed individually through Monte Carlo SSA for assessing the
   level of significance of spectral peaks. Low-frequency variability,
   strongest north of 5 degrees N, is a combination of a non-linear trend
   mixed with an irregular oscillation near 25-40 years. Together, these
   modes contribute about 35-40 per cent of the Sahelian regional variance
   and about 15-20 per cent of the Guinean one. The low-frequency
   Variability shows weak negative values till 1915-1920, then positive
   ones till 1967-1970, with a relative minimum near 1940-1945, and lastly,
   strong negative values. This behaviour must be placed in a larger
   context of at least Atlantic-basin scale, or at a global scale in which
   the strongest signal seems to be the reversing of the interhemispheric
   thermal gradient around 1970. A quasi-decadal pulse (near 12-13 years)
   is also observed over Sahel and explains about 12-14 per cent of the
   regional rainfall index variance. Even if associated SSA components are
   not significant when a red noise null-hypothesis is considered, some
   physical consistency is found between this mode and a similar
   oscillation concerning the thermal gradient between tropical northern
   and equatorial Atlantic. At the interannual scale, significant
   oscillations of 5.1-5.8 years (quasi-quinquennial oscillation-QQO)
   (contributing less than 5 per cent of the Sahelian variance to almost 20
   per cent of the East African one), and of 3.2-3.6 years (quasi-triennial
   oscillation-QTO) (explaining from 5 to 10 per cent of the Sahelian
   Variance to 20-25 per cent of the East African one) are the first ones
   before quasi-biennial oscillations (2.0-2.8 years) which explain in
   general less than 5 per cent of the variance and at maximum, near 10 per
   cent of the Variance in Equatorial Africa. The QQO and QTO seem to be
   modulated frequencies of the same phenomenon connected to central and
   eastern tropical Pacific (CETP): (i) QQO, which is characterized by an
   out-of-phase pattern between East Africa (more/less rainfall than normal
   when CETP and western Indian Ocean is anomalously warm/cold) and central
   Africa seems to be associated mainly with in-phase behaviour between the
   CETP and western Indian Ocean. The relation is stable during the
   twentieth century; (ii) QTO, which is characterized by an in-phase
   pattern from East Africa to the Sahel (less/more rainfall when CETP is
   anomalously warm/cold) seems to be related only to CETP and this
   relation is strongest at the end of the period (after 1960-1970).
   Relationships between QQO and QTO of rainfall with the same oscillations
   of the Atlantic SST index are weak. (C) 1997 by the Royal Meteorological
   Society.},

Abstract = {1. In 13 of 14 contrasts between light-demanding and shade-tolerant
   genera within the same subfamily or family, the shade-tolerators have
   seeds of greater mean dry mass, but in eight out of nine contrasts
   between light-demanding and shade;tolerant species within genera the
   shade-tolerators have seeds of about the same or slightly lesser mass.
   2. We use the results To emphasize the low position of seed size in the
   hierarchy of characteristics enabling plants to became established in
   the shade.
   3. Within genera and among confamilial genera of shade-tolerant plants
   there can be differences of one to three orders of magnitude in seed dry
   mass. By hypothesis, species whose seedlings have a given degree of
   tolerance of shade, as Such, may make many `risky' seeds or few `safe'
   seeds, the larger-seeded species being buffered against drought and the
   effects of herbivores or falling branches. Extremes of seed size
   represent particular adaptations; very small-seeded species (<1 mg)
   establish on steep micro-slopes free of litter, while very large seeds
   (>2000 mg) attract especially large animals as dispersers, Seed size is
   seen as adaptive in contexts other than survival of shade as such.},

Abstract = {We investigated successional trends on windthrow mounds in two
   old-growth Tsuga heterophylla - Picea sitchensis forests in northern
   southeast Alaska to determine the influence of windthrow disturbance on
   the maintenance of plant;diversity. We were particularly interested in
   assessing the value of mosses in detecting long-term effects of
   disturbance in temperate rainforests. Mosses established a dense carpet
   on windthrow mounds within the first few decades after the disturbance.
   No consistent changes were noted in total moss and vascular plant cover,
   moss biomass, or species diversity between young mounds (+/- 50 yrs),
   intermediate mounds (+/- 150 yrs) or old mounds (> 200 yrs), or between
   mounds and the undisturbed forest floor, despite consistent differences
   in soils development.
   Classification and ordination of the vegetation data did not show a
   consistent relationship between soil surface age or soil depth and
   overall species composition on the two sites. Young mounds were the most
   compositionally distinctive, primarily due to moss species. Pogonatum
   alpinum var. sylvaticum, P. contortum and Polytrichum formosum were
   generally confined to young mounds with unstable substrata, while
   Dicranum majus and Sphagnum girgensohnii were associated with old soil
   surfaces and deep organic soils. Vascular plant species with affinities
   for riparian or deep shade habitats (Tiarella trifoliata, Coptis
   asplenifolia and Dryopteris expansa) showed a general preference for the
   forest floor. Gymnocarpium dryopteris was the only vascular plant with a
   significant association with young mounds.
   Mosses comprised approximately 25\% of understory plant biomass and as
   much as 50\% of understory productivity. In cool temperate forests, the
   inclusion of mosses in vegetation analysis may provide valuable insights
   into the nature of vegetation patterns over subtle environmental
   gradients. The distinctiveness of the temperate rainforest type and the
   unique ecological effects of windthrow disturbance in this type;are also
   suggested by this study.},

Abstract = {Daily rainfall data for 53 stations in the Australian tropics have been
   used to investigate interannual changes in the intensity of the 90th and

   average of the 90th and 95th percentiles, The analysis considers
   rainfall in the months between September and April from 1910 to 1989.
   Increasing trends in the 90th and 95th percentile rainfall intensity and
   frequency occur at most stations, but few are statistically significant,
   Some stations with negative trends are located south of the Gulf of
   Carpentaria, Strong positive correlations exist between total summer
   half-year rainfall and both the intensity and frequency of heavy
   rainfall
   Relationships between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and these
   heavy rainfall parameters were stronger during the period from 1950-1989
   relative to 1910-1949, suggesting a change in large-scale atmospheric
   circulation patterns, In eastern tropical Australia, the winter SOI is
   well correlated with heavy rainfall parameters in the summer half-year,
   so there is potential to foreshadow heavy rainfall events two seasons in
   advance.},

Abstract = {This paper reports the results of statistical analyses for the detection
   of time trend in 48 rainfall records from sites in the Amazon Basin with
   more than 15 yr of record. Using a nonparametric test for trend in
   monthly rainfall, three results emerge: (a) irrespective of the
   statistical significance of time trends, positive and negative trends
   occur with approximately equal frequencies over the Brazilian Amazon
   hydrographic basin; (b) the number of statistically significant time
   trends, whether positive or negative, is very much greater than can be
   ascribed to chance variation; (c) significantly negative time trends are
   more common than significantly positive time trends in monthly rainfall.
   Over the period of approximately 30 yr covered by the records, during
   which deforestation has been rapid, negative trends seem to have
   occurred more frequently in two regions of western and central Amazonia,
   and positive trends more frequently in eastern Amazonia. There is some
   qualitative agreement between the disposition of contours defining
   regions of negative trend (reduced rainfall) in the rainfall records,
   and the contours defining regions of reduced rainfall following 50\%
   deforestation, as predicted by the U.K. Hadley Centre for Climate
   Prediction and Research. However, the rainfall records show positive
   trends (increased rainfall, confirming the conclusion of Chu et al.) in
   some parts of the region where the Hadley Centre predicts reduced
   rainfall, following deforestation of 50\% or more.},

   reduction occurred in August or September.  Although there was a delay
   in the onset of the rains at the two westernmost stations, the main
   reason for the decrease in rainfall was a reduction of 6-25 days in the
   number of rain-days during the rainy season.  This increased the mean
   duration of dry spells during the rainy season by up to 1.5 days.  No
   change in the average rainfall per rain-day was detected except at Maine

Abstract = {The relationship between rainfall, lion predation and population trends
   in African herbivores, with special emphasis on buffalo, wildebeest and
   zebra, was studied in the central district of the Kruger National Park
   between 1968 and 1992. The study commenced at the end of a dry cycle,
   and moved into a 10-year wet cycle that was followed by another 10-year
   dry cycle. Populations of the herbivores reacted differently to these
   cycles: those of wildebeest and zebra fluctuated inversely with
   rainfall, whereas those of buffalo and the other herbivores fluctuated
   directly with rainfall to a greater or lesser degree. The proportions in
   which some species were represented in lion kill samples followed a
   similar trend, with wildebeest and zebra being more vulnerable in the
   wet cycle and buffalo and waterbuck being more vulnerable in the dry
   cycle. Simulations of the buffalo, wildebeest and zebra populations
   suggest that buffalo are more heavily influenced by predation during
   population declines than are the other two species, followed by
   wildebeest, with zebra experiencing the smallest influence. The driving
   force in the ecosystem, however, appeared to be rainfall.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the internal spatial distribution of rain rates
   inside the rain areas. Moving trend functions are defined for different
   thresholds tau. They are obtained as conditional mathematical
   expectations of the rain rates above tau, and depend on the distance
   between the considered point with rain rate higher than tau and the
   boundary of the tau-thresholded area, which is the area where the
   intensity is above tau. These functions are linked to the dynamics of
   rainfall patterns and are thus named moving trend functions. Such
   functions are calculated on a dataset of hourly rainfall fields recorded
   in 1989 and 1990 in the framework of the Epsat-Niger project. The study
   area is about 12 000 km(2) and is instrumented with a dense gauge
   network. The shape of the moving trend functions show that, on average,
   the rain intensity increases from the edge to the center of the
   tau-thresholded areas. Thus, the spatial distribution of the rain rates
   depends on the shape of the tau-thresholded areas.
   An estimation algorithm for mean areal rainfall is then proposed using
   the moving trend functions. This estimation implicitly depends on the
   shape of the tau-thresholded area. The algorithm is applied to two
   subareas of 400 and 3600 km(2) of the Niger dataset. The method is also
   compared with the threshold method on these two subareas. The two
   techniques give equivalent results on the 3600-km(2) area and some small
   improvements can be observed on the 400-km(2) area, especially for low
   thresholds. However, problems encountered in the estimation of the
   moving trend functions discussed in the paper and due to the finite size
   of the study area prevent the moving trend function technique to
   demonstrate its potentiality clearly.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of long-term trends and fluctuations
   in rainfall characteristics on runoff from the Little Washita River
   watershed. For this 610 km(2) watershed, mean daily discharge, peak
   flow, flow frequency, and volume increased significantly over a 22-year
   period, despite the installation of flood water retarding structures
   which controlled 45\% of the drainage area. Changes in runoff are shown
   to be associated with long-term increases in rainfall amount, intensity,
   and frequency. Time series analyses of rainfall and watershed runoff
   demonstrated that changes in rainfall patterns and amounts can mask the
   beneficial impacts of floodwater retarding structures. Concurrent
   meteorologic conditions must be measured and evaluated for proper
   interpretation of downstream impacts of upstream conservation measures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {72},

Abstract = {An observational study has been made of the recent decreasing trend of
   the Sahelian rainfall from the 1950's to the 1980's and its relation to
   the tropical African rainbelt, tropical atmospheric circulation, and sea
   surface temperature (SST) pattern. This investigation incorporates the
   trend and correlation analyses of the rainfall, rainbelt, upper-air, and
   SST data, along with a rotated empirical orthogonal function (R-EOF)
   analysis of SSTs.
   An analysis for the northern summer season shows that the reduction in
   total rainfall of the rainbelt is more responsible for the decreasing
   trend in the Sahelian rainfall than the equatorward retraction of the
   rainbelt. The decreasing trend in the rainbelt's total rainfall is
   related to increasing trends in 700hPa heights and 850-500hPa
   thicknesses throughout tropical Africa. The vertical profile of
   temperature for Niamey suggests that these trends in the lower
   troposphere may result from intensified large-scale subsidence.
   The trends of the tropical African upper-air are accompanied by a
   tropical east-west contrasting pattern for the 700hPa heights having
   increasing trends between the Atlantic-Africa regions and between the
   Indonesia-central Pacific regions, and decreasing trends over the Indian
   Ocean.
   The R-EOF analysis of SSTs indicates that the occurrence of the above
   east-west trend pattern is probably associated with the dominant warming
   trends of the Indian Ocean, while the SST anomaly pattern contrasting
   the tropical North and South Atlantic documented in previous studies
   plays a major role in the year-to-year latitudinal displacement of the
   rainbelt.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the annual extreme rainfall series in the time scale of 1
   to 3 days duration at 316 stations, well distributed over the Indian
   region, covering 80-years of rainfall data from 1901 to 1980 were
   analysed for trend and persistence using standard statistical tests. It
   has been found that the annual extreme rainfall records of most stations
   are free from trend and persistence. However, the extreme rainfall
   series at stations over the west coast north of 12-degrees-N and at some
   stations to the east of the Western Ghats over the central parts of the
   Peninsula showed a significant increasing trend at 95\% level of
   confidence. Stations over the southern Peninsula and over the lower
   Ganga valley have been found to exhibit a decreasing trend at the same
   level of significance. The data series of the stations which showed
   trends were subjected to a 10-year moving average and the resulting
   smoothed series have been discussed. It may be said that this increasing
   or decreasing trend in the annual extreme rainfall events at a few
   places will have tremendous implications in the hydrologic studies and
   dam design projects.},

Abstract = {Using oral histories, archival materials, and observations of present
   behavior, a largely hypothetical historical reconstruction of the
   natural resource exploitation and subsistence practices of Lese farmers
   and Efe foragers in the Ituri Forest of northeastern Zaire is presented.
   Distinct epochs associated with the advent of forest agriculture,
   Belgian colonization, and post-independence economic collapse have
   resulted in changes in local population density, the range of forest
   resources exploited, and the spatial distribution and intensity of
   resource use. Broadly speaking, there has been a historical trend toward
   sedentism, spatial clumping of settlements, localization of resource
   exploitation, reduced importance of forest carbohydrates in the diet,
   and an increased reliance on agricultural products. Over time the Efe
   and Lese exchange system has changed, in relation to the items traded
   and the relative dependence of each partner on the exchange
   relationship. Involvement in this alliance has had a considerable impact
   on Efe settlement pattern, diet, and probably fecundity. It ultimately
   placed the Lese in a position of power over the Efe, and provided the
   farmers with means to enter a transient monetary economy. By providing a
   retrospective on Efe and Lese subsistence, we hope to demonstrate that
   to decipher the relative benefits and constraints of this contemporary
   exchange relationship, we must understand their historical etiology.},

   Whilst concentrations of inorganic lead have fallen broadly in line with

   fallen by only 50\% or less, and thus the ratio of alkyl-lead to

Abstract = {The number, average length, and average intensity of rain events at five
   stations located in eastern Australia have been calculated for each year
   from 19 1 0 to 1988, using daily rainfall totals. A rain event has been
   defined as a period of consecutive days on which rainfall has been
   recorded on each day. Inter-relationships between the rain-event
   variables (at each station and between stations), along with their
   relationships with annual rainfall and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation,
   have been investigated. Trends in the time series of the rain-event
   variables have also been examined. Annual rainfall variations are found
   to be primarily caused by variations in intensity. Fluctuations in the
   three rain-event variables are essentially independent of each other.
   This is due, in some cases, to inter-relationships at interdecadal time
   scales offsetting relationships of the opposite sense at shorter time
   scales. The large-scale geographical nature of east Australian rainfall
   fluctuations mainly reflects interstation correlations in the number of
   events. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation affects rainfall mainly by
   influencing the number and intensity of rain events. Twentieth century
   increases in east Australian rainfall have been due, primarily, to
   increased numbers of events. Intensity of rain events has generally
   declined, offsetting some of the increase in rainfall expected from more
   frequent events.},

Abstract = {Changes in the distribution of vegetation and rainfall over the

   photosynthetically active biomass was determined from visible satellite
   imagery using internationally accepted algorithms. Trends in rainfall
   were evaluated on the coastal plain to the south of 33-degrees-S and
   over the elevated interior to the north of 33-degrees-S. During the
   study period, rainfall exhibited a declining trend over the coastal
   plains. In contrast, the elevated interior experienced a three-fold
   increase. In response, photosynthetic activity within the coastal belt
   declined, whereas the interior Karoo region was replenished with
   vegetation including savanna-type shrubs and grasses. Changes in the
   distribution of rainfall and vegetation may be explained by a southward
   shift of the sub-tropical and mid-latitude climate zones. Such a shift
   could become a permanent feature in a global-warming scenario, and
   focusses attention on the plight of marginal agricultural zones in the
   face of increasing drought and human stress.},

Abstract = {Trends in the large-scale tropical circulation during 1948-1883 are
   studied in relation to the persistent drought in Subsaharan Africa,
   based on ship observations over the tropical oceans and surface records
   of stations in Western Africa, and using cluster, correlation, and trend
   analyses.
   Deficient Sahel rainy seasons are characterized in the Atlantic sector
   by an equatorward expansion of the North Atlantic subtropical high,
   enhanced Northeast trades and reduced southerly cross-equatorial flow,
   and anomalously cold surface waters across the tropical North Atlantic,
   and in the Indian Ocean by relatively high sea surface temperature.
   These associations with Sahel rainfall variations are typical both of
   year-to-year and trend-like changes.
   Trends of the large-scale circulation setting in the Atlantic sector
   include a pressure rise over the tropical North Atlantic; southward
   migration of the near-equatorial trough; acceleration of both the North
   and South Atlantic trades along with increasing cloudiness in the
   equatorial zone; increasing cloudiness over the tropical North Atlantic
   and the Central American Seas; and cooling of surface waters in a band
   across the tropical North Atlantic contrasting with warming in the South
   Atlantic.
   Records at land stations in Western Africa show near-coastal temperature
   and pressure trends consistent with the adjacent ocean areas. In the
   interior of Subsaharan Africa warming trends prevail, presumably as
   direct consequence of reduced inflow of cool maritime monsoon air,
   precipitation, and in-situ evaporation. Downward pressure trends at
   continental stations in Subsaharan Africa may reflect the hydrostatic
   effect of increasing temperature.},

   storm, the O-18 content expressed as deltaO-18 varied greatly (+2.79 to
   -24.65 parts per thousand), but showed greatest variability for the
   smaller rainstorms with low intensities. Also, O-18 depletion was
   greatest for storms of Atlantic (-10.9 parts-per thousand) vs. Gulf
   (-6.2 parts per thousand) origin. Within a storm, the O-18 content
   varied greatly, but usually was depleted as the storm continued. For one
   storm, the deltaO-18 decreased from -4.00 to -20.00 parts per thousand
   over a 10 h span of continuous rainfall. The most rapid changes in
   deltaO-18 (2-6 parts per thousand h-1) within a storm occurred mostly
   during storm intervals characterized by rapidly increasing rainfall
   intensities associated with moderate to high rainfall rates (more than 5
   mm h-1). When these bursts occurred within longer storms, the most rapid
   changes in O-18 content were associated with the higher rainfall
   intensities.},

Abstract = {The spatial and temporal variations of the monsoon rainfall over India
   have been studied using the subdivisional rainfall data for the years
   1871-1988. North-west India and north peninsular India are found to
   constitute two homogeneous regions. North-east India does not constitute
   a single homogeneous region since the rainfall variations in Bihar and
   Bengal are somewhat different from those in Assam and the Sub-Himalayan
   region.
   Trends in the monsoon rainfall in different subdivisions and in the
   whole of India also have been examined. In the monsoon rainfall,
   decreasing trends during late nineteenth century and again in the 1960s
   are observed. The latter trend was reversed in the early 1970s. These
   trends are seen prominently in central and western Indian subdivisions,
   however, there are major differences in the epochs of changes in the
   trends in different subdivisions. The decreasing trend observed in the
   1960s is still continuing in the central north Indian divisions, while
   in the adjoining divisions, the reversal took place in the early 1970s.},

Abstract = {Long-term changes in the Indian monsoon rainfall on regional and local
   scales have important social and economic consequences. To present a
   comprehensive picture of such changes, the monthly rainfall data at 306
   stations, well spread over India, have been analysed over 114 years
   (1871 1984), for long-term trends. The trends are quantified by linear
   trend for monthly as well as seasonal rainfall for each station. Some
   broad contiguous areas showing statistically significant trends have
   been identified. Areas of increasing trend in the monsoon seasonal
   rainfall are found along the west coast, north Andhra Pradesh and
   north-west India, and those of decreasing trend over east Madhya Pradesh
   and adjoining areas, north-east India and parts of Gujarat and Kerala.
   The subseasonal patterns indicate that the excess or deficiency of the
   monsoon rainfall is more frequently realized in the later half of the
   season. Monsoon rainfall tends to be more concentrated in August, over
   the west coast and central India.},

Abstract = {A set of high-quality rainfall records is used to examine rainfall
   trends over Australia during the twentieth century.  The 191 stations
   used have been selected by an exhaustive search of documentation
   regarding instrumentation, observational practices, site relocations,
   and exposure.  Statistical tests of the reliability of observing
   practices also have been applied in the selection process, as well as
   tests to detect inhomogeneities.  The data set used is the most reliable
   available for monitoring rainfall trends during the twentieth century. 
   The data have been clustered objectively into groups exhibiting similar
   variations in annual rainfall.  A subset of 10 stations (one for each
   cluster) suitable for long-term monitoring of rainfall trends is
   selected.  The trends in annual, winter, and summer rainfall are
   exhibited.  The study confirms trends noted in earlier studies.  Summer
   rainfall over much of eastern Australia increased abruptly around 1950. 
   In the south-west of the continent most stations recorded a smoother
   trend to lower winter rainfall, although there is a small area with
   increased rainfall.  The identification of these trends in this study
   indicates that they are not the result of unreliable observations or to
   doubtful compositing of stations into groups.  These trends have now
   continued for some decades after their initial observation.  It is
   possible, however, that the twentieth century trends simply reflect a
   return to conditions of the late nineteenth century, rather than a trend
   that could be unambiguously attributed to an enhanced `greenhouse
   effect'.},

Abstract = {Mean monthly rainfall data of 28 meteorological stations in Nigeria for
   the period 1911-1980 are analysed to examine trends in precipitation
   patterns in the country. Specifically, four 40-year periods (1911-50,
   1921-60,1931-70 and 1941-80) have been studied in detail. Results show
   three prominent features. First, both the amount and area of the
   secondary rainfall maximum at 9.degree.-10.degree. N latitude in Nigeria
   has depreciated with time. Second, the belt of relative minimum
   rainfall, with its east-west axis almost coincident with the channels of
   the rivers Niger and Benue, appears to be expanding with time. Last,
   while places north of 8.degree. N latitude (the mean axis of the belt of
   relative minimum rainfall) receive 90-100\% of the annual total rainfall
   from April to October, fluctuations of the wet or rainy season
   contribution to total annual rainfall further south is about 84-88\%.
   These aberrations, which imply a decrease in the dry season contribution
   to the annual rainfall, suggest a drier environment in the long-term,
   especially if drought spells of the type 1969-73 and 1979-84 become a
   regular feature in West Africa. The planning implications are discussed
   in relation to water-use problems.},

Abstract = {Red and western gray kangaroo populations were monitored in Kinchega
   National Park and some adjoining sheep stations on a quarterly basis
   between 1973 and 1981. Kangaroos inside the Park were constrained while
   those outside were not. The years 1973-1976 experienced exceptionally
   high rainfall providing kangaroos with a superabundance of food. The
   preceding years were marked by the late 1960''s drought and low kangaroo
   densities, and the following years by average rainfall and high kangaroo
   densities. The kangaroo populations exhibited 2 general trends in
   relation to the exceptional and average rainfall years: a rapid rise and
   an asymptote. The average exponential rates of increase (.hivin.r)
   between 1973 and 1977 were 0.36 per annum {[}p.a.] and 0.27 p.a.,
   respectively, for red and western gray kangaroos inside the Park; and
   0.44 p.a. for both species outside. However, these rates were not
   significantly different. Since 1978 all populations had a zero average
   rate of increase and the high densities were maintained. There was no
   significant difference between the population dynamics of the kangaroos
   inside the park and on the adjoining sheep stations, regardless of
   densities being 2.5 times higher on the park. Competition for food by
   sheep may have suppressed kangaroo densities outside the park. The
   exponential rate of increase (r p.a.) of all populations was positively
   correlated with lagged rainfall. Rainfall and rate of increase of both
   species inside the park  exhibited regular trends on time. The
   regularity was strong for the western gray kangaroo but weak for the red
   kangaroo.},

Abstract = {Annual aerial counts of kangaroos {[}Macropus rufus, M. giganteus, M.

   New South Wales showed that the number of kangaroos doubled between
   1975-1976 and 1982, and that the widespread drought of 1982 reduced the
   populations on average by 43\%. Localized reductions of similar
   magnitude occurred after regional droughts in 1977 and 1980 within parts
   of the monitored area. The observed trends in kangaroo numbers, with
   eastern and western blocks treated separately, were correlated with
   annual rainfall with a time lag of 6 mo. in the response. The
   relationships show that kangaroos reach their maximum rate of increase
   following rainfall 100 mm above the annual average in the east and
   approximately 50 mm above the annual average in the west. At average
   annual rainfall kangaroos increase at 25\% (greys) and 35\% (reds) per
   annum in the east and at 25\% (greys) and 30\% (reds) per annum in the
   west. Rate of increase is zero when  rainfall is 100 mm below average in
   the east and approximately 60 mm below average in the west. When
   rainfall is below these values, kangaroo numbers decline.},

Journal = {NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {1983},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {379-401},
Abstract = {Soils and vegetation at 6 sites along a rainfall gradient in
   tall-tussock (Chionochloa) grassland on the east Otago uplands are
   described. Sites 1 to 4, at the wetter end of the sequence, are
   dominated by snow tussock, C. rigida, grassland; at site 5 snow tussock
   and red tussock, C. rubra, are present; and at the driest and lowest
   site only red tussock is present. The main differences of flora and
   physiognomic dominance between sites are attributed to past grazing and
   burning, altitude and soil moisture status. In the New Zealand soil
   classificaiton soils are upland podzolized yellow-brown earths at sites
   1 and 2 and very strongly leached upland yellow-brown earths at sites 3,
   4, 5 and 6. The soils are classified as a typic placaquept (site 1),
   dystric lithic cryochrepts (sites 2, 3, 4 and 5), and a dystric
   cryochrept (site 6). Soil morphology and soil chemistry show systematic
   trends along the rainfall gradient. At the wettest site leaching is most
   severe, giving low soil pH, base saturation, and acid-soluble P and high
   titratable acidity values. A gleyed horizon was present above a thin
   iron pan in which the dominant nondetrital mineral was ferrihydrite.
   Properties most affected by organic matter accumulation (e.g., total C,
   total N, CEC, and percent organic P) had highest values at this site, pH
   and acid-soluble P values were highest, and titratable acidity,
   phosphate-extractable sulfate, and percent organic P values lowest, at
   site 6. Sites other than 1 and 2 showed no sign of Fe or Al
   translocation within profiles. Chemical properties of the soils are
   largely a function of climate, rather than of the present vegetation.},

Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY},
Year = {1981},
Volume = {29},

Pages = {533-545},
Abstract = {Seasonal changes in the quantitative floristics at a wide range of
   Astrebla grassland sites in southwestern Queensland were monitored
   between 1972 and 1980 with a wheel point apparatus. Changes in the
   floristics were measured in terms of both relative abundance and basal
   cover. A large increase in the relative abundance of perennial grasses,
   particularly Aristida latifolia, Astrebla spp. and Dichanthium sericeum,
   occurred between 1972 and 1976. This increase was at the expense of
   annual grasses and forbs which declined in both relative abundance and
   number of genera present. The relative abundance of perennial grasses
   declined between 1978 and 1980 and this was associated with a large
   increase in the forbs such as Daucus glochidiatus and Plantago spp.,
   particularly at southern sites. The contribution of annual grasses to
   botanical composition remained low throughout the period. Total basal
   cover differed between years although these differences were not
   significant. As perennial grass, particularly Astrebla spp., was the
   major vegetation component of total basal cover, changes in the latter
   were associated mainly with changes in the basal cover of Astrebla spp.
   Changes in the contribution of individual species to total basal cover
   were related to changes in the relative abundance of those species.
   Changes in botanical composition in Astrebla grassland may be influenced
   more by trends in seasonal rainfall than by grazing pressure.},

Title = {Chennai is a rapidly urbanizing Indian megacity and experiences flooding
   frequently. Literature state that climate change and land use change
   have a significant impact on the runoff generated every year making it
   essential to study the historical trend and forecast changes in LULC and
   climate to model runoff. This study considered Adyar watershed for LULC
   change detection, climate change analysis, and flood forecasting for
   2030 and 2050 based on LULC and runoff of 2005 and 2015. A coupled
   hydrologic-hydraulic model (HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS) was developed to assess
   flooding for future LULC and climate scenarios. LULC analysis shows an
   increase in built-up cover by 6\%, and climate analysis shows a 74\%
   probability of an increase in precipitation intensity between 2015 and
   2050 compared to 2015. It was observed that depth of flooding increased
   by 19.4\% in 2030 and 60.4\% in 2050 compared to 2015. This study makes
   a structural proposition for flood mitigation through flood carrier
   canals on the downstream reach of the river, which flows through Chennai
   city. The canals were found to prevent overbanking, thereby providing
   complete protection against flooding. It is proved that this is the best
   possible measure that provides the highest flood reduction for the study
   area.},
